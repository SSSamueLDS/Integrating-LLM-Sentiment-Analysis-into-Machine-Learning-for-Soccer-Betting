        "article_text": "Paul Pogba scores as Man Utd beat Leicester 2-1 - Jose Mourinho praises captain\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho praised \"monster\" Paul Pogba after he captained the side and scored the opening goal in the win over Leicester City on the first day of the Premier League season.\nPogba - linked with Barcelona this summer - was a surprise starter only four days after his return to training, having won the World Cup with France just under a month ago.\nThe hosts made a flying start at Old Trafford, winning a penalty in the second minute when Daniel Amartey handled Alexis Sanchez's deflected shot.\nPogba stepped up and, after a typically nonchalant slow run-up, placed the ball in the top-right corner above Kasper Schmeichel.\nLeft-back Luke Shaw then scored the first senior goal of his career after controlling Juan Mata's aerial pass to double their lead.\nSubstitute Jamie Vardy headed a late consolation for Leicester after Ricardo Perreira's cross had hit a post, and Foxes goalkeeper Schmeichel came forward for an injury-time corner but his header went wide.\nPogba lasted 84 minutes before being replaced by Marouane Fellaini, but Mourinho said he did not expect the Frenchman to play for so long.\n\"Pogba was a monster,\" said the United boss. \"We thought maximum 60 minutes but he managed over 80.\n\"The decision belonged to Paul. I asked him and he made himself available and he was very good.\"\nJose Mourinho finds some harmony at last - Dion Dublin analysis\nFootball Daily: Pogba and Shaw put on a show\nFollow reaction to the game here\nLawro's opening-day predictions\nPogba steals the headlines\nPogba brought his World Cup form into the opening stages, producing a couple of excellent early passes before the opening goal.\nA penalty was fairly awarded with Amartey's arm high when he handled - although the video assistant referee was not an option to review the decision, with the Premier League the only one of Europe's top five leagues not using the system this year.\nPogba - with two stars shaved into his scalp to celebrate France's second World Cup win - had a brief word with Alexis Sanchez before deciding to take the kick himself.\nAfter an unusual staggered run-up, he scored, although his celebrations were muted. He has now scored in his last two games - his previous match being the World Cup final when he was on target in a 4-2 win over Croatia.\nBy the time he was replaced by Fellaini in the latter stages, at 2-0 up and seemingly safe, he had touched the ball more times and played more passes than any of his team-mates.\nHe came off to handshakes from the bench after a good job well done.\n\"I didn't have any pre-season games, I came back on Monday so it was very hard for the legs,\" said Pogba.\n\"Winning the World Cup is in the past. I like challenges, I want to progress and win more trophies.\"\nHow did United's unfamiliar faces do?\nUnited got their season off to a winning start but their performance, after a promising opening, left plenty of questions unanswered.\nMourinho has appeared grumpy all summer after failing to sign any of his centre-back targets - including Leicester's Harry Maguire, who played the full 90 minutes at Old Trafford.\nThe Red Devils fielded an unfamiliar back four, with Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof - who played a total of 99 minutes together last season - in the centre and Shaw and Matteo Darmian on the sides.\nBoth centre-backs did well to deal with the threat of bustling Leicester forward Kelechi Iheanacho, although Darmian was given a torrid time by Demarai Gray in the first half.\nShaw took advantage of his chance with his first goal since England Under-17s' 4-0 win over Lithuania in 2011. He took on Mata's high pass, beat Ricardo and then poked the ball beyond Schmeichel.\n\"Luke's game was very complete, even if I forget the goal,\" said Mourinho. \"He made maybe one mistake defensively in the whole match and the linesman could have helped him with a free-kick. He just has to keep going.\"\nShaw - who has had a difficult time at United - said: \"I don't want to speak too soon after one game but I want to be up there with the best left-backs in the world. I have the foundations to do that here with the manager and my team-mates.\"\nFred, a \u00a347m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk, was United's only debutant and looked solid - with passing accuracy of 92.3% - although he was booked for fouling James Maddison.\nHe was partnered in midfield by fellow Brazilian Andreas Pereira, who also turned in a steady performance on his first Premier League start.\nMarcus Rashford started up front, with Romelu Lukaku on the bench, although he did not have a single touch in the box or attempt a shot.\nHow did Leicester look?\nFoxes boss Claude Puel was thought to be in danger of being sacked this summer, but the club's owners instead backed him in a \u00a3100m spending spree.\nMaddison, a \u00a320m recruit from Norwich after 14 Championship goals last season, looked good in the first half - playing plenty of passes in dangerous areas, as well as testing De Gea from 16 yards out.\nRicardo was also bright before the break on the right wing - and had a shot saved by the United keeper, before having a hand in Vardy's late goal.\nAnother debutant, Rachid Ghezzal - Riyad Mahrez's summer replacement - came on in the second half, as did goalscorer Vardy.\nVardy's England team-mate Maguire was solid at the back for Leicester but unable to cause any of the mayhem he unleashed at the World Cup in the opposition box.\nWhere he failed, Schmeichel almost succeeded when he headed Ben Chilwell's corner just wide. Only five goalkeepers, including Kasper's father Peter, have scored in the Premier League.\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba\n'We deserved a minimum of a draw' - what they said\nFormer United boss David Moyes on BBC Radio 5 live: \"If you were picking the fixtures for United in the first nine or 10 games, you're not playing City, United, Chelsea. I wonder with Jose's words the other day - 'let's wait until November' - I'd be very surprised if United weren't top of the league come the end of November.\"\nLeicester boss Claude Puel to BBC Sport: \"It was a good game, a good performance from my team. Certainly we lacked more energy in the second half. That's normal for the first game.\n\"We conceded an early goal, it was harsh. It was not a good result but it's a good performance. We gave our best against a great team. We deserved a different result - we deserved a minimum of a draw.\"\nMatch stats - Pogba's joint record with Babel\nManchester United have won on the opening day in each of their past four seasons, their joint-longest run in the Premier League (also four in a row between 2000-01 and 2003-04).\nLeicester are winless in their past 16 away top-flight matches on the opening day of the season (D8 L8) since a 3-2 win at Aston Villa in August 1933.\nUnited have won eight of their past nine home Premier League games against Leicester (D1), winning all three under manager Jose Mourinho.\nMourinho is unbeaten in all 18 of his opening league matches of a season as a manager (W11 D7), winning nine of his 10 in the Premier League (D1).\nPogba has scored in 11 Premier League games and ended on the winning side in all of them - a joint record he shares with former Liverpool player Ryan Babel.\nLeicester have conceded the first goal of the Premier League season in each of the last three seasons, also doing so in 2016-17 against Hull City and 2017-18 against Arsenal.\nPogba's goal inside three minutes was Manchester United's fastest goal scored in a Premier League season opener - the previous fastest was Dwight Yorke after seven minutes against Everton in 1999-2000.\nShaw registered his first senior goal in his 134th appearance in all competitions (67 games each for Southampton and Man Utd).\nVardy has now ended on the losing side in four of the past five Premier League matches in which he's found the net (W1).\nWhat's next?\nUnited go to Brighton next Sunday (16:00 BST) in the second round of games, with Leicester hosting promoted Wolves on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Alli helps Tottenham to a 2-1 win over Newcastle\nTottenham opened their Premier League campaign with a victory at Newcastle for the second year running as goalline technology set them on their way.\nJan Vertonghen's early header put Spurs ahead, with technology confirming his effort had crossed the goalline by 9mm.\nThat advantage was short-lived as the hosts equalised 149 seconds later, when Joselu headed in Matt Ritchie's superb cross after being left unmarked six yards from goal.\nHowever Tottenham, fielding several of their World Cup stars including England's Harry Kane and Dele Alli, grew stronger as the game progressed.\nAnd as Newcastle's early energy began to wane, Alli put the visitors back in front, timing a back-post run to perfection to meet Serge Aurier's cross with a textbook header past home goalkeeper Martin Dubravka.\nNew signings Ki Sung-yueng, Fabian Schar, Salomon Rondon and Yoshinori Muto all started as substitutes for Rafael Benitez's team, who threatened to level for a second time after the break.\nBut Kenedy spurned a glorious opportunity with a poor first touch, Mohamed Diame thrashed a shot against the post and Rondon, on as a substitute, hit the crossbar with a deflected shot.\nIt was the second season in a row that Tottenham had won their opening fixture in the north east, with Alli scoring on both occasions.\nAll the action from the 3pm kick-offs\nLawro's predictions v Inbetweeners star\nNo signings, no problem for Spurs\nDespite declarations of contentment by manager Mauricio Pochettino, it is difficult to imagine that the Argentine's job will not be made more difficult this term by Spurs' inactivity in the transfer market.\nClubs at the top end of the Premier League all strengthened while Spurs became the first Premier League club to not make a summer signing since the current transfer window system was adopted in 2003.\nIn a summer when nine first-choice players had a virtually non-existent pre-season - after reaching the later stages of the World Cup - Pochettino was forced to field six of them against Newcastle.\nFrance's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, Belgium's Vertonghen and England's Alli, Kane and Eric Dier all started while Mousa Dembele was introduced midway through the second period.\nWith the familiarity of those players clear to see, Tottenham dominated possession with 60% of the ball.\nAnd Pochettino is now going to be reliant on those players to secure a top-three finish for the fourth year running.\nWorryingly for Tottenham, Kane's August Premier League goal drought continued into a 14th match that spans 988 minutes of action.\nIn a largely anonymous display, the England captain managed just four touches in the Newcastle penalty area but Pochettino said it was of no concern.\n\"He is in his best form whether he scores or doesn't score,\" he said. \"He worked a lot for the team and I'm sure that he's going to score. But he can't score three goals in every game.\"\nNewcastle revert to type\nIf it was a case of same old Spurs, Newcastle also reverted to type after an acrimonious summer in which the club was forced to defend its recruitment strategy and had been embroiled in a dispute with its players over bonuses.\nHaving outlaid just over \u00a320m on players, Newcastle supporters have questioned the perceived ambition of the club.\nAnd a large group of fans protested against Mike Ashley's ownership outside the city centre Sports Direct store before kick-off.\nRafael Benitez deployed an XI that featured nine of the players who dispatched Chelsea 3-0 on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign.\nHowever, with four of his five new permanent signings named as substitutes, Newcastle were unable to capitalise as Tottenham tired late on.\nRondon, who inherited the club's iconic number nine shirt, was introduced with 30 minutes remaining but touched the ball just 11 times.\nThe Venezuelan, who registered 15 league goals over the previous two seasons, will have his work cut out to emulate the feats of former favourites Jackie Milburn, Malcolm Macdonald, Andy Cole and Alan Shearer.\nMan of the match - Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham)\nWhat they said - 'Dele has been strong and focused'\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BBC Sport: \"To connect everything and start to mould the machine again was a massive challenge for everyone.\n\"The effort from the players was massive, it is not easy to provide them a good holiday and rest.\n\"I am happy in the way the players arrived after the holidays, and Dele [Alli] was one of them. He has been strong and focused and he has shown good quality today.\n\"It is important to be strong from the beginning and have belief and convey a positive message. The staff and the players need to stay together and the most important thing is the fans in a difficult time because we are going to move to a new stadium.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez speaking to BBC Sport: \"I think we deserved more. The team worked hard against a very good side. We conceded and reacted well, and then went a goal behind again and showed good fight.\"\nAsked about his team selection, Benitez added: \"We had to give something to the players that have been training for one month so it was the right thing to do. Now we have more time, and everybody has to fight for their place. You cannot complain about Joselu's work rate, and he got a goal which helped the team.\n\"We tried to change something and then we had a chance when [Salomon] Rondon hit the crossbar, but you can see the new players will need some time to settle and understand their team-mates.\"\nMatch stats - Alli goal a good omen for Spurs\nTottenham have won four of their past five Premier League away games against Newcastle (L1) - one more than they had won in their previous 19 trips to St James' Park in the competition (W3 D5 L11).\nNewcastle have lost five of their past six opening games to a league season, drawing the other vs Southampton in 2015-16.\nTottenham have scored in 25 of their past 26 Premier League games against Newcastle, failing only in a 0-1 home defeat in November 2013.\nThe first three shots on target in this match all came in the opening 18 minutes and were all scored, while none of the following four were converted.\nTottenham's Dele Alli has scored in 33 different Premier League games and never ended on the losing side (W27 D6). Only James Milner (47) and Darius Vassell (46) have ever scored in more without losing.\nTottenham defender Jan Vertonghen's goal was his first in 161 Premier League games, since netting against Swansea in March 2013.\nTottenham's Harry Kane has never scored a Premier League goal in August, despite playing 14 games, 988 minutes and attempting 46 shots.\nJoselu also scored Newcastle's opening Premier League goal in 2017-18 - he's the first player to score the Magpies' first goal in consecutive Premier League seasons.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle go to Cardiff next Saturday (12:30 BST) while Tottenham host Fulham on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-0 Cardiff City\nBournemouth spoiled Cardiff City's Premier League return with a hard-earned 2-0 victory.\nThe technically superior hosts were quick to dominate possession, pinning their opponents back in their own half for long periods and deservedly taking the lead when Ryan Fraser fired in from close range.\nBournemouth were then awarded a penalty when Callum Wilson was brought down after a tangle with Bruno Ecuele Manga, but the forward's low spot kick was well saved by Neil Etheridge.\nCardiff roused themselves in the second half with a flurry of chances from set pieces - the best seeing Sean Morrison thwarted a yard out by Asmir Begovic.\nBut Wilson struck in added time to give Bournemouth a first opening day win since they were promoted to the top flight in 2015.\nRelive Bournemouth's opening day victory against Cardiff City\nAll the action from Saturday's 3pm kick-offs\nThere was a sense of relief as the unseasonably heavy rain descended on the Vitality Stadium, where the hosts had looked set for a routine victory before they were unsettled by Cardiff's second-half resurgence.\nFor the visitors, despite competing with the tenacity expected from a Neil Warnock side, this was a harsh reminder of the chasm in quality between the Championship and the Premier League.\nBournemouth's lavish summer bears fruit\nLooking to improve on last season's 12th-place finish, Bournemouth had enjoyed a relatively lavish summer by their standards, signing young Wales forward David Brooks and full-back Diego Rico for more than \u00a310m each, and then breaking their transfer record to buy Colombia midfielder Jefferson Lerma for \u00a325m.\nNeither Lerma nor Rico were available here but Brooks supplemented a slick Bournemouth midfield and attack, whose movement and crisp passing often left Cardiff's players flailing.\nOne such example led to the opening goal midway through the first half, Wilson darting to the byline and pulling a low cross back to an unmarked Fraser, who finished firmly.\nCardiff had prided themselves on defensive solidity in the Championship but they struggled to get to grips with their opponents on this occasion, and Wilson was again a thorn in their side when he fell under a challenge from Ecuele Manga for what seemed quite a soft penalty.\nWilson's penalty miss threatened to prove costly as Bournemouth had to withstand a tirade of Cardiff set-pieces that almost resulted in an equaliser in the second half.\nUltimately, however, it was academic as it was Wilson who delivered the killer blow, meeting Simon Francis' cross to finish neatly in added time.\nCardiff's Premier League return\nThis was a more harmonious return to the Premier League for Cardiff, free of the discord of their previous one-season stay in the top flight in which a change to red shirts was the most divisive aspect of a tumultuous 2013-14 campaign.\nOwner Vincent Tan said this summer that he had learned from those mistakes and, with the team back in blue and the club united on and off the field, the feeling among many Bluebirds followers was that they would enjoy this season even if it were to end in relegation - as bookmakers had tipped.\nHowever, this is a Cardiff side used to confounding the odds, as they did by securing promotion from the Championship last season, a record eighth for Warnock.\nThe 69-year-old revels in the role of underdog and he is bullish about his team's prospects despite spending less than \u00a340m on six players this summer, in stark contrast to fellow promoted sides Fulham and Wolves, who have spent almost \u00a3150m between them.\nA solid defensive structure was the foundation for Cardiff's promotion last season, so Warnock will have been furious to see his side unlocked as easily as they were for Bournemouth's opening goal.\nHe will, however, have been a little more encouraged by his players' endeavour in the face of pressure from the hosts, and the way in which they fought back in the second half.\nMan of the match - Ryan Fraser\n'We needed this win' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe told BBC Sport: \"We had control of the first half and moved the ball well and didn't get penned in. The penalty gave us a platform to build from.\n\"The second half was a bit more nip and tuck but we stood up really well. We kept a clean sheet which we didn't do much last season which was good.\n\"If we can keep Ryan [Fraser] fit he'll be a big player for us this season. We needed this win after a poor start last year.\"\nCardiff City boss Neil Warnock told BBC Sport: \"I thought we did alright, we got better as the game went on. On another day we could have got a result but it wasn't to be.\n\"They were better in certain areas but not other. We had our chances and I'm disappointed. The penalty was soft. It just felt a little bit hard for us today at times.\n\"They are an established team in the Premier League and we could have got a result here on another day. We're looking forward to the season and a few lads were a bit nervous but once that rubbed off, it was okay.\"\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer: \"I do [think Cardiff will struggle] but they can look at is what Huddersfield achieved last season. When you look at what Fulham and Wolves have spent, Cardiff have bought four players from the Championship.\n\"They will be very difficult to beat at home, however. Neil Warnock will have them well organised at the Cardiff City Stadium and it will be very difficult for away teams.\"\nMatch stats\nBournemouth registered their first win on the opening day of a Premier League season, having lost their previous three\nCardiff have lost on the opening day in just two of their past 11 seasons (W5 D4) - but both have been in the Premier League (2013-14 and 2018-19)\nIn the Premier League, Bournemouth midfielder Ryan Fraser scored with his final shot of the 2017-18 season against Swansea City and his first shot of 2018-19 against Cardiff City.\nNeil Warnock has never won on the opening day of a top-flight season (D1 L3), failing with four different teams - Notts County in 1991-92, Sheffield United in 2006-07, QPR in 2011-12 and Cardiff in 2018-19.\nCardiff City goalkeeper Neil Etheridge became the first player from the Philippines to appear in the Premier League and was also the first goalkeeper to save a penalty on his Premier League debut since August 2013 (Allan McGregor for Hull City v Chelsea).\nThere is a gap in age of 28 years and 363 days between Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe (40 years, 255 days) and Cardiff boss Neil Warnock (69 years 253 days), the largest gap in age between two opposing managers on the opening day of a Premier League season.\nDespite failing to score a penalty in the first half, Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson was involved in more goals in this match (two, one goal, one assist) than in his previous 13 Premier League games combined (one).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to face West Ham at the London Stadium on 18 August (15:00 BST) while Cardiff face Newcastle at home (12:30 BST) earlier that day."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-2 Crystal Palace\nFulham began their return to the Premier League with a home defeat by Crystal Palace, who matched the new arrivals' adventurous display with a smart and clinical away performance.\nAt the end of a half defined by Fulham's failure to make more from slick passing and movement in attack, Patrick van Aanholt found Jeffrey Schlupp, who smashed home from inside the box amid slack marking from Calum Chambers.\nAleksandar Mitrovic had twice been denied by smart Wayne Hennessey stops, with Cyrus Christie also turned away from range, as seven new faces in the Fulham line-up showed few signs of failing to gel.\nBut Slavisa Jokanovic's side, whose squad has been boosted by 12 new signings, were kept at arm's length as Palace defended strongly and threatened on the break.\nIt was a pattern that grew in emphasis in the second half, despite Fulham having a big penalty claim turned down when Andre Schurrle went down under a Mamadou Sakho challenge in the box.\nJust moments later, Wilfried Zaha should have doubled the lead but his low shot inside the box was diverted behind by Fabri's legs.\nBut the Ivory Coast forward finally did seal the win with 11 minutes to play when coolly finishing under the Spanish goalkeeper after latching on to Aaron Wan-Bissaka's through ball.\nFulham - who drew 2-2 with Palace in their previous top-flight fixture in May 2014 - may feel the result does not tell the whole story of the match; they had 66.3% possession and mustered 14 shots at goal.\nHowever, it was Palace who emerged with greater reward from their share of the ball, from which they conjured nine shots on target, including two very well-taken goals.\nRelive Fulham v Crystal Palace\nReaction to the Premier League's Saturday\nNew-look Fulham start brightly but fade\nFive deadline-day signings on Thursday brought Fulham's total summer spend over the \u00a3100m mark - no promoted club has spent more before taking on English football's top flight.\nOnly Chelsea and Liverpool invested more, and the calibre of the signings the Cottagers made will have raised expectations beyond a 17th-placed finish.\nOn the surface at least, the west London club has strengthened in every position, and clearly the ambition is to continue the attractive style that brought them up as Championship play-off winners in May.\nThey started very brightly - for much of the first half you wondered whether Palace would be able to hang on - but after Schlupp's goal the zip and momentum that marked the game's early stages seemed to dim slightly.\nOf the new signings, Jean Michael Seri was Fulham's outstanding performer, dogged and stylish in midfield, but even the 27-year-old Ivorian, who was strongly linked to Barcelona last year, could not halt Palace's growing influence on the match in the second half.\nNew year, new start, old Palace\nLast season Palace began their campaign with a run of seven consecutive defeats in which they failed to score a single goal.\nIt was on 14 October 2017 when they finally found the net and won a game, beating Chelsea 2-1 at home under Roy Hodgson, his fourth match in charge following the sacking of Frank de Boer.\nOn Friday, Palace and Hodgson added an extra year to his contract, which now runs until 2020 - the reward for a strong end to the season that saw Palace climb the table and finish 11th.\nComing away from Craven Cottage with a valuable win earned through hard work and concentration in defiance of an exciting attacking line-up, Hodgson's team carried on here like they left off in May.\nThere were nervy moments - the decision not to punish Sakho for his slide on Schurrle most obviously, and Hennessey made several important saves - but Palace ultimately deserved victory, not only for the quality of their defensive performance but for their slick and sharp counter attacking, too.\nBy comparison with Fulham, a modest number of four new faces arrived at Selhurst Park this summer - two of which were absent from the squad - Jordan Ayew and Max Meyer.\nEx-West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate came on for his debut late on, with the three points already won, while goalkeeper Vicente Guaita, an observer from the bench, will have no chance of replacing Hennessey anytime soon on this form.\nMan of the match - Wayne Hennessey\nA first for Schlupp - the stats\nThis was only the third time in 10 Premier League campaigns that Palace won their opening match, with all of those victories coming away from home\nThis was Fulham's first league defeat at Craven Cottage since October 2017 (0-2 v Bristol City), ending a run of 15 without loss at home (W12 D3)\nFulham have won just 25 of their 119 Premier League London derbies (21%), the lowest win rate in such matches in the competition\nWilfried Zaha's strike was his 23rd in the Premier League for Palace - no player has scored more for the club in the competition (level with Chris Armstrong)\nJeffrey Schlupp scored his first Premier League goal for Crystal Palace, and first in the competition in 1043 days - since netting for Leicester against Norwich in October 2015\nPatrick van Aanholt has had a hand in five goals in his last four Premier League games for Crystal Palace (three goals, two assists)-\n'We must stick together' - what they said\nFulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Sport: \"It was a shame because we wanted to start the season with a good result. We showed some positives and negatives. We showed we can be brave and can move the ball, but we must stick together and keep going.\n\"Maybe it was a penalty or not, but we cannot complain about that, and they showed their quality in the second half. We have to trust ourselves and work hard, and we know we can play better than today.\n\"I used two players who have only been with us a few days and I need more time. Now we are going to have all week in front of us to work hard and not look behind.\n\"The Premier League is more power, more speed and more quality, and we must adapt. We followed the game plan and created some half chances but we didn't show enough quality in the opposition box and their goalkeeper made some saves.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson told BBC Sport: \"I thought we were much better in the second half. I thought Fulham played well in the first period and caused us problems, but our goalkeeper made some good saves.\n\"We had better control in the second half and it was difficult for them to come back into it. We showed the quality we are capable of in the second half.\n\"Vicente Guaita has been excellent for us in pre-season and, quite frankly, it was a toss of the coin between him and Wayne Hennessey. I would have been equally confident had Vicente played but Wayne Henessesy played well last season and there was no reason for him to surrender his shirt.\"\n'Fulham have to play quicker'\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright\nFulham started really well. They closed down Wilfried Zaha and didn't give him much space.\nBut the opportunities they had were few and far between.\nThey've got to get the ball into Aleksandar Mitrovic quicker. They're going to have to play a lot quicker or get the ball into him quicker."

Now I study my players.\"\nRelive Chelsea's win over Huddersfield as it happened\nPremier League reaction and analysis\nChelsea opted for a 4-3-3 formation, in contrast to the three centre-halves and wing-backs system used by former boss Antonio Conte.\nSarri, who became the club's 10th full-time manager in 10 years after Conte was sacked in the summer, saw his side take the lead with their first shot on target.\nIt came in the 34th minute when Kante's mis-hit strike from Willian's cross bounced past Huddersfield goalkeeper Ben Hamer.\nJorginho followed Sarri from Napoli to Chelsea in the summer and the midfielder doubled the Blues' lead when he converted a penalty after Christopher Schindler fouled Marcos Alonso.\nPedro sealed a comfortable win with a cool, chipped finish after being played in by substitute Hazard.\nBefore the second goal, the Terriers had hit a post through Steve Mounie's header, but it was to be Sarri's and Chelsea's day.\nA good day for the new boss\nChelsea's fifth-placed finish in 2017-18 and the resulting failure to secure Champions League qualification saw Conte get sacked in July, despite winning the Premier League in 2016-17 and lifting the FA Cup last season.\nSarri, 59, was chosen to replace him after guiding Napoli to second place in Serie A last season, although he had warned Chelsea's fans to \"expect some problems\" in their opening games and that it would take three months to find their best form.\nThey were not at their best against Huddersfield, but were still far too good for David Wagner's side.\nAfter a slow start, Kante, who helped France win the World Cup less than a month ago, gave Chelsea the lead, and it became 2-0 when Jorginho calmly converted the penalty.\nThat goal, just before half time, changed the game and Huddersfield struggled to create chances and gain possession in the second half.\nAn acrobatic effort from Alonso hit the crossbar and, as the hosts pushed for a way back into the game, they were caught on the break when Hazard set up Pedro, who sealed the victory.\nHow did the new players fare?\nChelsea paid \u00a371m to sign goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga when Thibaut Courtois joined Real Madrid. It was a clean sheet on his debut for Kepa, although he was well beaten by Mounie's header after a corner had been flicked on, but the ball bounced back off the post.\nKepa only had to make one save, a very routine stop as he caught Alex Pritchard's 25-yard effort, which was straight at him.\nItalian international Jorginho, who worked with Sarri for three years at Napoli, operated as one of three narrow central midfielders and immediately looked at home, with an impressive performance and a 93.9% pass accuracy completion record.\nFor Huddersfield, Ben Hamer, who signed on a free transfer from Leicester during the summer, was sometimes let down by his distribution, but there was little he could have done for any of the three goals.\nNetherlands international Terence Kongolo impressed for Huddersfield, including one perfectly-timed sliding challenge to stop Willian, but the hosts were powerless to stop Chelsea.\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante (Chelsea)\nHuddersfield's home problems continue - the stats\nIncluding caretakers, Maurizio Sarri is the ninth consecutive Chelsea manager to avoid defeat in his first Premier League game in charge, with Avram Grant the last to lose his debut fixture (0-2 v Manchester United in September 2007).\nChelsea's 3-0 win was the largest margin of victory in their first Premier League game under a new manager since 2008, when Luiz Felipe Scolari oversaw a 4-0 win against Portsmouth.\nChelsea have not suffered an opening day defeat away from home in the Premier League since 1998-99 (2-1 v Coventry), winning six and drawing one of their seven such games since.\nHuddersfield have lost five of their last seven opening games of a league campaign (won two), failing to score in each of those five defeats.\nHuddersfield have picked up just nine points from their last possible 36 in Premier League home games (won two, drawn three, lost seven), with the first game in this run being a 1-3 defeat against Chelsea last season.\nN'Golo Kante's opener for Chelsea was his first Premier League goal since September, and just his fourth in 107 appearances in the competition overall.\nJorginho has scored 10 of the 11 penalties he has taken in the top five European leagues (all competitions) for three different clubs (Verona, Napoli and Chelsea).\nWillian has been directly involved in four of Chelsea's six Premier League goals at the John Smith's Stadium, scoring one and assisting another three.\n'Very difficult against physical opponents' - what they said\nHuddersfield Town head coach David Wagner speaking to BBC Sport: \"Chelsea were very clinical. They had four or five chances and scored three. We started very well in the first half. We pressed them high and the players did very well.\n\"We had a very good opportunity at 1-0 where Steve Mounie hits the post and instead of being a goal up we were a goal down. And then just before half-time we made a tactical mistake to concede a penalty.\n\"We tried to create opportunities in the second-half and we hit the bar and then we conceded another goal on the counter where Eden Hazard shows his top quality.\n\"I've seen enough to be confident for the Premier League season, because we will not always meet the top, top teams. If you want a result from these games, the small margins have to go in your favour.\"\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri speaking to BBC Sport: \"The game was more difficult than the result. If you see the result, you think it was a very easy match, but in the first half it was very difficult against physical opponents.\n\"We are not a physical team so for 20 minutes we were in trouble but we did very well. In this moment we are not at the top of our potential but we had the capacity to suffer for 20 minutes in the first half.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea face what looks to be a tougher task in their next match as they entertain Arsenal in the Premier League on 18 August (17:30 BST). Huddersfield's challenging start to their Premier League season continues as they play away at champions Manchester City on 19 August (13:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Premier League: Roberto Pereyra stars as Watford beat Brighton 2-0\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton said he was left to \"wonder what happened\" after his side were comfortably beaten by Watford at Vicarage Road.\nThe Hornets' Argentine midfielder Roberto Pereyra scored both goals - the first a sweet volley 10 minutes before the break, after he was left unmarked from a Jose Holebas corner.\nShortly after half-time the 27-year-old former Juventus man got his second after driving into the area and curling the ball beyond a helpless Mat Ryan from a tight angle.\n\"Sometimes you wonder what happened - pre-season was fine. We have some new signings but the team that played today was the same as last season, so no excuses,\" added Hughton.\nRelive Watford's win over Brighton as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nThe Seagulls, who finished last season a point and a place behind Watford in 15th, bought on club record signing Alireza Jahanbakhsh and fellow summer signing Yves Bissouma, but Hornets goalkeeper Ben Foster was rarely troubled.\nThe visitors - hampered by the loss of captain Bruno, who was forced off early on by what appeared to be a hamstring injury - failed to muster a single effort on target and Watford were worthy winners.\n\"It troubles me when any opposition keeper has as easy a day as Ben Foster had,\" said Hughton. \"We didn't deserve anything from today.\n\"We've got work to do. A disappointing result but more so a disappointing performance.\"\nPereyra provides a spark\nIt is only the first game of the season, but Watford boss Javi Gracia will surely be deeply satisfied with the way his side controlled this match throughout.\nThe Spaniard, appointed late in January after the sacking of predecessor Marco Silva, is the 10th manager to work for Watford under the Pozzo family since 2012.\nHis activity in the summer transfer window was solid, if not spectacular, but he also lost forward Richarlison to Everton for a fee reported to be worth as much as \u00a350m.\nAnd this display was a welcome sign for Hornets supporters that their side can still pack a punch - the combination of Holebas and Pereyra a case in point.\nWatford fielded a settled team, with the only debutant being 35-year-old keeper Foster, who had two loan spells at Vicarage Road between 2005 and 2007 while at Manchester United.\nPundits and BBC Sport readers expect the Hertfordshire club to struggle to avoid the drop, but this performance is an indication that they are up for the fight.\nSeagulls stutter\nBrighton's pragmatic summer activity had drawn praise - the Seagulls have kept the core of the squad which secured survival last season, while finding perceived value in their transfer dealings.\nThey made Iran's Jahanbakhsh - the top scorer in the Dutch Eredivisie last season - their club record signing, alongside bringing in a mix of youth and experience in the likes of 30-year-old Nigeria defender Leon Balogun and 21-year-old Mali midfielder Yves Bissouma from Lille.\nLike Watford, manager Hughton's starting XI featured just one new face in the form of left-back Bernardo, but unlike their hosts, the old guard were unable to impress.\nWhether Brighton will now look to use their new recruits to shake up their typical 4-4-1-1 shape in the coming weeks remains to be seen, but this display was a cause for concern.\nAnd it will not get any easier, with back-to-back games against Manchester United and Liverpool to come.\nFoster second only to Rooney - stats\nWatford are unbeaten in their past 12 opening games to a league season (W6 D6), with their last defeat coming against Everton in August 2006.\nBrighton are winless in their past 14 Premier League away games (W0 D4 L10), the longest current such run in the division.\nWatford have lost only one of their past nine Premier League matches at Vicarage Road (W5 D3).\nRoberto Pereyra has had a hand in each of Watford's past six Premier League goals, scoring five and assisting one.\nBen Foster made his first Premier League appearance for Watford since 13 May 2007 vs Newcastle (4,108 days ago) - the second-longest gap between two games for a single team in the competition after Wayne Rooney for Everton (4,837 days).\nMan of the match - Roberto Pereyra (Watford)\nThey thought we'd struggle without Richarlison - what they said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia:\n\"I'm very happy with the result, but happier with the way we got it. They didn't have any shots on target or create any chances.\n\"The team showed a good reaction after losing the ball and I am very happy for them.\"\nWatford captain Troy Deeney:\n\"He's not a bad player, he [Pereyra] played in the Champions League final. People think we would fall apart because Richarlison left, [but] this is a great squad. We've got Nathaniel Chalobah and Gerard Deulofeu to come back.\n\"Credit to Ben Foster too, his kicking was sensational and kept us out of trouble. We've been working on our intensity and it has been working and that's why I look so skinny.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton:\n\"I thought we were second best, Watford were better in most departments.\n\"There were periods we could create something and hold the ball, but overall we did not show enough to get something from the game.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford's first away trip of the season sees the Hornets travel to Burnley on Sunday, 19 August (13:30 BST).\nLater the same day, Brighton host Manchester United at the Amex Stadium (16:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Richarlison scores twice but Wolves come back to draw 2-2 with Everton\nEverton manager Marco Silva said he \"doesn't have doubts\" about Richarlison after the big money summer signing scored twice on his debut in an entertaining draw at Premier League newcomers Wolves.\nThe Toffees - reduced to 10 men at the end of the first half when Phil Jagielka was sent off for a dangerous challenge on Diogo Jota - were left frustrated as Wolves twice fought back to claim a point.\nThe potential \u00a350m signing of Brazilian winger Richarlison raised eyebrows in the summer, particularly since he endured a run of 28 games without a goal in 2017-18, last finding the net in November.\nBut he repaid his manager's faith when he stabbed home his first from close range, before stroking in a delightful second to restore the lead.\nRuben Neves' free kick - from the tackle which saw Jagielka sent off - had brought Wolves level, and they eventually rescued a point when on-loan Benfica forward Raul Jimenez buried a header from Neves' cross with 10 minutes remaining.\nNew Everton boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport: \"I don't have doubts. Even when Richarlison doesn't score he works really hard to help his team. I'm sure the fans will be proud of him.\n\"He did very well. He worked hard, which is what I expect from him.\"\nRicharlison said he would remember the day for \"the rest of my life\".\nChelsea off to flying start as newcomers fail to win - Premier League round-up\nRelive the draw at Molineux\nWolves spoil Richarlison-Silva reunion\nSilva was linked with a move to Goodison Park last season but Everton appointed Sam Allardyce instead, who oversaw an eighth-place finish.\nSilva was sacked by Watford in January with the Hornets blaming Everton's interest for a downturn in form. The Toffees finally got their man this summer after dismissing Allardyce.\nThe Portuguese's first signing was Richarlison from his former club and much was made about the fee.\nBut it looks to be a shrewd move by Silva to link up again with the 21-year-old, who displayed his qualities inside and outside the box.\nPlaying from the left, he posed a dangerous threat to Wolves wing-back Matt Doherty and his 13 sprints during his 86 minutes on the pitch was bettered only by team-mate Seamus Coleman (15).\nRicharlison opened the scoring with an opportunistic strike as Wolves failed to clear a Leighton Baines free-kick into the box, while his second was a measured finish into the far corner.\nHe also came close to making a goal when his knockdown fell nicely in the box for Theo Walcott, but the former Arsenal man's scuffed shot failed to threaten Rui Patricio.\nRicharlison added: \"I have to thank my colleagues because we had to run double with one player less, so it is a special day for me.\"\nEverton would have been in a better position to claim all three points had Jagielka not been dismissed after losing control of the ball deep in his own half and catching Jota on the shin in trying recover possession.\n\"Phil Jagielka's red card was a harsh decision,\" said Silva. \"Not only the red card but they scored from the free-kick.\"\nBattling Wolves impress on return\nWolves won the Championship with ease last season, claiming 99 points as they returned to the top flight for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign, when they finished bottom.\nThey spent big money in the summer on eight recruits, helped by agent Jorge Mendes' contacts, including the signings of former Sporting Lisbon goalkeeper Patricio and international team-mate Joao Moutinho from Monaco.\nIn all, manager Nuno Espirito Santo fielded five of his Portuguese compatriots - a Premier League record - and he will be pleased by the fighting spirit shown by his team.\nAlthough they struggled to impose themselves on the game early on, Wolves battled back to earn a point on a day when fellow promoted sides Fulham and Cardiff went down to 2-0 defeats.\nNuno said: \"We have character because we came back from a goal down twice, which is not easy.\n\"Today taught me that we can react to goals but we have a lot to improve. We have always known we have quality but we are in a growing process. It was the first time for a lot of us in the Premier League but we will get better and better.\"\nEx-Porto captain Neves was one of the best players in the Championship last season and he impressed on his step up by scoring one goal and making the other.\nHe looked comfortable in possession too - his 111 touches on the ball and 93 passes were more than any other player on the pitch - and he contributed defensively by winning the ball back six times.\nNeves said: \"I am very happy to help the team achieve a point but we want to win games, mainly at home.\"\nWolves have been tipped by many pundits to claim a top-half finish this season and they could well achieve that target after making a promising start to the new campaign.\nJagielka challenge 'endangered' Jota\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer\nI thought it [Phil Jagielka's red card] was the correct decision. It's a poor touch he knows he's in trouble. It's endangered Diogo Jota and there's not too much argument.\nHe uses excessive force and he's out of control. It's a straight leg and a red card. Whether you agree with the laws or not, that's the law.\nMan of the match - Ruben Neves (Wolves)\nWolves player's long wait - the stats\nWolves are now seven league matches without a victory against Everton (D5 L2) since a 2-1 win in May 2004.\nEverton have drawn their past three opening day Premier League matches against newly promoted sides, also doing so in 2014-15 against Leicester City and 2015-16 against Watford - all finished 2-2.\nRicharlison found the net with his first two shots in the Premier League for Everton, having failed to score with any of his last 53 shots as a Watford player.\nSince the start of last season, Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves has scored more goals from outside the box than any other player in the top four tiers of English league football (seven).\nEverton's red card was their 90th in the Premier League - more than any other side.\nWolves defender Matt Doherty made his second Premier League appearance - 2,513 days after his first in September 2011; only two outfield players have had a longer wait for their second appearances - Erik Nevland (3,667) and Darren Pratley (2,835)."

Mane appeared marginally offside as he collected Roberto Firmino's pass, but the flag stayed down and he drilled his effort beyond new West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nNew signing Naby Keita, a \u00a350m acquisition from RB Leipzig, impressed in midfield for Jurgen Klopp's side.\nHe contributed to Liverpool's first goal and delivered the kind of driving performance that Steven Gerrard once produced wearing the number eight shirt.\nSubstitute Daniel Sturridge rounded off the scoring with his first touch, 24 seconds after coming on, to ensure Liverpool recorded their 500th victory in the Premier League era.\nIt also maintained their fine Anfield record against West Ham, who have now won just one of their past 46 top-flight visits.\nLiverpool underline title credentials\nLiverpool finished fourth last season, 25 points behind Premier League champions Manchester City.\nHowever, the nature of their emphatic Champions League quarter-final victory over Pep Guardiola's side in April, coupled with a league win over City, suggested they could challenge them this term.\nLiverpool's attacking prowess has not been in question in recent times.\nThe front three of Salah, Firmino and Mane contributed 91 of the club's 135 goals last season and they were on song again as Liverpool put four goals past West Ham for the fourth time in a row.\nSalah's instinct to find the right position allowed him an easy first, while Mane's intelligence brought him off the wing into central positions for both his goals.\nKlopp compared his team to \"Rocky Balboa\" in the build-up to this game but the depth of his substitutes' bench and this result may soon see them shed that tag.\nThe German introduced new signing Xherdan Shaqiri, England midfielder Jordan Henderson and Sturridge from the bench but still had midfielders Adam Lallana and Fabinho in reserve.\n\"The performance of all the boys and the midfield of James [Milner] and Georginio Wijnaldum was outstanding,\" Klopp added.\n\"We played as good as possible today and we extended a really good pre-season into the Premier League.\"\nTough opening assignment for Hammers\nIf last term turned into a tale of battling for Premier League survival, the arrival of new manager Manuel Pellegrini and nine summer signings was supposed to bring renewed optimism to West Ham supporters.\nThe Chilean has promised a return to attacking football, after some supporters perceived the style of play in recent seasons as a departure from the 'West Ham way'.\nAn opening fixture at Anfield was hardly a barometer to judge early progress though.\nThe Hammers have lost more top-flight games against Liverpool than any other side and despite spending around \u00a3100m on new recruits, this was always going to be a difficult assignment.\n\"It was a tough game before the game, during the game and after the game,\" Pellegrini said.\n\"They reached the final of the Champions League and bought a lot of new players.

But McCarthy was equal to it, getting down low to his right.\nBurnley started the second half in a similar fashion and McCarthy was called into action again as Stephen Ward was first to the second ball following a corner, but the Saints keeper showed good speed to prevent the ball from crossing the line.\nSouthampton grew into the game after introducing Ings and Elyounoussi, but Hart was in impressive form to deny Stephens, and Dyche will be buoyed by his side's performance after three matches in Europe.\nIngs shows promise for 'local' club\nIngs - who was born 13 miles from Southampton - completed a deadline-day loan move from Liverpool, which will become a permanent transfer next summer.\nWith Burnley still dominant, Saints manager Mark Hughes opted to introduce Ings in the second half and the 26-year-old was welcomed by a standing ovation from the home fans.\nHis arrival appeared to give the rest of the team a lift and the striker was quickly in the action. With the hosts beginning to build momentum, Ings arrived right on cue to meet a corner ahead of his marker, but his fierce effort flew over the bar.\nAs well as posing a threat to the opposition's goal, Ings also showed signs of creativity as his well-weighted pass to the back post created the chance for Stephens that Hart saved.\nHughes spoke very highly of Ings upon his return to the south coast, saying he had \"admired\" the former Bournemouth forward for some time.\nAnd based on Sunday's 40-minute showing, the Saints manager has lots to be optimistic about.\nMan of the match - Alex McCarthy (Southampton)\nWhat they said - 'It is not easy to dominate away from home like we did'\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said: \"In the first 70 minutes, we could have turned that into all three points.\n\"A clean sheet away from home is always a good thing especially as they came back into it after a change of shape. You have to have a good mentality in the Premier League and we have a good balance of mentality and quality.\"\nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes said: \"I was a bit concerned that Burnley had more competitive games albeit a tough trip in Europe.\n\"We didn't get them on the back foot and they had control in the first half and caused us problems. We changed it in the second half and controlled it. We had any number of chances to win the game.\n\"You saw Danny's clever play today, linking and retaining possession. He allowed us to move further up the field and that augurs well. We're looking forward to getting him up to speed.\"\nSouthampton striker Danny Ings said: \"It meant a lot to play for Southampton. I've had such a tough time over the past few years trying to break into a team that's one of the best in Europe.\n\"It was time for a new challenge and I thought that coming home was the right move.

I cannot complain for one minute.\"\nDefeat in Emery's opener is a reality check for Arsenal - Keown\nRelive the game and read more reaction\nHow you rated the players\nCity are the team to beat again\nPep Guardiola's City, who looked good in the 2-0 Community Shield win over Chelsea, were in fine form again. They only signed one first-team player - Mahrez in a \u00a360m record deal - in the summer, and he went straight into their Premier League line-up.\nSterling, who was selected on the left wing over Leroy Sane, opened the scoring when he received a pass from Mendy, making his first Premier League start since September.\nThe England winger received the ball on the left corner of the box, beat Hector Bellerin and Matteo Guendouzi and then rifled a 20-yard shot past Cech, who must have been unsighted as he barely moved.\nIt was his 50th Premier League goal and a good start to the season after being harshly criticised during England's World Cup semi-final run.\n\"I couldn't wait for my holidays to finish,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I needed to get back and I'm really happy I could be involved today. I wanted to play and it's great that we got three points.\"\nBy that stage Bernardo and Sterling had already had shots saved by Cech at his near post.\nCity kept pushing for a second goal that their performance deserved and went close when Arsenal's keeper denied Mahrez and Laporte.\nMahrez curled another shot just wide late in the first half. The Algerian put in a good performance on the right, and but was replaced by Kevin de Bruyne on the hour mark.\nRecord goalscorer Sergio Aguero should have had his 202nd City goal when he was played in one-on-one from the halfway line but he shot right at Cech - with De Bruyne free in the centre.\nBernardo finally sealed the points when he finished from Mendy's cutback.\nCity keeper Ederson played a few nervy passes late on - although Arsenal could not capitalise - and De Bruyne almost added a third with the last kick but Cech tipped his shot over.\n\"Every season is a major season and this game was complicated but we played at a high level. We created a lot of chances and our performance was good. We keep going,\" said Guardiola.\n\"We are satisfied for many, many reasons.\n\"At 1-0 we found a goal maybe we didn't deserve but in the first half we deserved to score two or three more.\"\nHow did new-look Arsenal perform?\nIt would be unfair to judge Arsenal - or Emery, who replaced legendary manager Wenger this summer - based on a performance against the country's outstanding team. The Spaniard failed to beat Guardiola in their first 10 meetings in La Liga and Europe and was never likely to end that run at the Emirates.\nArsenal started off brightly for the first five minutes and ended the first half strongly, with Aubameyang firing wide from 20 yards and Henrikh Mkhitaryan shooting into the side netting.\nTwo players made debuts from the start - experienced Greek centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos, a signing from Borussia Dortmund, and teenage holding midfielder Guendouzi, who was playing in France's second division with Lorient last season.\nGuendouzi showed some good moments with tackles and passes although was beaten for Sterling's opener and allowed Aguero in for the one-on-one chance he should have finished.\nHe is likely to have a big role under Emery this season and when Lucas Torreira came on for his second-half debut, it was fellow defensive midfielder Granit Xhaka and not Guendouzi replaced.\n\"It's his first match here in the Premier League. He has personality and quality and if he is on the pitch he is improving very quickly,\" Emery told BBC Match of the Day.\nCech started in goal, instead of \u00a319m summer signing Bernd Leno and justified his place with good stops from Bernardo, Sterling, Aguero and De Bruyne and especially the double save to deny Mahrez and Laporte.\nWith Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac injured, Emery had suggested he could play forward Danny Welbeck at left-back - but Ainsley Maitland-Niles, usually a midfielder, got the nod instead.\nThe 20-year-old was given a torrid time by Mahrez and especially Kyle Walker, and ended up going off after 35 minutes when he hurt himself while stopping another Walker run.\nVeteran Swiss right-back Stephan Lichsteiner came on for his debut on the left side in his place.\nThere were clear signs that Arsenal - who played a 4-2-3-1 - need more time to get used to the new system or gel with the fresh faces - with Ramsey - who only completed seven passes - Aubameyang and Ozil all playing the ball into empty space in the second half.\nWhen City goalkeeper Ederson gifted Arsenal a late chance, Ozil mis-controlled the ball back to the goalkeeper.\n\"The result was 2-0 but I think on the pitch over the 90 minutes we were getting better,\" Emery said.\n\"The first half we didn't play like we wanted. We spoke at half-time about taking more responsibility for the second half, to do a little more. We wanted to build with the ball and break their lines. I think in the second half we played more like we want.\"\nThe former Sevilla and Paris St-Germain boss enjoyed the Emirates atmosphere. \"We wanted to start here with our supporters. We wanted to show our performance but it is clear against Manchester City we could not give them this win. But I think here we are going to feel very well.\"\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)\nAgree? Disagree? Find out how you rated the players here\n'We could have got something' - what they said\nArsenal keeper Petr Cech speaking to BBC Sport: \"We feel that we could have got something from the game. In the second half, we forced them to make mistakes and we had some opportunities. Unfortunately, we lacked invention to find the killer pass.\n\"When you play against a team of City's quality and confidence it is always going to be difficult. Inevitably, you can make a few mistakes.\n\"It was a shame we couldn't finish off our counter attacks and overall we're disappointed with the defeat.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Chris Sutton: \"Let's not judge Arsenal on this performance against the best team in the land. I think they have shown grit, resolve and desire but I have been disappointed with them in the final third.\n\"City have laid down their marker on the Premier League with this performance. People could dismiss it as same old Arsenal which would be unfair in Unai Emery's first game. You have to say it though, they were outclassed in every department today.\"\nArsenal's opening-day woes - match stats\nArsenal have just two victories in their last nine opening weekend Premier League games, drawing three and losing three.\nCity are unbeaten in their last 10 opening Premier League fixtures (W9 D1), winning the last eight in a row.\nEmery is the first of Arsenal's last six managers (including caretakers) to lose his first league game in charge of the club, since Steve Burtenshaw lost 1-0 against Tottenham in March 1986.\nGuardiola remains unbeaten against Emery in all competitions, winning seven and drawing four of the 11 meetings.\nGuendouzi is the 27th French player to play for Arsenal in the Premier League - a joint record high with Newcastle.\nLichtsteiner is the oldest outfield player to make his Premier League debut for Arsenal, at 34 years and 208 days.\nSterling has now scored 50 Premier League goals, with his opener against Arsenal only his third from outside the box.\nSterling has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last 12 Premier League appearances, scoring five and assisting seven.\nMendy registered two assists in a game in Europe's big five leagues for only the second time ever (also for Monaco v Nice in February 2017) and for the first time ever away from home.\nBernardo has scored five goals in his last seven Premier League starts for Manchester City after failing to score in his first nine.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal manager Unai Emery has got a really tough start - he follows this game up with a trip to Chelsea next Saturday (17:30 BST). City host Huddersfield on Sunday (13:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 0-0 Newcastle: Kenedy misses late penalty for 10-man Magpies\nCardiff City goalkeeper Neil Etheridge saved an injury-time penalty from 10-man Newcastle United's Kenedy, as the newly promoted hosts earned a first point of the Premier League season in dramatic fashion.\nA full-blooded and evenly contested first half contained chances at both ends, and Kenedy was lucky not to be sent off for kicking Victor Camarasa off the ball.\nBacked by a raucous home crowd, Cardiff dominated after the break and should have led when Kenneth Zohore headed wide, before Newcastle substitute Isaac Hayden was dismissed for scything down Josh Murphy from behind.\nZohore had another chance to score with a close-range header that was cleared off the line by Jacob Murphy, but Rafael Benitez' side reorganised efficiently and were awarded a penalty deep into added time when Bluebirds captain Sean Morrison handled a cross from Yoshinori Muto.\nHowever, for a second match in succession, Etheridge saved a spot-kick to prompt jubilant celebrations among Cardiff fans who minutes earlier had seemed disappointed by the prospect of a goalless draw.\nIt was a memorable moment for the home side, albeit one which perhaps masked their attacking deficiencies as they failed to score and managed just one shot on target for a second game in a row.\nRelive the action from Cardiff City Stadium\nReaction from all of Saturday's other Premier League matches\nKenedy's match to forget\nNewcastle's loss to Tottenham on the opening weekend was set against a backdrop of discontent among the Magpies' supporters, who protested against Mike Ashley's ownership before kick-off after another acrimonious summer during which the club had to defend their transfer strategy.\nThat ill feeling was offset slightly by the team's competitive display against Spurs, though they struggled to play at the same level in south Wales.\nBenitez's men created a handful of chances - with Etheridge making some decent saves - but they were fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men before half-time.\nAfter losing possession, midfielder Kenedy lunged towards Cardiff's Camarasa and, after the ball had gone, he took a wild swipe at the Spaniard's legs - which referee Craig Pawson somehow missed.\nIt capped a first half the Brazilian is likely to want to forget - as he became the first player since 2010 to play 45 minutes or more in a Premier League match without completing a single pass.\nKeeping Kenedy on the pitch was a reprieve for Newcastle, but they had no such fortune when Hayden - filling in at right-back after replacing the injured Javier Manquillo at half-time - caught Murphy above his ankle with a reckless lunge from behind.\nHayden may have trudged off the field fearing he would be cast as the villain of the piece, but Kenedy's final act of the game - a tame penalty comfortably saved by Etheridge to deny Newcastle an improbable win - meant that role would be his.\n\"Kenedy struggled today, he didn't complete a pass in the first half\" said former England defender Alex Scott on Final Score. \" Sometimes as a player when things are not going your way you think 'I'll step up and score to get me on my way', but that didn't happen for him today.\nEtheridge to Cardiff's rescue\nCardiff had endured a chastening re-introduction to the Premier League when they were outplayed for much of their 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth on the opening weekend.\nTheir brief moments of encouragement on that occasion came from set-pieces - and it was a similar tale here, with Sol Bamba close to scoring with a header which was blocked by Ayoze Perez.\nWhile their threat from corners and free-kicks remained, Cardiff were vastly better in open play on Saturday.\nDebutants Harry Arter and Camarasa gave them control and a greater share of possession in midfield, while winger Josh Murphy - twin of Newcastle's Jacob - was a handful on his first start for the club.\nAnd although the new signings were integral to Cardiff's improvement, it was one of the players who helped them win promotion from the Championship who proved to be their saviour.\nEtheridge had marked his top-flight debut with a penalty save from Callum Wilson last weekend, and while that did not affect the outcome, his stop from Kenedy was a match-defining intervention.\nHaving become the first Filipino to play in the Premier League against the Cherries, it was also another bit of history for the goalkeeper - denying Kenedy made him the first keeper to save a penalty in each of his first two appearances in the division.\nMan of the match - Josh Murphy\n'A poor penalty'\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez on Match of the Day: \"It was a difficult game against a physical team, and we played a lot with 10 players.\n\"We had Javier Manquillo who was injured and then Hayden came in and got sent off - so we had too many problems. In the end to get a point, it could be better, but we cannot complain too much.\"\nOn Kenedy's miss: \"It was a poor penalty, he's not happy he missed a good chance. We win as a team and lose as a team. I am not concerned about the fact he missed a penalty - he has to take responsibility.\"\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock on Match of the Day: \"I don't think the lads deserved to lose with a penalty like that.\n\"Kenedy was a lucky lad [when he kicked out]. There is stuff to work on for us - we were disappointing with our free-kicks.\n\"No disrespect, but having watched Birmingham last night, thank goodness we came out to a full house to play Newcastle in the Premier League.\"\nBenitez's milestone and Cardiff's goal drought\nCardiff have failed to score in three consecutive league games for the first time since November 2015.\nNewcastle are now unbeaten in their past 11 league meetings with Cardiff - winning 10 - since a 0-1 defeat in February 1981.\nCardiff have failed to score in their opening two games of a top-flight season for the first time since 1952-53.\nBenitez oversaw his 50th Premier League game as Newcastle manager - he has won 15, drawn 13 and lost 22.\nCardiff manager Warnock is now winless in his past 10 matches against Newcastle (W0 D3 L7), since a 1-0 win as Sheffield United boss in November 2006.\nOnly Everton (nine), Blackburn (seven) and Southampton (six) have had more substitutes sent off in the Premier League than Newcastle (five, also Manchester City, Manchester United and Sunderland).\nEtheridge is the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in two consecutive Premier League appearances in the same season since Thomas Sorensen for Stoke (against Arsenal and Wigan Athletic) in December 2009.\nWhat's next?\nCardiff travel to Huddersfield next Saturday (15:00 BST kick-off), while Newcastle host Chelsea on Sunday, 26 August (16:00)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-1 Southampton: Theo Walcott and Richarlison give Toffees victory over Saints\nEverton held off a resurgent Southampton side to mark Marco Silva's first competitive home match as Toffees boss with victory at Goodison Park.\nTheo Walcott provided the reward for early pressure when stabbing home from a rehearsed free-kick after 15 minutes, latching onto Morgan Schneiderlin's disguised pass.\nWalcott then turned provider as Richarlison doubled the lead, battling his marker and sending a header thumping past Alex McCarthy for his third Everton goal in two games.\nBefore the break, Jordan Pickford produced a remarkable sprawling save to deny Danny Ings when his own error had left the striker an open goal to aim at.\nBut the former Liverpool man did find the net nine minutes after half-time when turning home from a clever Mario Lemina flick at James Ward-Prowse's corner.\nIngs was totally unmarked in the six-yard box, and his goal opened a far more positive period for Southampton, but it was Walcott who should have sealed the points for Everton with 20 minutes to play.\nThe 29-year-old was played in by a delightful Gylfi Sigurdsson improvised flick, but fired horribly wide from inside the box.\nInstead it was a slightly nervy end to a game that should have been far more comfortable Everton, with Pickford punching a fierce Ward-Prowse free-kick clear of his near post as Southampton pressed for a later equaliser.\nRelive Everton v Southampton\nA good new start - and more to come?\nLast week's 2-2 draw away to Wolves already gave Everton fans a flavour of what to expect from Silva's time in charge. There was much more adventure than was observed under Sam Allardyce - even playing with 10 men against a team that is expected to be competitive in England's top flight.\nAt Goodison on Saturday, Everton once again impressed going forward, and especially impressive was Richarlison. The Brazilian was once again lively and full of tricks, linking well with those around him as Silva's side conjured seven shots on target in all.\nPerhaps most impressive however was the way in which Everton responded to Southampton dragging themselves back into contention - by continuing to attack.\nSaints had come back into the game from a distant position after Ings' goal, but the persistent quality of Everton's play going forward ultimately saw them leave the pitch as deserved winners, applauded by their fans.\nThey should have added at least a third goal, but that reaction was a world away from the previous home match here - a 1-1 draw with a Southampton side battling for survival on 5 May, when there were boos at the final whistle.\nThat result sealed an eighth-placed finish for Allardyce's team in the league. Can Everton hope for more this year?\nA clue may lie in the several high-profile signings who are yet to feature this season. Yerry Mina has a minor foot injury, Andre Gomes is still recovering from a hamstring problem and Bernard is not quite match fit - so there may well be much better still to come.\nSaints work hard but fall short\nSouthampton shared a tight opening draw at home to Burnley last week - where McCarthy produced several impressive stops.\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate was at Goodison Park on Saturday, reportedly\n, external\nto watch the 28-year-old, but there was little the keeper could have done to stop either of Everton's goals.\nInstead, the man who caught the eye for Southampton was Ings. He spent much of the afternoon chasing down lost causes, on more than one occasion managing to draw danger from a situation that seemed comfortably in Everton's control.\nIt was his hard work that earned the corner from which he scored - stretching to spill an over-hit Lemina pass back into a dangerous position and forcing Everton to turn behind. And he would have found the net in the first half were it not Pickford's stunning save.\nOn the balance of play, a draw for Southampton would have been kind. Everton were the better side, but there were still a few bright points for manager Mark Hughes to reflect on, not least the industry of his new striker, an injury-plagued 26-year-old who has only played once for England, back in 2015.\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Everton)\nRicharlison's run and Ings' jinx - the stats\nEverton are unbeaten in their past 14 home league games against Southampton (W10 D4), since a 0-2 defeat in November 1997.\nSouthampton have won just two of their past 14 Premier League games, drawing five and losing seven.\nEverton's Theo Walcott has scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time since January 2013, for Arsenal against West Ham.\nRicharlison has scored three goals in his opening two Premier League games for Everton, more than he did in his last 31 for Watford (two).\nHe is only the third player to net three goals in his first two Premier League appearance for Everton (after Romelu Lukaku in September 2013 and Brian McBride in January 2003).\nDanny Ings has scored three goals against Everton in the Premier League (in six games), more than against any other side.\nWhat the managers said\nEverton manager Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It was a good first half, we started really well but after they scored the game looked different for us.\n\"We kept going in the same way, but the second half it was a bit different, we had to manage it in a different way, and we are working hard on defending better on set pieces.\n\"But really we deserved these three points.\"\nSouthampton boss Mark Hughes speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"For the most part we did OK, I thought we had the better general play and chances created. Unfortunately we found ourselves two down.\n\"It was not a particularly poor first half and the second half we got a goal back which was important. It was a very stop-start game and the referee allowed it to be fragmented.\"\nOn goalscorer Danny Ings: \"I am delighted he is off the mark and get the momentum building. His transition to be a Saints player will be very smooth.\"\nOn a late challenge by Pickford on Ings: \"The keeper is lucky to stay on, he carries on with his boot. I am surprised the referee did not see that or it warrant any further punishment. It was a little bit like his [the referee's] performance.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Bournemouth for a 15:00 BST kick-off on Saturday, when Southampton host Leicester."

        "article_text": "Leicester 2-0 Wolves: Jamie Vardy sent off as 10-man Leicester hold on to beat Wolves\nLeicester City held on with 10 men to beat Wolves after striker Jamie Vardy was sent off - and manager Claude Puel said they were \"lucky\" to win.\nVardy, who started the game after scoring as a substitute in the Foxes' Premier League opener against Manchester United, was dismissed on 66 minutes for a reckless challenge on Matt Doherty.\nLeicester already led by two goals at that point - Doherty inadvertently setting them on their way with an own goal he knew little about as he headed home a Marc Albrighton cross which took a flick off Conor Coady.\nJames Maddison, a \u00a320m signing from Norwich, scored the second on his home debut on the stroke of half-time with a well-placed finish from the edge of the area after referee Mike Dean allowed play to continue following a foul on Ricardo Pereira.\nWolves had started the game strongly but failed to make the most of their opportunities, Joao Moutinho striking the crossbar with Kasper Schmeichel beaten and Raul Jimenez hitting the post following a sharp turn.\nAnd Nuno Espirito Santo's side, for whom club record signing Adama Traore came on at half-time, could not capitalise on their extra man after Vardy's dismissal as their wait for a first Premier League victory since February 2012 goes on.\n\"I think perhaps Wolves deserve a result,\" said Puel.\n\"Congratulations to them because they played well. They are difficult to read, they cause a lot of difficulty. It is difficult to defend against them.\n\"We were lucky. My players kept a good attitude and mentality. It was important to have the right attitude.\"\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nPlenty of positives for Puel\nLeicester began the season with an opening-day defeat at Old Trafford which, taken in isolation, should not have prompted too many questions about Puel's position.\nHowever, the Frenchman was indeed quizzed about his future this week, saying \"speculation from outside the club is not my concern\".\nAnd, with his side having won just one of their previous eight matches in the Premier League, this victory is an important one.\nPuel made four changes to his side, giving Jonny Evans his debut following a \u00a33.5m move from West Brom. A clean sheet - despite Wolves starting both halves brightly - suggests there is plenty of potential in the 30-year-old's central-defensive partnership with Harry Maguire.\nMaddison, another summer arrival, again impressed with an authoritative performance, rounded off neatly with his first goal for the club. The 21-year-old grew in confidence with each minute that passed, and his composed finish from the edge of the area showed a maturity evident throughout much of his game.\nBut the loss of England international Vardy may hurt Leicester - though they closed this game out in a professional manner, it remains to be seen how they will cope in his absence through suspension.\nImpressive Traore not enough for Wolves\nNuno's side began the season with plenty of optimism after a number of notable signings, including the \u00a318m signing of Traore from Middlesbrough.\nThe Spaniard, who began his career at Barcelona, started on the bench but was introduced at half-time as Nuno sought a way back into the match.\nThe 22-year-old, who completed 132 more dribbles than any other player in the Championship last season, showed glimpses of his ability with signature surging runs that are sure to trouble top-flight defenders.\nPrior to his introduction, Wolves had made a lively start, matching the tempo of their entertaining draw with Everton in their first Premier League match since 2012.\nSchmeichel's goal frame was battered by Moutinho and Jimenez, and Leicester's defence was stretched, but the visitors could not find the net.\nThis was a lesson in taking your chances - and though they fought back twice against 10-man Everton last weekend, they could not take full advantage of a similar situation here.\nBut Wolves looked a threat throughout and will certainly offer plenty of entertainment in the Premier League this season.\n\"We started very well but you have to be clinical,\" said former Porto boss Nuno.\n\"The way we played makes me proud but I am not happy with the result. We have to be accurate in the final moment. We could and should do better.\"\nMan of the match - James Maddison (Leicester)\nRed cards and own goals\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2014-15, Leicester players have been sent off 14 times, a haul inferior only to Newcastle in that period (15).\nSince 2015-16, no player has been shown more red cards in the Premier League than Jamie Vardy (three - also Miguel Britos, Simon Francis, Sadio Mane and Victor Wanyama).\nLeicester have benefited from four own goals in the Premier League since the start of last season, a joint-high with Tottenham.\nMaddison has been directly involved in five goals in his past six home league games (3 goals, 2 assists), as many as in the previous 24.\nLeicester have beaten Wolves in the top flight for the first time since December 1983 (5-1 at Filbert Street), drawing once and losing twice also since then.\nWolves have won just one of their eight visits to the King Power Stadium in all competitions (D3 L4), winning 4-1 in the Championship in May 2007.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester face a trip to Puel's former side Southampton next Saturday (15:00 BST), after Wolves host Premier League champions Manchester City (12:30 BST)."

I had chances today and everyone must be thinking it must be another one of those.\n\"I am not silly and I know people talk about it, but it is nice to put it to bed.\"\nSome signs of promise for Fulham\nThis London derby brought together two sides who had employed very different approaches to the summer transfer window.\nFulham spent a reported \u00a3100m\n, external\nas they brought in 12 players in an effort to give themselves the strongest chance possible of survival on their Premier League return. Tottenham did not make a single signing.\nIt was that familiarity the Spurs players had with each other that ultimately came out on top, but there were promising signs for the Cottagers.\nAfter looking like a collection of individuals for the first 20 minutes - struggling to put together a coherent spell of possession - they improved significantly as the game wore on.\nJean Michael Seri displayed excellent passing ability, most notably putting Ryan Sessegnon through with a wonderful ball over the defence, while Sessegnon himself highlighted why he is one of the most promising youngsters in England by getting in behind the Tottenham defence on a couple of occasions.\nGiven a bit more time together, Fulham fans can feel confident their team should soon start to justify the money spent to assemble it.\nMan of the match - Kieran Trippier\nSpurs put newcomers to the sword again - the stats\nTottenham have won nine of their past 10 Premier League meetings with Fulham, losing in a home match in March 2013 (0-1).\nFulham have conceded in their past 19 Premier League away games - the longest current run without a clean sheet away in the top flight (among this season's 20 teams).\nSpurs are on a run of 19 consecutive home Premier League victories against newly promoted opponents, conceding just twice in their past 10 matches.\nSessegnon has either scored or assisted each of Fulham's past four goals in all competitions (1 goal, 3 assists).\nSince his debut for Fulham in February, Mitrovic has scored 13 league goals - only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (14) has more in the top four tiers of English football in that time.\nMoura has had a hand in six goals in his seven starts since joining Tottenham (two goals, four assists).\nKane has scored 24 goals in 36 London derbies for Tottenham (0.67 goals per game). Only former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry has a better goals-per-game ratio of players to have played in 10 or more such matches (43 goals in 59 games - 0.73 goals per game).\nWhat next?\nTottenham head to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Monday, 27 August (20:00 BST kick-off, while Fulham host Burnley the previous day (16:00)."

        "article_text": "West Ham 1-2 Bournemouth: Manuel Pellegrini urges fans to 'trust' Hammers after loss\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini urged fans to \"trust\" the team after the Hammers threw away a lead and lost at home to Bournemouth - their second loss in two games this season.\nA fine individual goal from Callum Wilson and a Steve Cook header six minutes later gave Bournemouth the win after Marko Arnautovic's penalty had put the hosts ahead in the first half.\nPellegrini, who won the Premier League title with Manchester City in 2013-14, replaced former boss David Moyes in the summer after he was not given a contract extension having only finished 13th.\nWest Ham fans repeatedly protested during last season and, although there were no protests on Saturday, a large number of the 56,888 crowd at London Stadium did leave early.\nRelive West Ham v Bournemouth as it happened\n\"The fans must also trust again this season,\" said Pellegrini. \"The stadium was empty with 10 minutes to go, we can still score in that time. They need to believe but if you don't have results it is more difficult for them.\n\"The squad, everyone, must forget about last season, trust what we are doing and look to the future.\n\"I feel the squad is without trust, many have to adapt to the Premier League. We knew we had a difficult start with our fixtures but at home we must win.\"\nThe Hammers, beaten 4-0 at Liverpool last Sunday, took the lead when Arnautovic converted a penalty after Javier Hernandez had been clipped by Nathan Ake.\nBut Wilson equalised as he ran with the ball from near the halfway line and slotted past Lukasz Fabianski, before defender Cook secured a fine away win from Ryan Fraser's free-kick.\nIt means West Ham have failed to earn a point from Pellegrini's first two games in charge, while Eddie Howe's Bournemouth have two wins from two matches.\nEarly West Ham optimism vanishes\nDuring the summer Pellegrini signed nine new players, spending almost \u00a3100m in the transfer market, but his side have now played two, lost two, only scored once and have conceded six times to sit bottom of the table.\nTheir Chilean manager named an attacking line-up, with Javier Hernandez, Felipe Anderson, Arnautovic and Robert Snodgrass all in the side, but, just like last season, the Hammers' defensive frailties again showed.\nWhen it was goalless, a poor West Ham offside trap failed and that enabled Wilson to shoot at goal, but he was only denied by excellent reflexes by Fabianski, who got down quickly to save it.\nThe hosts actually took the lead a minute later with Arnautovic's well-taken penalty after Ake had slid in on Hernandez and caught his standing foot.\nHowever, West Ham were given another scare just before half-time when David Brooks again avoided the offside trap, but wasted the chance, glancing a free header wide.\nBrooks, a summer signing from Sheffield United, nearly equalised at the start of the second half but was only denied by another one-handed save by Fabianski.\nHowever, Wilson's fine individual goal and Cook's header left West Ham fans frustrated. It could still get worse for the Hammers as they have a tough run of fixtures, including matches against Arsenal, Everton, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham in five of their next seven games.\n\"The team was too nervous,\" added Pellegrini. \"We won the first half 1-0, from the bench it looked like the players wanted to finish and didn't continue playing, especially late in the first half. In the second half we conceded two easy goals, four defenders against one for the first goal.\"\nWilson brilliance helps Bournemouth win\nThere looked to be little danger when Wilson picked up the ball in the 60th minute, as he was the only Bournemouth man in the West Ham half.\nBut, with the home defence backing off, Wilson was able to run at them, avoid a half-hearted challenge from Fabian Balbuena, skip past a sliding tackle from Pablo Zabaleta and calmly slot past Fabianski.\nThat is two goals in two games for Wilson as he also scored in Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Cardiff in the opening weekend of the season.\nHis team went ahead six minutes later when Cook was too strong for his marker Angelo Ogbonna, who had needlessly given away a free-kick on the side of the penalty area with a clumsy foul on Fraser.\nWest Ham brought on Carlos Sanchez and Lucas Perez late on, with both summer signings making their debuts as the Hammers pushed for an equaliser.\nBut the hosts did not manage to create much after that moment, apart from a Jack Wilshere shot that was comfortably saved by Asmir Begovic, who also produced a fine save in the first half to deny Hernandez when it was goalless.\nBournemouth were even able to leave out club record signing Jefferson Lerma, the Colombia midfielder who they signed for \u00a325m from Levante, and did not need to bring on Jermain Defoe against the club where he started his career.\nFor the Cherries, they now have six points from two matches and it is a complete contrast to last season, when they lost their opening four league matches.\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson\nResilient Bournemouth fight back again - the stats\nThe side scoring first has only won two of the seven Premier League meetings between Bournemouth and West Ham, with the Cherries winning 4-3 in August 2015, and the Hammers 1-0 in August 2016.\nBournemouth have gained 19 points from losing positions in the Premier League in 2018; seven more than any other side.\nBournemouth have won four consecutive top-flight games for the first time in their history.\nBournemouth have won successive Premier League games in London for the first time since their first two visits to the capital in August-December 2015.\nSteve Cook both scored and assisted in a six-minute period - the first time he has been directly involved in two goals in a single league match.\nCallum Wilson has scored five goals in his five league games against West Ham; against no other side has he scored more in English league football.\nWilson has scored in three successive league games for the first time since April 2015, when the Cherries were in the Championship.\n'An excellent performance' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe told BBC Sport:\n\"It was an excellent win and an excellent performance, especially the second half. At 1-0 down, there's a lot of work to do so credit to the players.\n\"Every team is reliant on their creative players and all those for us functioned well in the second half. How we haven't scored more we will have a look back, but it is a good sign.\nOn Wilson's goal: \"We really needed it, a really good goal. He is outnumbered and showed his pace and it was a really good finish. Hopefully this is the start he needs to believe he can have a good season - we know he is capable.\"\nWhat next?\nAn away trip to Arsenal is next for West Ham, on Saturday, 25 August (15:00 BST), while Bournemouth will be playing at home to Everton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-2 Arsenal: Marcos Alonso scores late to give Chelsea victory\nMarcos Alonso's late strike settled a chaotic Premier League classic in Chelsea's favour after Arsenal fought back from two goals down and threatened to earn a point at Stamford Bridge.\nBut, despite the victory, coach Maurizio Sarri said he did not believe his players were ready to challenge for Manchester City's title.\n\"I enjoyed the match for 75 minutes,\" he said. \"The other 15 minutes it was better to smoke, I think. It was a wonderful match for everybody but those 15 minutes were horrible.\n\"At the moment we are not ready. We need to improve and I hope that, in two months' time, we will be able to play 90 minutes like we did in the first 25 today.\"\nSarri's side had built a two-goal advantage inside the first 20 minutes as Pedro turned in Alonso's cross and Alvaro Morata added another seconds after Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shot over from close range.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan wasted a similar opportunity before pulling one back with a low shot that Chelsea's new \u00a371m keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga should have saved, before Alex Iwobi put the Gunners on level terms.\nAubameyang and Iwobi missed further chances before half-time and Chelsea controlled the second half, Alonso sweeping in substitute Eden Hazard's cross nine minutes from time to make it successive wins for Sarri and two defeats for new Arsenal manager Unai Emery.\nAnalysis - thrilling match shows up limitations\nHow you rated the players\nAstute buys and struggling sides - Premier League talking points\nRelive Chelsea v Arsenal\nSarri and Emery cut contrasting figures\nThis was a heavyweight Premier League meeting for newcomers Sarri and Emery - and they were provided with plenty of food for thought after an engrossing 90 minutes.\nEmery is perpetual motion in his technical area, pacing constantly from almost the first minute, a blur of gesticulations and dramatic effect with cajoling and encouragement throughout.\nThe Spaniard is still trying to put his imprint on this Arsenal team after the end of Arsene Wenger's 22-year reign, and he is very obviously a hands-on figure.\nIt is also clear from the manner in which Arsenal got back into the game - even though they ended defeated - that his new players are fighting for their manager.\nSarri, dressed casually in a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, was far less animated but was still keen to get his message across and it is already clear he is determined to repeat the brand of attacking play that made his reputation.\nThese two men will add plenty of character and colour to the Premier League's A-list cast of managers - and both will have much to keep them occupied.\nDefensive chaos cause for concern\nThis was both chaotic and a classic, especially in a first half that brought four goals and some early contenders for misses of the season from Arsenal.\nWhat will have concerned Sarri, even after a win that makes it maximum points from two games, is the ease with which Arsenal were able to cut his defence apart on so many occasions in the first half.\nSarri loves his teams to be on the front foot but Arsenal could easily have scored five, perhaps six, goals in the first 45 minutes - happily for him he has quality in attack at his disposal that enabled Chelsea to come through this test.\nAs for Emery, his style of a high defensive line and playing out from the back is a work in progress but both Sokratis and Shkodran Mustafi are alarmingly short of pace for such an approach and this needs to be addressed.\nIt all made for gloriously entertaining fare - but with causes for concern for both Sarri and Emery.\nWhat can Sarri and Emery take away?\nSarri can be a satisfied man with a second successive victory, one achieved when he is still easing Hazard back to full throttle via the substitutes' bench.\nHe will need to cure those defensive ills but Chelsea have class in other areas, with Jorginho a quality addition and Pedro and Morata chipping in with goals.\nEmery looked devastated at the final whistle and, of course, no points from his first two (admittedly very tough) games is hardly a flying start.\nYet there were things to encourage him.\nTeenager Matteo Guendouzi looks a real prospect and Emery will be delighted by his team's resolve after they went two goals behind to work their way back into the game.\nThis was never going to be a quick fix, the fixture list has been cruel - and on another day Mkhitaryan and Aubameyang will put those chances away.\nEmery will hope to get off the mark at home to West Ham United, who have also started with successive defeats.\nMan of the match - Jorginho (Chelsea)\nEmery's losing start - the stats\nChelsea have won six of their past seven home league games against Arsenal, the exception being a 0-0 draw last season.\nArsenal scored two goals against Chelsea, as many as on their previous six Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge.\nUnai Emery is the first Arsenal manager to lose his first two games in charge since Steve Burtenshaw, who lost his first three in charge as caretaker in March/April 1986.\nMarcos Alonso has been directly involved in 20 Premier League goals since his Chelsea debut in September 2016 (14 goals, six assists); seven more than any other defender.\nNo player has assisted a single team-mate more often in the Premier League since the start of last season than Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta for Alvaro Morata (7, level with Riyad Mahrez for Jamie Vardy with Leicester).\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan has been directly involved in eight goals in his 13 Premier League games for Arsenal (3 goals, 5 assists), one more than in his last 25 for Manchester United (7).\nEden Hazard registered his 41st assist for Chelsea, level with Cesc Fabregas for the Blues, and behind only Frank Lampard (90), Didier Drogba (55), and Gianfranco Zola (42).\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC Sport: \"In this period for us it's not easy to gain points. Three points is an important target for us. We did very well for 75 minutes but, inside that, 15 minutes were horrible.\n\"It was very, very difficult because we lost the distances between the players and we were unable to cover the lost balls and press like a team, so we were really in trouble. But I think the players were really very good because at 2-2 it was not easy with Arsenal.\n\"In the second half we did very well mentally also.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is clear the result is not good for us but the process is continuing. Today, one thing in the first half is the reaction after 2-0, and also the efficiency. We had chances to more score in the first half.\n\"I think we need to control the second half like we want, but we didn't play like the first half and our chances were less.\n\"We need to continue working for what we want, our process. Today we had two midfielders - one 19 and one 21 years old. We need to give them the confidence to play but our way, our process, is to improve and give these chances to the young players. I think today will prepare us well for the next matches.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea are away to Newcastle next Sunday in a 16:00 BST kick-off, while Arsenal are at home to West Ham on Saturday at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-3 Watford: Andre Gray scores on Burnley return as Watford end away goal drought\nAndre Gray struck on his return to Burnley as Watford scored an away goal for the first time since January to continue their winning start to the Premier League season.\nGray, who left Turf Moor to join the Hornets in August 2017, produced a brilliant volley from Troy Deeney's cross in the first three minutes - their first goal on their travels since Javi Gracia was appointed head coach.\nBurnley, who beat Istanbul Basaksehir in their Europa League third qualifying round tie on Thursday, equalised just three minutes later as James Tarkowski headed his first goal for the club.\nBut Watford scored twice in the opening six minutes of the second half to secure victory - captain Deeney hitting his first goal since March by latching on to Abdoulaye Doucoure's perfectly weighted pass and Will Hughes firing home the third when he collected Burnley defender Matt Lowton's loose pass and drove home from outside the area.\nWith 20 minutes remaining, Sam Vokes almost scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute for Burnley, heading narrowly wide as Ben Foster scrambled to his bottom corner.\nHowever visitors Watford, who defeated Brighton 2-0 last weekend, finished the superior side as their opponents - playing their sixth competitive match in 25 days - failed to find a route back into the match.\nWatford set about amending shocking away record\nWatford's comfortable victory over Brighton temporarily silenced questions over how they might cope after losing Richarlison to Everton for \u00a350m in July.\nGracia's men have endured startling struggles away from home recently, failing to record a win in 12 top-flight trips before today, losing 11 of those and failing to score in their past eight on the road.\nBut Deeney remained adamant following victory last week that suggestions his team were set to \"fall apart\" following their summer business were unfair.\nAnd fielding a line-up unchanged from the Brighton game, Watford set about amending their away statistics on Sunday.\nIt was Argentine Roberto Pereyra who stepped up to fill the Brazilian's boots with two goals for the Hornets last time out, but it was Gray who supplied the early heroics against his former side, demonstrating his clinical ability in front of goal with a brilliant volley beyond Joe Hart.\nDeeney proved a constant nuisance for the Burnley backline and his perseverance ultimately culminated in his long-awaited return to the scoresheet.\nThe Hornets showed a real togetherness, characterised by Gray and Deeney's effective link-up play, that will see them prove difficult opposition in the league this term, and Hughes' excellent strike capped off a pleasing performance for Gracia.\nBurnley's European balancing act\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche reverted to the 11 that started last Sunday's 0-0 Premier League opener at Southampton, having made seven changes for Thursday's Europa League match.\nThe obvious issue for Dyche at the beginning of the campaign was how to balance a relatively thin squad, ensuring their European exploits - however long they continue - detract as little as possible from their Premier League efforts after achieving seventh spot last term.\nHowever, they were caught out by Watford's blistering start in both halves and, though Dyche will have been pleased by Burnley's ability to respond immediately to the opening goal, their start to the second half will have been hugely frustrating.\nOnly three players who completed the whole 120 minutes in midweek - Hart, Jeff Hendrick and Stephen Ward - started again on Sunday, but Watford looked the sharper side and dominated the second half as Burnley began to run out of ideas.\nIt means Dyche's team have not won any of their past seven Premier League matches, losing four - a run stretching back to April.\nThey do have faces yet to feature, including summer addition Matej Vydra who is not yet match fit - and will need them, given that there is no let-up in the immediate fixture list. The task of defeating Olympiakos over two legs in the Europa League play-off starts with a trip to Greece on Thursday.\nMan of the match - Troy Deeney (Watford)\n'We gave the game away' - what they said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia: \"Today we scored three and we have done better than last season. But I don't like to look back at the statistics of last season; I prefer to enjoy the moment. We did a good job and I'm very happy for the players.\n\"It is important the amount of goals but the quality as well. Today the strikers Troy Deeney and Andre Gray scored which is very important for them and the team. Will Hughes scored an outstanding goal. I am happy for all of them.\n\"All the players are working a lot. Troy for example has a brilliant attitude in every training session and we will try to keep that in the next games.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We gave the game away. In the very beginning we were not very sharp - their first shot on target goes in. We responded very well, had a good first half and a number of chances we should have made more of.\n\"The players had a warning to start the second half right and we didn't. The only gripe is that you can understand if we didn't start well but the players had that warning before the second half.\"\nHornets' flying start - the stats\nWatford have won their opening two matches in a top-flight league season for only the second time. On the previous occasion (1982-83), they finished second, behind Liverpool.\nGray's opening goal ended a run of 730 minutes without a Premier League away goal for Watford. Indeed, Gray was the last Hornets' player to score on the road in the competition before today; at Manchester City on 2 January.\nWatford's opening goal, coming after two minutes 40 seconds, was their quickest in a Premier League away match.\nHughes has ended on the winning side in each of the past 13 competitive games he has scored in.\nSince regaining promotion to the Premier League in 2016, this is only the second time that Burnley have conceded three or more goals in a home match (having lost 0-3 at home to Tottenham Hotspur in December 2017).\nTarkowski's goal was his first for Burnley in all competitions, in what was his 67th appearance for the club.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Greece for the first leg of their Europa League qualifier against Olympiakos on Thursday (19:00 BST) before a trip to Fulham next Sunday (16:00 BST). Watford host Crystal Palace earlier that day (13:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Man City 6-1 Huddersfield: Sergio Aguero hat-trick as champions go top\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola said Sergio Aguero is in the best condition he has seen him in, after the striker scored a superb hat-trick in a thumping win over Huddersfield.\nAguero opened the scoring in the first half before adding two goals after the break to complete his 13th career hat-trick and ninth in the Premier League. Only Alan Shearer, with 11, has scored more in the competition.\n\"I never saw him like this since I was here,\" Guardiola said.\n\"He is in an incredible condition with the ball and without the ball.\"\nThe defending champions, who beat Arsenal 2-0 in their opening match, lost only once at home in 2017-18, and victory never looked in doubt against a Huddersfield team who have now been beaten in their first two games.\nThe Terriers did manage to hold City at bay for 25 minutes but were undone when goalkeeper Ederson picked out Aguero with a pinpoint pass and the striker drew out Ben Hamer before lifting the ball into the net.\nGabriel Jesus added a second seven minutes later with a crisp low strike from the edge of the area, before Aguero pounced on a Hamer error to stab in his second.\nJon Gorenc Stankovic gave the visitors the slightest glimmer of hope before half-time when he poked in from Steve Mounie's flick-on, but any optimism was snuffed out early in the second half by a brilliant free-kick from David Silva.\nAguero wrapped up his hat-trick with a smart flick from Benjamin Mendy's cross - before a Terence Kongolo own goal sealed an emphatic win for an impressive City.\nGuardiola's side are top of the table and have scored eight goals in two games, conceding just one. Huddersfield, meanwhile, drop to the bottom on goal difference.\n\"We started better than last season,\" said Guardiola. \"We made a good performance in 90 minutes.\n\"Last season, Huddersfield played five at the back. We decided today we would play with two strikers.\"\nRead: David Silva's baby steals show as City mascot\nWatch: Is David Silva Man City's best player?\nRelive City's emphatic win - plus Sunday's other Premier League football\nGuardiola's experiment a worry for his rivals\nHow do you stop a team like Manchester City? That was a question posed to the 19 other Premier League clubs last season, with many opting for the tactic of 'parking the bus'.\nCity usually managed to find a way through, but sometimes not until very late on - winning goals against Huddersfield, Southampton, Bournemouth and West Ham last term did not come until after the 80th minute.\nThat has perhaps prompted Guardiola to find an alternative tactic to deal with defensive sides, as BBC Radio 5 live pundit Leon Osman observed during Sunday's game.\n\"Pep Guardiola has made a number of changes and left out Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling and Kyle Walker,\" said the former Everton midfielder.\n\"He's taken out all the guys with pace and got his footballers on. Guys with quick feet that can operate in small spaces.\"\nThe result was Huddersfield could barely get the ball off their hosts as City skilfully crafted opportunities from the limited space they had.\nEven at 6-1, City did not ease up their attacking intent. In truth, Huddersfield can consider themselves fortunate that a repeat of the 10-1 defeat they suffered at City 31 years ago did not materialise.\nGuardiola will surely have been happy with what he saw. Usually so tense on the touchline, he was seen sharing a joke with coach Mikel Arteta towards the end of the game.\nHis side now have a couple of ways they can successfully approach a game - an ominous sign for the rest of the Premier League.\nHamer errors hinder Huddersfield\nIt was always going to be a tough ask for Huddersfield to get anything against a fresh and hungry City side, but their cause was not helped by some questionable goalkeeping by Hamer.\nDane Jonas Lossl was first choice last term but missed a large amount of pre-season because of his World Cup commitments, while Hamer, signed from Leicester in the summer, impressed in friendlies.\nTerriers boss David Wagner rewarded Hamer by starting him against Chelsea last weekend. He conceded three goals in that game but was given another opportunity to impress against City.\nHe did not take it. Hamer committed himself to coming way off his line to try todeny Aguero the opener - but could only watch as the Argentina striker lifted the ball out of his reach.\nHe was then beaten at his near post for City's second, before spilling a fairly routine save from a cross to allow Aguero to tap in the third.\nHuddersfield do not score often - Stankovic's strike was only their sixth in the past 14 games - so they cannot afford to make too many mistakes.\n\"We faced a City side absolutely on it,\" said Wagner. \"They were different class and we were second best and that is why we conceded this defeat.\n\"We hoped for more out of the last two games but we didn't expect more. This means nothing more than we get these two games out of our head now and focus on the next one.\"\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\nA Premier League first - the stats\nHuddersfield have conceded nine goals in their first two matches this season. Only one side in Premier League history has conceded more goals in their opening two games - Wigan Athletic in 2010-11 (10).\nManchester City have now scored 104 goals in 39 games at home under Pep Guardiola in the Premier League.\nWith his assist for Aguero's opening goal, Ederson became the first goalkeeper to set up a Premier League goal for Manchester City.\nAguero has scored 14 goals in his past eight league appearances for Manchester City at the Etihad.\nStankovic is just the second player from Slovenia to score a Premier League goal after ex-West Bromwich Albion and Hull City midfielder Robert Koren.\nAguero now has nine Premier League hat-tricks (level with former Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester City striker Robbie Fowler). Only ex-Blackburn and Newcastle forward Alan Shearer (11) has managed more.\nThe Argentine has equalled Shearer's record of trebles for one Premier League club. The ex-England captain scored nine for Blackburn Rovers.\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to newly promoted Wolves on Saturday, 25 August (12:30 BST), while Huddersfield are at home to Cardiff at 15:00 on the same day."

        "article_text": "Brighton 3-2 Man Utd: Brighton score three first-half goals to stun visitors\nManchester United did not show the right attitude in their surprise Premier League defeat at Brighton, says captain Paul Pogba.\nThe Seagulls, who beat Jose Mourinho's side at the Amex Stadium in May to retain their top-flight status, stunned their visitors by scoring three goals in the first half.\nGlenn Murray flicked in the opener before Shane Duffy stroked home two minutes later.\nRomelu Lukaku halved the deficit 11 minutes before the break, rising unmarked to nod in Luke Shaw's ball, but Pascal Gross converted a penalty after a foul by Eric Bailly.\nPogba also scored from the spot - deep in second-half stoppage time - but it was not enough to deny Brighton a famous win.\n\"The attitude that we had was not like we wanted to beat them. They had more anger than us and that showed on the pitch,\" Pogba told Sky Sports.\n\"I put myself first. My attitude wasn't right enough. We'll keep trying and keep pushing and obviously it's a lesson for us.\"\nMourinho said he would not blame individuals, despite admitting his side made \"incredible mistakes\".\nThe Portuguese has previously singled out players for criticism if he felt they performed below expectations but said his side were not good enough as a collective against Brighton.\n\"We were punished by the mistakes we made,\" he said. \"For me that's the story of the game.\n\"We made incredible mistakes in some crucial moments. Mistakes that killed us.\"\nMourinho's fears come to fruition\nMourinho warned in the summer that his side faced \"a difficult season\"\n, external\nif they did not strengthen before the transfer window closed.\nHe had highlighted his team's defence as an area that needed bolstering, but deadline day passed without any new arrivals.\nMourinho's concerns were laid bare here, with his defence caught out on a number of occasions by Brighton's quick movement.\nBailly, in particular, struggled. Aside from giving away the penalty he also miscontrolled a pass in the second half that momentarily put March through before the Ivorian was able to recover.\nBailly and centre-back partner Victor Lindelof - both Mourinho signings - have now been a part of a defence that has conceded four goals in the first two games of the season. It took United nine to let in that many last season.\nFortress Amex as intimidating as ever\nBrighton's home form played a huge part in their survival last season, with 29 of their 40 points secured at the Amex Stadium.\nOnce again, it looks like a trip to the south coast will be a difficult one for their Premier League rivals.\nUnited may have been well below par but that should not take away from what was a controlled and confident display by the Seagulls against a side that finished second last season.\nThey took the game to their opponents from the outset, March working the defence with an early cross, and even the loss of influential defender Lewis Dunk did not disrupt them as Anthony Knockaert got in behind before putting his shot just wide.\nBrighton did not have a shot after the break, but they did not need to as they changed tack from attack to containment. In the end it was a comfortable afternoon for Chris Hughton's side.\n\"I thought we were very good. It was a victory we deserved,\" said Hughton.\n\"There's not a player that didn't play well. To get that result with the quality they have you have to put in a good performance.\"\nMartial fails to take his chance\nAlexis Sanchez was a surprise absentee from United's starting XI, with Mourinho confirming before kick-off that the forward was injured.\nThat meant Anthony Martial, who has been linked with a move, was handed the chance to impress.\nMourinho was critical of Martial for his performance here in May, and another ineffective display will surely not have impressed his manager.\nMartial lasted until the hour mark before he was substituted with neither he nor Mourinho appearing to acknowledge each other as he went down the tunnel.\nMan of the match - Solly March\nA first for Paul Pogba - the stats\nSince taking charge of United at the start of the 2016-17 season, the only opponent Mourinho has lost against more often than Brighton (two) is his former club Chelsea (four).\nBrighton have lost just one of their past eight home games in the Premier League (W5 D2 L1), with the two most recent both being wins against United (1-0 in 2017-18 and 3-1 in 2018-19).\nUnited lost their first away game of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 2012-13, when they were beaten 1-0 by Everton.\nTwenty three of Murray's 24 goals in the Premier League have been scored from inside the box, including 100% of those scored for Brighton in the competition (13/13).\nGross has scored eight goals in the Premier League, with all eight at home. Only two players have netted more goals exclusively at home in the competition's history - Georginio Wijnaldum (18) and Clive Wilson (nine).\nIn competitive games since the start of the 2018 World Cup, David de Gea has conceded 10 goals from the past 14 shots on target he has faced.\nLukaku has scored against 18 of the current 20 Premier League teams, with Cardiff and Wolves the only teams he is yet to find the net against.\nPogba ended on the losing side in a Premier League game he scored in for the first time - prior to today, United had won each of the previous 11 games he had netted in, which was a joint-record in the competition (with Ryan Babel for Liverpool).\nThis was only the 10th time in Premier League history that United conceded three first-half goals in a game, and the first time since October 2015 against Arsenal.\nWhat next?\nBrighton travel to Liverpool on Saturday, 25 August (17:30 BST) while United host Tottenham on Monday, 27 August (20:00 BST)"

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-2 Liverpool: James Milner and Sadio Mane score as Reds move to six points\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he was \"not interested in sending a statement\" to his side's title rivals after victory over Crystal Palace gave them a second successive Premier League win.\nThe Reds - who finished 25 points behind champions Manchester City in fourth last season - were worthy winners at Selhurst Park and join five other teams, including City, on six points after two games.\nJames Milner gave them the lead with a penalty after Mohamed Salah was brought down by Mamadou Sakho in the closing seconds of the first half.\nPalace had young defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka sent off with 15 minutes left after he brought down Salah when the Egyptian was through on goal.\nAnd Sadio Mane wrapped up the points in injury time when he ran from his own half before rounding Wayne Hennessey to score.\nThe Eagles had chances, and Andros Townsend curled an effort on to the bar after a mistake by the otherwise impressive Naby Keita.\n\"It's very early,\" said Klopp, when asked whether the result confirmed Liverpool's pre-season status as Manchester City's closest title rivals. \"I couldn't care less really. We are not in a race with other Premier League teams each weekend.\n\"It is too strong to say anything after two match days. You can discuss whatever you want - just do it without us.\"\nReaction to Liverpool's win at Selhurst Park\nReds keeper Karius set to join Besiktas\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nHodgson 'angered' - but were big decisions right?\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson was furious with the penalty decision - but accepted Wan-Bissaka's red card.\nFor the penalty, former Liverpool defender Sakho put his arms on Salah and then twice appeared to attempt to trip the forward, who went down.\n\"We probably did enough to get a result,\" Hodgson told BBC Sport. \"I don't think it was a penalty. I'm angered that a good result was taken from us.\"\nBut BBC Radio 5 live's co-commentator at Selhurst Park, Chris Sutton, felt it was a penalty. \"There was enough contact,\" he said. \"I can understand Palace fans are frustrated but it's bad defending.\"\nThe Premier League is the only one of Europe's top five leagues not to use video assistant referees this season - but even if a VAR official or referee Michael Oliver had the option of watching it again, it may not have been overturned.\nThe same was true when Wan-Bissaka clipped Salah before he could reach the penalty area. The Egyptian had possibly lost control before the tackle came, and some fans were not convinced about the decision, but Sutton said the referee had \"no choice\".\nHodgson agreed. \"Wan-Bissaka catches him,\" he said. \"I don't think he tried to pull him down but there was contact and he pulled him down. It was the right decision. He was the last man and did his best to rescue the situation. In another game he might have got a toe on the ball. I don't blame him at all.\"\nLiverpool find resolve as Klopp warns: 'Run or I'll kill you!'\nLiverpool are being widely tipped to sustain a title challenge this season but they were never likely to follow up their 4-0 opening-day win over West Ham with a similar result at Selhurst Park against a team in good form.\nBut they dominated, having more possession than the Eagles, who were on the back foot for most of the game.\nSalah, who scored 44 goals last season and once on the opening day, did not look at full sharpness - but he was still involved in all of Liverpool's best moments.\nThe Egyptian was fouled for the penalty and the red card, had a couple of shots blocked and missed with two chips over Hennessey.\nAnd he also set up Mane's late goal after Palace committed players forward for a corner, Salah playing the ball to his Senegalese team-mate, who ran 50 yards before going around the keeper to tap into an empty net.\n\"In these moments the fuel is really low and maybe the players need a bit of help from an angry manager - 'run or I will kill you' - and they did that with a fantastic counter-attack,\" said Klopp, asked about his tense demeanour in the final few minutes.\nPalace's unbeaten run comes to an end\nThe Eagles, who were unbeaten in seven Premier League games going back to a 2-1 defeat by Liverpool on 31 March, worked hard and had chances but were second best against talented opposition.\nTheir biggest chance came when Townsend got the ball outside the box and sent a brilliant effort on to the crossbar, with Alisson beaten.\nLuka Milivojevic also went close with a free-kick, and Wilfried Zaha, who signed a new five-year deal this week, had a low shot saved in the second half.\nChristian Benteke never looked like adding to his two goals in 2018, with one shot from 20 yards flying wildly off towards the corner flag.\nFull-back Wan-Bissaka played well and was involved in a good duel with Mane on Palace's left-hand side - and he was applauded off the pitch by home fans after denying Salah a chance to score with his red-card tackle.\nHodgson brought on summer signing Max Meyer for a late debut, but the German was not able to have an impact.\n\"I thought we pushed them very hard,\" said Hodgson. \"We should have come in at 0-0 at half-time and the second half would have been even tougher. We gave them enough problems and we can consider ourselves unlucky to lose 2-0.\n\"I'm more interested in the fact we played really well [than talking about the referee].\"\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\n\"I don't know a lot of centre-backs in the world who can deal with Christian Benteke like Van Dijk did,\" said Klopp after the game.\nStats - Mane scores against Eagles again\nMane has scored six goals in his eight Premier League appearances against Palace, more than he has against any other side.\nLiverpool won their 34th Premier League game played on a Monday - only Man Utd (43) and Arsenal (36) have more victories.\nThe Reds have lost only one of their past 10 Premier League games, winning six and drawing three.\nPalace have won just two of their previous 20 Premier League games played against 'big six' sides at Selhurst Park (D2 L16).\nHodgson suffered his 100th defeat in the Premier League as a manager (W87 D65).\nWan-Bissaka is the youngest Palace player to be shown a red card in the Premier League (20 years, 267 days).\nMilner extended his record for the most Premier League games scored in without losing any of them (48 games: W38 D10).\nHe has scored 13 of the 15 penalties that he has taken in the Premier League, including nine of his 10 for Liverpool in the competition. Milner is the first player to score eight consecutive Premier League goals from penalties.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host Brighton on Saturday (17:30 BST), a day before Palace are at Watford (13:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-1 Man City: Aymeric Laporte rescues Molineux draw for champions\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo said his side have \"nothing to prove\" after they held Manchester City to a draw at Molineux, with Aymeric Laporte's header rescuing a point for the champions.\nPep Guardiola's side came here on the back of convincing victories at Arsenal and at home to Huddersfield Town - but were given a severe test by the team who won the Championship last season.\nIn an eventful match, City hit the woodwork twice in the first half - first, through Sergio Aguero, and then when Wolves keeper Rui Patricio brilliantly turned Raheem Sterling's rising 25-yard drive onto the bar. Wolves striker Raul Jimenez also had a goal ruled out for offside.\nThe hosts took the lead in controversial fashion after 57 minutes when defender Willy Boly's attempted diving header went in off his hand from Joao Moutinho's free-kick.\nCity had appeals for a penalty turned away by referee Martin Atkinson after Ruben Neves' challenge on David Silva, but drew level in the 69th minute when Aymeric Laporte scored his first goal for the club - a towering header from Ilkay Gundogan's free-kick.\nBoth sides had opportunities to win it in the closing stages, with City almost snatching three points when Aguero's free-kick glanced off the bar with virtually the last kick of the game.\nWolves became only the third team since the beginning of last season to reach double figures in attempts on goal against Manchester City.\n\"It is a big victory for the boys today,\" Nuno told BBC Sport. \"No matter what opponent you have you should play the way you think you should play.\n\"It is our way. We don't have to prove nothing to nobody. We just have to be ourselves, the way we work together.\"\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nSaturday's best stats\nEverything you need to know about Champions League group-stage draw\nWolves at home at the top table\nThe thunderous roar that greeted the final whistle and this well-earned point was just the sort of moment Wolves' Chinese owners had in mind when they embarked on this hugely ambitious Molineux project.\n\"We're on our way back\" boomed from the Sir Jack Hayward Stand as manager Nuno Espirito Santo and his players took the acclaim for taking the first points off Manchester City this season.\nIt has been a difficult opening to the season for Wolves with defeat at Leicester City following a home draw against Everton on the opening weekend.\nOn Saturday, however, Wolves showed commitment, energy and quality to carry out Nuno's gameplan - one which he said he would not downgrade or tailor simply because Guardiola's champions were in town.\nYes, there were moments when the hosts carried their luck. Boly's goal was clearly scored with the aid of his hand, while City were frustrated by the woodwork - once via a brilliant Patricio save - but few would begrudge them this point.\nBacked by a fervent support at a packed Molineux, they were not hanging on for a point and twice the raw pace of substitute Adama Traore almost provided crosses that led to a late goal.\nMake no mistake, City did not deserve to lose either - but this is a result, occasion and performance that will do wonders for Wolves' self-belief and help them settle into life in the Premier League.\nMan City lack usual cutting edge\nGuardiola and his Manchester City players will be frustrated at dropping their first points of the season after two convincing wins.\nWhile City saw plenty of the ball, they were just short of their dazzling best in all areas of the pitch and could not find the clinical end product that normally comes so naturally to them.\nTheir luck was also out. Aguero hit the woodwork twice and Patricio's athleticism left Sterling holding his head in anguish.\nCity still showed resilience to fight their way back into contention after the shock of falling behind to Boly's goal, and plenty of City's title rivals will have looked on in envy at the sheer firepower Guardiola was able to introduce from the bench as they went in search of victory.\nGabriel Jesus, Leroy Sane and Riyad Mahrez all came on - it did not do the trick on this occasion but their presence demonstrates the sheer size of the task of those hoping to wrestle the crown away from City.\nTough day for officials\nThe video assistant referee (VAR) will not be present in the Premier League this season - and Manchester City may well have been left regretting its absence at Molineux on Saturday.\nBoly's final touch on to Moutinho's free-kick to give Wolves the lead clearly came off his hand, but it was incredibly tough for referee Atkinson and his assistant to spot as the ball was delivered into a crowd in the penalty area.\nAnd City also felt they were denied a penalty when Silva tumbled under a Neves challenge, but their appeals were ignored.\nIn the end a draw was accepted by both sides - but City clearly felt aggrieved that big decisions had gone against them.\nMan of the match - Joao Moutinho (Wolves)\n'A very good point' - Guardiola\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was a good performance overall in all moments of the game and in all circumstances of the game, when we had the ball and when we didn't have the ball.\n\"You have to be cautious and realise your opponents are the best team, the champions, stick together, reduce the spaces and have balance.\n\"When we had the ball we created chances and played good football. It was a good game.\n\"But - and there is always a but - maybe we should have managed those couple of minutes better after we scored. There were a couple of first passes that put Manchester City in control of the game but it is one more game, one more tool to work on.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a very good point. We created chances but their keeper made saves, so today we draw. We knew how good they were this season. No complaints.\n\"We created a lot, that's why it's good. In the first half, Aguero hit the post - sometimes it goes in, sometimes not.\n\"We were not solid defensively today, that is why we conceded a few chances to them. But in general, the game - considering the quality of the opponent - was good. We have to give credit.\"\nThe stats - French flourish in English top flight\nWolves have lost just two of their 28 home games under Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, winning 18 and drawing eight.\nManchester City have lost only one of their past 30 Premier League games against newly promoted teams.\nCity conceded the opening goal in a league game for the first time in 18 games, when they lost 4-3 to Liverpool on 14 January.\nCity captain Vincent Kompany became the first Belgian to make 250 Premier League appearances.\nWolves defender Willy Boly and Manchester City's Aymetic Laporte became the 117th and 118th French players to score in the Premier League (excluding own-goals).\nIn fact, Laporte's goal was the 1,500th scored by a French player in the Premier League - with only English players scoring more.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao Cup second round on Tuesday (19:45 BST kick-off) before visiting West Ham in the Premier League next Saturday.\nManchester City host Newcastle in the league next Saturday at 17:30."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-2 Everton: Cherries fight back to draw\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe praised the \"mental strength\" of his team as they recovered from two goals behind to draw against Everton and move into the Premier League's top four.\nIn a compelling contest, in which both sides were reduced to 10 men, goals from Theo Walcott and Michael Keane - who was later taken to hospital following a stoppage-time collision with team-mate Idrissa Gueye - had put the visitors in charge.\nHowever, the Cherries underlined their reputation as escapologists with Joshua King driving home a penalty and Nathan Ake tapping in an equaliser four minutes later.\nHowe's team have now amassed 25 points from losing positions since the beginning of last season, more than any other Premier League club.\n\"We're delighted to achieve it because - at 2-0 down and 10 v 10 - it looked very difficult from the mental perspective of how the game had gone for us,\" Howe said.\n\"The players went again and once we got the goal to go 2-1, the whole game changed, the momentum of the game changed, and we were the stronger team at the end. Our frustration is that we allowed ourselves to get in that position.\"\nWalcott had raced clear to deliver the opening goal for Marco Silva's team with an angled drive, having already seen Richarlison sent off for an attempted headbutt on Adam Smith.\nKeane then doubled their advantage, heading in from a corner, five minutes after Smith was dismissed for pulling Walcott back as he advanced on goal.\nBut King's penalty, awarded for a foul by Leighton Baines on Callum Wilson, kick-started the comeback.\nAnd Bournemouth maintained their unbeaten start to the campaign when Ake followed up Wilson's header to prod in from close range.\nEverton also remain unbeaten, but Silva stressed that Keane, who was treated on the pitch for several minutes before being carried off, was \"first and most important\" in his thoughts.\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nSaturday's best stats\nCherries and Wilson show resolve\nThe Cherries were aiming for their third consecutive victory at the start of a season for the first time since 2009 - when they were in League Two.\nThey had only achieved that feat six times in their history and never in the top two tiers of English football.\nBut while victories against Cardiff and West Ham were underpinned by fluent football, this draw was a show of resolve.\nHaving surrendered the advantage of an extra player and fallen two goals behind, Howe's team found the resilience to respond after being wasteful in front of goal.\nWilson, who scored in Bournemouth's opening two fixtures, epitomised their showing.\nTwice the 26-year-old missed excellent chances - firing a first-half effort over and delaying his shot to allow Jordan Pickford to save in the second period. However, he continued to apply himself.\nOnly Dan Gosling (12.6km) covered more ground for the hosts and Wilson was rewarded by winning a penalty and then contributing to the equalising goal.\nRicharlison dominates headlines again\nEverton's summer has been dominated by their purchase of 21-year-old forward Richarlison from Watford, in a deal that could eventually rise to a club record \u00a350m fee.\nThe Brazilian has hit the ground running on Merseyside, scoring three times in the Blues' opening two fixtures.\nBut his 41st-minute dismissal meant he was unable to eclipse former Everton forwards Romelu Lukaku (2013-14) and Tony Cottee (1988-89), who both managed four goals in their first three games for the club.\nHis clash with Smith showed a lack of maturity, and with his sending-off constituting violent conduct, a three-match suspension will rule him out of home league matches against Huddersfield and West Ham, as well as the trip to Arsenal.\n\"It's something that Richarlison and the other players in our squad cannot do and something I don't like to see,\" said Silva.\n\"If you are 18, 19, 20, if you are 33 - you have to keep always your emotional balance there. Keep your mentality as well, if somebody provokes you, or not, if the fans are against you, or not.\"\nMan of the match - Theo Walcott (Everton)\nThe stats - Everton top the red-card list\nPremier League matches between Everton and Bournemouth have seen 4.14 goals on average (29 goals in seven games) - the highest average for a Premier League fixture played on more than six occasions.\nSince the start of 2017-18 season, Bournemouth have won a league-high 25 points from losing positions in the Premier League.\nTheo Walcott has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time as an Everton player and the first time since April 2017 overall.\nMichael Keane scored his first Premier League goal for Everton, in what was his 33rd appearance in the competition for the Toffees.\nJoshua King has been directly involved in 38 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (31 goals, seven assists), 14 more than any other player.\nLee Probert gave as many red cards in this match alone (2) as he did in his 18 matches as a Premier League referee in 2016-17 and 2017-18 combined.\nRicharlison's red card was the 91st that Everton have been given in Premier League history - more than any other team in the competition.\nBournemouth have seen 10 opposition players sent off against them in the Premier League. Since their first match in the competition in August 2015, only Arsenal and West Ham United (both 11) have seen more red cards for their opponents.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth face MK Dons in the EFL Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST) before travelling to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday 1 September (15:00).\nEverton host Rotherham in the EFL Cup on Wednesday (19:45) and then welcome Huddersfield to Goodison Park in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00)."

One was much more clever than the other and unfortunately the clever one was not my player.\"\nAfter Hogg had been dismissed for thrusting his forehead toward Arter, his team came under heavy pressure.\nBluebirds captain Sean Morrison headed into the hoardings from six yards before substitute Bobby Reid's glancing effort drifted narrowly wide as the breakthrough refused to arrive for the visitors.\nLaurent Depoitre could have stolen all three points at the end for Huddersfield, however, with Sol Bamba doing just enough to deny the Belgian a clear sight of goal at the end of a swift counter-attack.\nBoth sets of players slumped to the turf at the final whistle, exhausted and frustrated at failing to take three points against opposition who may well be rivals in the fight against relegation come May.\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nSaturday's best stats\nGoing the whole Hogg\nHuddersfield had 72% possession before Hogg's sending-off and just 30% in the wake of his red card.\nIt was the pivotal point in the game, with the midfielder needlessly putting himself at the mercy of referee Michael Oliver's discretion.\nThe Terriers' captain's tussle with Arter at a corner seemed initially innocuous, with Cardiff's on-loan Bournemouth midfielder appealing half-heartedly for a penalty as they jostled for position.\nBut Hogg reacted angrily as Arter regained his feet after the corner had been cleared and, as the pair exchanged words, pushed him back to the floor with a combination of a headbutt and a shove.\nAfter picking up nine yellow cards and a red last season, it was an early and almost costly blemish on his record for this season.\nToothless Terriers, tame Bluebirds\nIt may be a lack of attacking quality that limits both sides this season.\nCardiff had failed to hit the target despite taking 23 shots in their opening two Premier League games. Huddersfield, meanwhile, had scored only once in their previous seven matches at the John Smith's Stadium despite a total of 98 efforts.\nFor most of the match, with the two sides both still with 11 players, that trend continued.\nThe willing Steve Mounie brought a good save out of Neil Etheridge with a header but, as the hosts' lone striker, he was often short of support and supply.\nKenneth Zohore was a less obvious presence in the Cardiff attack before he was replaced by Danny Ward.\nJosh Murphy - signed from Norwich for about \u00a311m in the summer - had some bright moments for the visitors, but the wait for his side's first goal back in the top flight continues.\nMan of the match - Terence Kongolo (Huddersfield)\n'Unfortunately it was my player who wasn't clever' - what they said\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"I think, the first hour, we controlled the game. There was one team who wanted to do something in the offence and create opportunities and this was my team. We have known that in the last 10-15 minutes if we keep the tempo high, we will get the space, but unfortunately this was not the case because we went one man down.\n\"In the end this was a good point for us, the lads fought.\"\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock: \"We have got to take chances. Even before they went down to 10 men I thought we started the second half better, we should have scored and should have won the game.\n\"If you'd have said a point away from home before the game you'd take it but I'm disappointed not to get all three.\n\"Overall I thought the lads did all right. The longer the game went on, the better we became.\"\nOne from 15 for Warnock - the stats\nCardiff City boss Neil Warnock has won just one of his last 15 Premier League games as a manager and none of the last nine.\nHuddersfield Town have scored just one goal in their last eight matches at the John Smith's Stadium in all competitions, despite attempting 103 shots.\nSince the start of last season, Huddersfield Town have failed to score in 23 of their 41 Premier League games - more than any other team in this period.\nCardiff City have won just one of their last 18 away games in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield visit Stoke in the EFL Cup on Tuesday (20:00 BST) before travelling to Everton in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00).\nCardiff host Norwich in the EFL Cup on Tuesday (19:45) and are at home again next Sunday, to Arsenal in the Premier League (13:30)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 Leicester City: Harry Maguire scores stoppage time\nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes described Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's dismissal as \"soft\" as his 10 men were punished by a Harry Maguire stoppage-time winner for Leicester.\nWith 13 minutes remaining, and the game poised at 1-1, midfielder Hojbjerg was shown a second yellow card for diving in the penalty area.\nHughes said the sending-off was \"unfortunate\" but said Hojbjerg was \"walking a tightrope\" after being cautioned in the first half for a foul on James Maddison.\nAfter an uninspiring first half at St Mary's, defender Ryan Bertrand gave Saints the lead with a fierce left-footed strike from outside the area.\nThe advantage stood only briefly as Demarai Gray equalised for the visitors, pouncing on a loose ball to fire home from close range.\nBut in the second minute of time added on, England defender Maguire wrapped his right foot around the ball from 25 yards out to beat goalkeeper Alex McCarthy.\nSouthampton have won only once at home in the Premier League this year, but Hughes said: \"The manner of the performance gives me hope for the rest of the season because we definitely deserved to get something out of today's game.\"\nVictory was Leicester's second in succession this season and boss Claude Puel left the south coast having beaten his former club at St Mary's for the second time in a row.\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nSaturday's best stats\nLeicester find a way without Vardy\nMaguire may have earned a second Leicester victory in three games to start the season, but this was far from a vintage away performance.\nLeicester missed the pace of Jamie Vardy, who was suspended after being sent off in last week's win over Wolves.\nSouthampton enjoyed 62% of the possession in the first half, although Leicester responded well after the interval.\nThe creative James Maddison and Demarai Gray were stifled in attack by Saints' experienced and impressive midfielders Hojbjerg and Mario Lemina.\nThe service to Kelechi Iheanacho, who won only three of his 10 individual battles, was limited and Leicester struggled to find a way through against towering central defender Jannik Vestergaard.\nRedmond & Bertrand set standard for Saints\nNathan Redmond was a constant threat to Leicester and often had the beating of his opposite number Daniel Amartey in the early stages.\nThe left winger was ably supported by defender Ryan Bertrand, combining well to pepper the Leicester box with crosses as Saints won seven corners in the first 20 minutes.\nSuccess eventually came from that side of the field as Bertrand arrived to smash past Kasper Schmeichel, but Hughes is likely to be concerned about Southampton's lack of potency elsewhere.\nDanny Ings and Shane Long were unlikely to trouble Maguire and Wes Morgan aerially, but on the one occasion Redmond played the ball into Ings' feet, the striker spun his marker before being denied by Schmeichel from close range.\nOverall, there were not enough balls played in and around the front two as Southampton's possession failed to tell.\nMan of the match - Harry Maguire (Leicester)\n'We have to keep this mentality' - what they said\nLeicester City manager Claude Puel: \"Southampton played very well in the first half with intensity and it was difficult to find space.\n\"After, we found more space in the second half and the result was deserved. We dominated and we had two or three more chances to score.\"\nOn the winning goal: \"Harry is a very good player for us. It is fantastic for him to score, for him and the team.\n\"We have to keep this mentality to the end when we come back in the game.\"\nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes: \"We were excellent first half. We got our noses in front with a fantastic goal from Ryan but if we managed that game better, we could have come away with something.\n\"At that point, I thought the only winner was us, but momentum shifted and that was a really hammer blow to lose at the end.\"\nSouthampton throw away lead again - match stats\nSouthampton have lost 24 points from leading positions in the Premier League since the start of 2017-18, the most of any team currently in the top flight.\nLeicester finally won back-to-back away league matches at Southampton for the first time, on their 40th visit there (W5 D14 L21).\nSouthampton have won only one of their past 13 Premier League matches at St Mary's (W1 D6 L6).\nBefore beating Southampton, Leicester had lost the past six Premier League games in which they had fallen behind.\nSouthampton's Ryan Bertrand netted his first Premier League goal in 43 appearances, since scoring against Chelsea in April 2017.\nLeicester's Demarai Gray ended a run of 22 Premier League games without a goal, scoring for the first time in the competition since December 2017 v Newcastle.\nSince the start of last season, Leicester's Premier League games have seen eight red cards given, with only Everton's fixtures producing more in that period (11).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to south-coast rivals Brighton and Hove Albion in the second round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST), before visiting Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 September (15:00).\nLeicester host Fleetwood Town in the second round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday (19:45), before entertaining Liverpool on Saturday, 1 September (12:30)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-1 West Ham United: Unai Emery secures first win as Gunners boss\nArsenal head coach Unai Emery says his side \"need to improve\" in transition after the unconvincing Gunners recorded their first win under the Spaniard with victory over West Ham at Emirates Stadium.\nThe defensively frail hosts came from behind to lead in fortuitous fashion on 70 minutes as Hammers debutant Issa Diop diverted Alexandre Lacazette's volley across the area into his own net.\nHector Bellerin then picked out an unmarked Danny Welbeck in added time and the substitute turned to lift his effort past Lukasz Fabianski.\nArsenal were caught out on the counter for the opener, West Ham captain Marko Arnautovic slotting low past Petr Cech after exchanging passes with the impressive Felipe Anderson, who was allowed to carry the ball from deep.\nYet having both full-backs pushed up led to the equaliser five minutes later, Nacho Monreal firing into an unguarded net after Bellerin's cross deflected into his path off Alex Iwobi.\nEmery denies Ozil training ground row report\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nSaturday's best stats\n\"It was very important to win, and we showed that we can win in difficulty, after 1-0 in the first half,\" Emery told BBC Sport.\n\"We suffered with the transition in the first half, but we improved in the second half and controlled it more like we want.\n\"We need to improve in this transition to get the balance.\"\nArnautovic and Robert Snodgrass should have put West Ham in front again but shot straight at Cech, with former Gunner Lucas Perez also slicing wide late on in search of an equaliser as the visitors fell to a third straight defeat under their new manager Manuel Pellegrini.\nThe Hammers drop to bottom of the Premier League, while Emery's first win since replacing Arsene Wenger in May moves Arsenal up to 11th.\nFrail Arsenal need defensive improvement\nThe first half at times resembled a contest to determine which side's defence were more inept, with Arsenal edging it.\nTheir tactic of playing out from the back with Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis Papastathopoulos split either side of Cech was too easy for West Ham to disrupt, particularly with neither centre-back looking mobile enough.\nIt led to several chances for the visitors, as did having full-backs Monreal and Bellerin pushed high - the latter especially offered plenty of threat going forward but it meant West Ham had plenty of space to counter-attack into.\nAnderson exploited that space brilliantly throughout, driving at the Arsenal defence before playing a one-two with Arnautovic through Mustafi's legs and allowing the striker to pick his spot in the bottom corner from outside the area.\nElsewhere, Arsenal failed to pick up runners, with the offside Arnautovic wisely leaving Michail Antonio's through ball for the overlapping Snodgrass, only for the Scot to pick out Cech.\nThe hosts escaped with a win here but better sides will both carve them apart and finish their chances if the defending does not improve.\nOr will they just try to outscore opponents?\nArsenal showed glimpses of their attacking potential and started the game by dominating possession and winning tackles in midfield, with 19-year-old Frenchman Matteo Guendouzi impressing again.\nYet that spell in control lasted only 10 minutes and it took Diop's bizarre own goal to spark the Gunners' attack once more, with Lacazette and Aubameyang both going close as the Hammers reeled.\nAaron Ramsey had a goal rightly disallowed for offside and saw a low drive superbly saved by Fabianski late on as the midfielder proved an adequate replacement for Mesut Ozil, who Emery said was left out due to illness.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan produced a decent display, while summer signing Lucas Torreira was a positive influence after replacing the tiring Guendouzi, suggesting the makings of a fine midfield if Emery can find the right combination.\nMixed Hammers fall to the bottom\nWhile Arsenal's defence was more obviously shambolic in the first half, it was West Ham's that ultimately determined the result.\nIn the build-up to his own goal, Premier League debutant Diop miscued a clearance straight up in the air, allowing Rasmey to head the ball to Lacazette, who turned and found the net via the hapless retreating defender.\nElsewhere, the visitors could could have conceded more but for a fine performance by Fabianski against his former side.\nThe same could not be said for Jack Wilshere, the former Gunner kept largely anonymous throughout and cutting a frustrated figure as he picked up a late booking.\nMissed chances aside, West Ham showed promise going forward, with Anderson offering his side pace and crisp passing, while Arnautovic was a threat until he was forced off with a knee injury in the second half.\nThey need that knock to be nothing too serious to avoid a difficult start to the season turning into a real struggle.\nMan of the match - Felipe Anderson (West Ham)\n'It will come soon' - match reaction\nArsenal manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We are happy because it is the first three points after two defeats.\n\"In the second half we wanted to find more balance on the pitch and we did. It was a difficult match, for that we are happy but there are things to improve.\"\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Sport: \"They won 3-1, but if you analyse the game you see we had so many options to score the goal.\n\"I am very happy in the way we played, we played well with good pace and movement, so I am sure soon it will come.\n\"The team played well, it was a team that defended well. I am happy as a team we are improving on a lot of things we are trying to do.\"\nGunners extend London derby run - match stats\nArsenal are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League London derbies at the Emirates, winning seven and drawing three.\nWest Ham United have lost their first three games of the Premier League season for the third time this decade (also 2010-11 & 2017-18) after doing this just five times between 1920 and 2010.\nMarko Arnautovic has been directly involved in 19 Premier League goals since the start of last season (13 goals, 6 assists), eight more than any other West Ham player.\nIssa Diop is only the eighth player to score an own goal on his Premier League debut and the first to do so for West Ham United in the competition.\nArsenal striker Danny Welbeck netted his third Premier League goal against West Ham United; only against Aston Villa (4) and Everton (4) has he scored more.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are at Cardiff on Sunday, 2 September (13:30 BST), while West Ham are on EFL Cup duty against AFC Wimbledon on Tuesday (19:45) before hosting Wolves in the league on Saturday, 1 September at (15:00)."

These games are the best sessions we have to get fit.\n\"I knew before the game I had a lot of work to do and maybe now you know it as well.\"\nLiverpool were not at their fluid best, with their most dangerous moments coming before Salah struck.\nAfter Sadio Mane poked a shot just wide, Roberto Firmino drew a smart save out of Mat Ryan with a downward header before Trent Alexander-Arnold hit the bar with a free-kick.\nBrighton claimed a stunning 3-2 win against Manchester United in their previous game but rarely threatened to follow that up with an upset at Anfield.\nThey did, however, give the hosts some nervous moments in the closing stages and were denied a point when Alisson saved superbly from Pascal Gross' header.\n\"I'm really not interested in the table. It's really not important after the third matchday. Nine points are important,\" said Klopp.\n\"I expect a lot from the boys. I'm pretty demanding but I know we can improve.\"\nSalah picking up from where he left off?\nThis was not Salah's best game - he overhit a couple of passes and sent at least two shots into the upper tiers of the stand - but he was still able to provide the one moment of quality to decide a generally forgettable encounter.\nReceiving the ball inside the area from fellow forward Mane, Salah looked up before superbly steering a left-footed shot just out of reach of Ryan and just inside the far post.\nIt was his 29th goal in 29 games at Anfield and the 45th Premier League goal he has been directly involved in (34 goals and 11 assists) since the start of the last season - 12 more than any other player.\nHe has two goals after three league games this season - the same as he had at this stage of his debut campaign with Liverpool last term.\nBrighton beaten but not without a fight\nAlthough this was Brighton's second defeat in three games, their fans are unlikely to be discouraged by what they have seen from their team this season.\nTheir win against United was no fluke as they got in the faces of their opponents - showing no fear - and they displayed the same attitude at Liverpool.\nAttacking opportunities were limited as they focused on nullifying a Liverpool side that scored six goals in their first two games - and in that respect they largely succeeded.\nIn May, Brighton were thumped 4-0 by Liverpool in the final game of the season, but only Alisson's late save denied them a point.\nThe Seagulls appear to have come a long way in a short space of time and, if they continue to play in the style they have in their past two games, they have a strong chance of securing Premier League survival once again.\n\"It's a performance to be proud of but we're disappointed as well,\" said boss Chris Hughton. \"With the form Liverpool are in, you don't get too many opportunities to get something out of the game.\n\"You know they are going to have chances but we had chances as well. We finished strong and we won't have many better opportunities.\"\nMan of the match - James Milner\nConsistency key for Liverpool - the stats\nLiverpool have won their past six matches against Brighton in all competitions, scoring 21 goals and conceding five.\nOf the 17 teams to play in the Premier League last season and this season, Brighton have won the fewest points in away games (11).\nLiverpool have kept 11 clean sheets in the Premier League in 18 games since Virgil van Dijk's debut in January 2018, more than any other side in that period.\nLiverpool named the same starting XI in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since May 2017.\nUnder Jurgen Klopp, Roberto Firmino has had a hand in 59 Premier League goals (36 goals, 23 assists), 14 more than any other Liverpool player.\nLiverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum completed 75 of his 76 passes in the game (98.7% accuracy), with his one misplaced pass coming in the 80th minute.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool travel to Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 September (12:30), while Brighton host Southampton in the League Cup second round on Tuesday (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Watford beat Crystal Palace to maintain perfect start in Premier League\nWatford manager Javi Gracia says his side have achieved \"something massive\" after beating Crystal Palace to win their opening three games of the season for the first time in their top-flight history.\nThe Hornets maintained their perfect start in the Premier League to move behind Liverpool and level with Chelsea at the top of the table on goal difference.\nRoberto Pereyra scored his third goal in as many games with an exquisite curling effort, before Jose Holebas added a seemingly unintentional second from outside the area in a resurgent second-half display.\n\"There is no secret. The most important thing is to work hard, and the players are being rewarded for all of their outstanding work from the pre-season,\" said Gracia.\n\"Pereyra is scoring goals and he is an important player for us, but I would like to recognise the players that are not playing at the moment.\"\nWatford had been fortunate to be level at the interval, veteran goalkeeper Ben Foster pulling off two reflex saves to deny Christian Benteke and James McArthur early on.\nPalace threatened in the opening exchanges despite their talisman Wilfried Zaha being the victim of a fierce tackle from Etienne Capoue, for which the Watford midfielder was fortunate to receive only a booking.\nZaha did pull a goal back for the visitors late on, beating his marker to drill the ball through Foster's legs, but Watford withstood the fightback to claim all three points.\nHolebas shines in the rain\nWatford have won their opening three games of a top-flight campaign for the first time, and Holebas' performance epitomised their impressive early season form.\nFoster was crucial in keeping Palace at bay in the first half, but Holebas was equally influential, as well as supporting attacks at the other end.\nWhen McArthur played a neat one-two with Benteke and ran into the hosts' box, Holebas was on hand to slide in and nick the ball away as the Palace player was poised to shoot.\nAnd the defender's first Premier League goal since October 2016 ultimately proved the difference, if rather fortuitously, as he admitted to Sky Sports afterwards that it was an attempted cross that deceived Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey and looped into the corner.\nIn Pereyra, Watford have a real talisman. The Argentine has been directly involved in seven of the club's past 10 goals in the Premier League, scoring six and assisting another and it was a moment of brilliance to open the scoring as he curled the ball past a diving Wayne Hennessey from just inside the area.\nWatford's three wins have come against Brighton, Burnley and Crystal Palace, and clearly they will face tougher challenges, but with the work ethic and determination on show by Holebas and his team-mates today, Javi Gracia's men have every prospect of a successful season.\nZaha on target despite special attention\nWatford had clearly focused their efforts on stopping Zaha, but in the fourth minute Capoue crossed a line when he appeared to stamp on the Ivory Coast international's Achilles. On another day the Frenchman might not have been on the pitch long enough to assist in Pereyra's opening goal.\nZaha had a fairly quiet game after that incident, although he did burst into life to give the Eagles hope of a point in the final 15 minutes, his strike making him the club's all-time highest goalscorer in the Premier League with 24.\nPalace had two excellent opportunities to take an early lead, but Foster was in inspired form to deny the hosts.\nBenteke should have done better in the 12th minute when he rose highest to meet Andros Townsend's cross in the six-yard box, but the Belgian striker headed at Foster.\nMinutes later, McArthur found himself one-on-one with the former England goalkeeper, but the midfielder's effort was well saved.\nThe result at Vicarage Road follows defeat against Liverpool on Monday and Roy Hodgson will be concerned about his side's goal threat, especially when Zaha is the subject of special attention from their opponents.\nThe 25-year-old has scored two of the club's three goals so far this season and the former England boss needs an alternative goal threat.\nMan of the match - Roberto Pereyra (Watford)\n'We were unlucky he was not sent off' - what they said\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"There's no particular anger as such. We didn't start the second half well and went a goal down. We were unlucky in that their second goal drifted over the keeper's head helped by the wind. At 2-0 we were facing a mountain.\n\"If the game had gone on another five or 10 minutes we could have got another goal and a draw would not have been an unfair result. It is very frustrating when you are 2-1 down and you are in the ascendancy but you can't get hold of the ball.\"\nOn Capoue's booking: \"We're not happy about the foul. I've only just seen it again on television. I'd have to say we were unlucky he was not sent off.\"\nOn Watford targeting Zaha: \"We have to get used to that. Players of his match-winning ability do get targeted. He was targeted by that foul but he got over that and his ending to the game was quite good.\"\nWatford boss Javi Gracia: \"I'm very happy because it is always difficult to get a result in the Premier League. We have three wins and it is amazing. The players have been rewarded because they have worked very hard.\n\"It is only three steps but I'm very proud to be Watford coach.\"\nOn Capoue's challenge: \"To be honest I didn't see the action. It was a rainy day with many contacts. If you speak to me about Capoue, I didn't see it.\"\nWatford end Palace's run at Vicarage Road - match stats\nWatford have won their opening three games of a top-flight league campaign for the first time in their history.\nThis was Crystal Palace's first league defeat at Watford since February 2009 (2-0 in a Championship meeting), having been unbeaten in seven trips prior to today (W3 D4).\nWatford's current run of three consecutive wins in the Premier League is their second-longest winning streak in competition history, and just one short of their record of four games (in December 2015 under Quique Sanchez Flores).\nWatford have lost only one of their nine home games in the Premier League under Javi Gracia (W6 D2), including wins in each of their most recent three.\nWilfried Zaha is now Crystal Palace's top scorer in Premier League history (24), overtaking Chris Armstrong who netted 23 goals in the competition for the Eagles.\nRoberto Pereyra has been directly involved in seven of Watford's last 11 goals in the Premier League, scoring six and assisting another.\nNine of Roberto Pereyra's 10 goals in the Premier League have been scored at Vicarage Road, including each of his last six in the competition.\nJose Holebas has been directly involved in three of Watford's four Premier League goals at Vicarage Road this season (one goal and two assists).\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Reading in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, 28 August (20:00 BST) before hosting Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday (16:00).

In the first minute, he was caught on the back of the ankle by the studs of Matt Ritchie, and was then clattered on the right leg by Mohamed Diame.\nOff the ball Hazard moved gingerly at times, but for the most part he was the driving force for Chelsea, whose dogged and unrelenting attack finally came to fruition in the latter stages.\nHazard's well-taken penalty was his 70th Premier League goal for Chelsea, which puts him behind only Frank Lampard (147) and Didier Drogba (104) in the club record books.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\nJorginho completes more passes than Newcastle - match stats\nJorginho completed 158 passes out of a possible 173, more than the whole Newcastle side combined (131).\nVictory was Chelsea's first in the Premier League at St James' Park since December 2011, having drawn one and lost four of their previous five matches.\nMaurizio Sarri is the fifth Chelsea manager to win his opening three Premier League games after Antonio Conte, Carlo Ancelotti, Guus Hiddink and Jose Mourinho.\nAll six of Joselu's six Premier League goals for Newcastle have come at St James' Park.\nWhat they said\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"Both the penalty and foul leading up to it were very doubtful.\n\"We had six players out. Jonjo Shelvey was not there for us today but we did a good job and it was a pity.

We know a huge job is ahead of us and we must keep going,\" added Jokanovic.\n\"This is most competitive league in the world and this is not going to be an easy job for us.\"\nLift-off for Fulham\nWith the knowledge that their opponents have been stretched by European engagements, the Cottagers seized their opportunity to kick-start their season in style with a first Premier League victory since April 2014.\nAfter two defeats, Jokanovic's attempts to gel Fulham's new and old saw him hand a first start to Atletico Madrid loanee Luciano Vietto in a side consisting of seven summer additions.\nThey began with purpose, taking the game to slow-starting Burnley and Seri's superb strike set the tone as Fulham demonstrated quality across their side - with the Ivorian himself at the heart of the hosts' good play.\nFulham enjoyed more than two-thirds of the possession in the first half and both Schurrle and the lively Timothy Fosu-Mensah had attempts that, though unable to trouble Hart, offered warnings to Burnley.\nBut Mitrovic, now with three goals in as many Premier League games since signing permanently from Newcastle, looks as if he will be vital for Jokanovic's side, proving a constant nuisance to Tarkowski and Ben Mee - though he should have added even more to his tally.\nFulham's heavy investment in high-quality players over the close season - a reported \u00a3100m across 12 additions - suggests that, although survival is an obvious priority, continuing to play positively is also high on the agenda.\nThey demonstrated their ability to do so here very effectively.\n\"It's an important step for us. We showed it is possible and we are satisfied with many things,\" Jokanovic said.\n\"We know after the first two defeats it's not easy for us to find the right way. There is room for improvement and we need to push harder on the training ground.\"\nBurnley's tough start continues\nFollowing a 3-1 loss to Watford last weekend, Burnley's midweek Europa League play-off defeat by Olympiakos in Greece by the same score raised further questions over the Clarets' capacity to successfully balance European and domestic competition.\nThey extended their winless run in the league to eight matches with defeat at Fulham, and have now conceded 10 goals in their past three in all competitions despite surrendering just four in six previous to that.\nSean Dyche reverted to the same side that had contested Burnley's opening two Premier League fixtures, a total of six changes from Thursday night, but the Clarets conceded early for a second league game on the bounce.\nThere has been plenty made of Burnley's busy schedule, but they now face an uphill task if they are to reach the Europa League group stages, and exiting that competition will only increase pressure on their league performances.\n\"It's about working hard as well as smart,\" said Dyche.\n\"The players have been peppered with messages of 'it's too much being in the Europa League'. You can't make excuses because everyone wanted that challenge at the club.\"\nOnce again Dyche's men showed spirit to respond positively to going behind, pulling back to 3-2 just before half-time when Tarkowski converted from close range.\nBut spirit was far from enough to deny a lively Fulham side, who peppered Hart's goal in the closing stages as the Clarets saw their winless record away to promoted sides extend to 10 games.\nMan of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic\n'We can't make excuses' - what they said\nFulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic: \"It was a tough game. Every goal is a nice goal and a great feeling but the most important thing is we grab the three points and give the fans a nice afternoon.\n\"We have so many new players. They came from different leagues and some don't speak English but this is the best league, we want to stay with the best and we will work hard to do that.\n\"No matter what we do, we will stick to our system and that will give us more confidence to stay in this league.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"Fulham had a good season last season but they have added some quality. It was a fair shift of money. But I thought they were the better side overall. They had the best player on the pitch in Mitrovic.\n\"Things aren't going our way with injuries. We didn't get as many in in the market as we'd like to help us across two competitions. We have to concentrate on what's in front of us and that's the next game.\"\nMitrovic fares well against Hart - the stats\nAleksandar Mitrovic has scored 15 league goals since his Fulham debut in February - and only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah can match that total in that time across the top four tiers of English football.\nFour of Mitrovic's 13 Premier League goals have been scored against Joe Hart, having also scored for Newcastle in October 2015 against Manchester City and West Ham.\nBurnley goalkeeper Hart has conceded at least three goals in five of the past past six Premier League games he has played in the month of August, conceding 17 in total.\nSince a run of five consecutive Premier League wins between March and April, Burnley have collected just three points from three draws in eight league games.\nAfter failing to score with any of his first 24 shots in the Premier League, Burnley defender James Tarkowski has scored with two of his last three in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nFulham host Exeter City in the League Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST), followed by a trip to Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 BST).\nBurnley host Olympiakos in the second leg of their Europa League play-off on Thursday (19:45 BST) before Manchester United visit Turf Moor in the Premier League on Sunday (16:00 BST)."

Respect! Respect!' - Mourinho's message to journalists\nWhich Man Utd player got 2.8 out of 10? How the players rated\nPhil McNulty: A collection of faulty parts, not a united team\nSpurs were simply too good for United after the break and the contest was effectively over once Kane directed in a superb header for his first goal at Old Trafford after 50 minutes and Moura swiftly swept home Christian Eriksen's perfect pass for the second.\nThe outstanding Moura raced clear to add the third six minutes from time to make it nine points from nine for Spurs.\nMourinho was a dejected figure amid a sea of empty red seats at the final whistle, having lost two of his opening three Premier League games for the first time in his career.\nCounterpart Mauricio Pochettino, in contrast, was able celebrate his first victory as Spurs manager at Old Trafford after four straight losses without scoring a goal.\nA chastening, miserable night for Mourinho\nUnited are only three games into the new season so it is very early for alarm bells to be ringing, but there is no escaping the fact this has been a dismal start and this side Mourinho has assembled so expensively looks in no shape to challenge for the title.\nThe manner - as well as the margin - of this loss only increases the feeling of discontent around Old Trafford since the summer.\nMourinho will feel increasing heat but he can rightly point to the pivotal moment when, with United on top, Lukaku missed that simple chance.\nThere was no lack of effort from United's players but there was an element of collapse to their efforts after Spurs struck twice so quickly.\nBut this is currently a disjointed team, with Mourinho appearing to be scrambling to find a solution to the very obvious problems he faces in central defence.\nHe utilised midfielder Ander Herrera in a three-man central defensive system alongside the old guard of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling - with Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof paying the price for lamentable performances in the loss at Brighton.\nIt was obvious why Mourinho was desperate to add central defensive reinforcements, but he was also responsible for the acquisition of Bailly and Lindelof at a cost of more than \u00a360m.\nHe will also be concerned at the complete lack of a response from his players once Spurs delivered that devastating one-two that effectively settled this game in their favour.\nThis was a chastening, miserable night for United and their manager.\nFootball Daily podcast: Is Mourinho starting to crack?\nMourinho's muddle and other Premier League stats\nLandmark win for Spurs?\nMourinho's troubles at United will rightly be the subject of so much attention, but this was a magnificent night for Spurs, who looked a force to be reckoned with.\nTheir players and supporters celebrated this superb victory in the manner that befitted what might just be a landmark night for Pochettino's team.\nIt has been a charge regularly levelled at Spurs that they struggle to win games away at their closest title rivals. They put that right in the most emphatic manner possible.\nBefore this victory, Spurs had won only one of 12 league games against the so-called 'big six' since beating Manchester City in February 2016, so this result will surely do wonders for their self-belief as they attempt to take the next step in their search for silverware.\nOnce they got into their stride, they simply accelerated away from United.\nKane's magnificent header established the platform, while the pace of Moura - fed brilliantly by Christian Eriksen for his first goal - simply carried too much pace for a leaden-footed United defence.\nSpurs, after a slow start, grew in authority, and how did Mourinho and United feel when they saw Toby Alderweireld's powerful defensive display with contributions of importance throughout? He was linked with United this summer but did not arrive.\nIn fact, when Alderweireld made a superb sliding challenge in the second half, some United fans turned towards executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward in the directors' box to make their feelings known.\nFor all the talk of Mourinho and missed transfer targets, it is worth remembering Pochettino did not buy any players this summer and can now reflect on three wins from three games this season.\nMan of the match - Lucas Moura (Tottenham)\n'I don't consider it a difficult time' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"The fans are the best judges in football and they were fantastic to the players.\n\"I wanted to make sure the fans had from us what they deserve and wanted to be fair to them because they were fantastic. I don't consider it a difficult time.\n\"[We were] the best team, the offensive team, the team that pressed hard, that created chances and missed chances, but then from the first corner that Tottenham had they scored one goal and immediately that team was in the game.\n\"I'm frustrated but I'm happy with the players and the performance. We created more chances today than in the majority of our matches.\n\"What I was trying to do was to keep their motivation and that's not easy. Normally when you play well you win it, and that's what I try not to let go away with the score. One goal comes and everything can change.\"\nOn the United defence: \"We worked amazingly well this week but there are things that you can't resolve.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"It is a massive victory for us and I am very proud of the performance.\n\"It is difficult to beat Manchester United at Old Trafford. They were better in the first half but we dominated from then on, and the clean sheet was a bonus.\n\"It is only the start of the season and we need to be consistent. We need to be realistic but want to keep pushing and building our fitness. A lot of our players have only had three weeks training but we want to build something special.\"\nPochettino backs Lloris after drink-driving charge\nMourinho's biggest home defeat - the stats\nTottenham have begun a top-flight season with three wins from three games for only the fifth time in history, and the first since 2009-10.\nManchester United have lost two of their opening three Premier League games for the first time since 1992-93, when they ended up winning the title in the competition's inaugural season.\nThis was United boss Jose Mourinho's biggest home defeat in all competitions as a manager.\nMourinho has lost two of his opening three games in a league season for the first time in his career.\nAll three of Tottenham's league wins at Old Trafford have come with a different manager at the helm - Andre Villas-Boas (Sep 2012), Tim Sherwood (Jan 2014) and Mauricio Pochettino.\nThis was United's 50th home defeat in the Premier League.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane has scored at 25 of the 28 Premier League grounds he has played at, the exceptions being Upton Park, the Stadium of Light and Cardiff City Stadium.\nThere were just 133 seconds between Tottenham's opening two goals - the quickest time between two goals for the away side at Old Trafford since April 2012 (112 seconds between Nikica Jelavic and Steven Pienaar strikes for Everton).\nWhat's next?\nUnited travel to Turf Moor to play Burnley and Tottenham face Watford at Vicarage Road, with both games on Sunday 2 September (16:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool maintain 100% start with nervy win at Leicester\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said Alisson's horrendous error \"was clearly going to happen one day\", after his side maintained their 100% start to the season with victory at Leicester.\nKlopp's team looked on course for a comfortable win when, after Mohamed Salah had uncharacteristically missed an open goal, Sadio Mane pounced in the penalty area to poke Liverpool in front after only 10 minutes.\nLiverpool's position looked even more secure when Roberto Firmino stole in on James Milner's corner to double their advantage with a header on the stroke of half-time - but they then proceeded to make life difficult for themselves.\nThe main culprit was Alisson, the \u00a367m summer signing from Roma, who was embarrassed as he gifted Leicester a goal after 63 minutes when he was robbed by Kelechi Iheanacho while inexplicably performing an elaborate turn with the ball at his feet in the area, Rachid Ghezzal scoring following the ensuing chaos.\nLeicester pushed for the equaliser but Liverpool closed out victory to make it four wins out of four at the start of a league season for the first time in 28 years - and leave Alisson the most relieved man inside the King Power Stadium.\n\"It was clearly going to happen one day,\" Klopp said of Alisson's error. \"I didn't think it was going to happen in the next match [after his successful showboating against Brighton last time out, when he chipped an onrushing attacker]. It's all OK. He knows he could have cleared the situation.\n\"I said last week we need to get used to it. Don't constantly give the goalkeeper the ball, there are other solutions. He's a fantastic goalkeeper who makes fantastic saves and of course in this situation he did not do what he should have done, but it's all good.\"\nLiverpool win - but suffer in victory\nLiverpool can call on an old saying to bolster their confidence even further after making it four wins from four at the start of the Premier League season - namely it is a sign of champions that you can still win when well short of your best.\nAnd this certainly applied here, with Klopp's side mediocre for long periods, yet still emerging victorious in the face of Leicester's spirited challenge.\nLiverpool opened in the sort of blistering fashion that has blown teams apart in the past, with Salah missing an open goal even before Mane pounced on a rebound off Harry Maguire to score.\nThey then, surprisingly, became subdued, only to score against the run of play as Firmino guided in Milner's corner on the stroke of half-time.\nLiverpool looked rocky under pressure as Leicester stepped up the pace after the break, with even the normally unflappable Virgil van Dijk rattled as he was put under a thorough examination.\nThey could not control midfield, while Salah was, for once, totally out of sorts and could have had no complaints when he was eventually replaced by Xherdan Shaqiri.\nFor all that, Liverpool dug deep and secured another three points in a season when they and Klopp know there will be little or no margin for error.\nOn another day Salah will shine, their defence will be in control and Alisson will not make the sort of horrendous error that turned up the heat on Liverpool even further.\nThere will be days throughout Liverpool's season when the result will over-ride the performance - and this was undoubtedly one of them.\nAlisson has to learn quickly\nAlisson has already raised eyebrows and attracted attention for his confidence with the ball at his feet, notably his willingness to audaciously chip an oncoming Brighton attacker during last weekend's victory at Anfield.\nThere is, however, a time and a place - and the time he chose at the King Power Stadium was definitely not it.\nAlisson was trying to be too clever by half when he embarked on a dainty turn and backheel as Iheanacho chased down Van Dijk's slightly wayward backpass.\nFor all the modern thinking, this was an occasion when the big boot should have been applied - as Klopp's emphatic gesture on the touchline subsequently suggested. Alisson decided otherwise, played himself straight into trouble and the whole calamity ended with Ghezzal scoring. It gave Leicester the sort of opportunity that could have proved very costly.\nLiverpool have suffered enough at the hands of goalkeeping errors, such as those of Loris Karius in the Champions League final, so this moment will have revived some uncomfortable memories.\nLiverpool spared Alisson's blushes by holding on for the three points but you suspect the Brazilian will be on the receiving end of a sharp reminder from Klopp not to repeat those sorts of mistakes.\nAlisson himself insisted afterwards he will not make the same error again, describing it as a \"reading the play mistake\".\n\"I didn't receive that good of a pass. We talked about that in the locker room,\" he added.\n\"I won't be stupid to make the same mistake. It's part of my game. I won't be arrogant, saying that I will keep doing this. We have to learn from our mistakes.\n\"I think that it was a foul, but we can't support ourselves on that. In this kind of play, here in the Premier League, not every collision is a foul.\"\n'If you're a forward you are not going to get fooled'\nFormer Newcastle and England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day:\nHis manager said he has got away with the mistake and that is fine, but he got away with one at Brighton last week as well.\nIf you're a forward and you have seen the footage against Brighton, you are not going to get fooled again. The Leicester player gambles and gets the reward.\nAlisson should be getting rid of that ball and there was no need to do it. They were in cruise control but then the panic sets in and it was unnecessary. He won't make that mistake again.\nLeicester show real fighting spirit\nLeicester, having kept faith with manager Claude Puel, have made a promising start to the season with victories at home to Wolves and at Southampton following an opening-day defeat at Manchester United.\nAnd here, despite the home defeat, there was plenty for Puel and his players to take from a display that showed real character and determination, especially without suspended main striker Jamie Vardy.\nThe Foxes could have been forgiven for thinking the fates were against them when Firmino made that crucial intervention to give Liverpool a two-goal lead right on half-time.\nLeicester, however, regrouped and gave it a real go after the break in the sort of manner that suggests more good things than bad lie ahead of them this season, which was reflected in the generous reception their supporters gave them at the final whistle.\nMan of the match - Joe Gomez\nMatch of the Day pundit Martin Keown: \"Gomez is a real talent. Today he was better than Van Dijk and that's some compliment. His mobility, the way he floats across the pitch, he can pass the ball, has the technique and the vision. He has everything in his game. Gareth Southgate must be licking his lips to work with him because he is an immense talent.\"\n'We were a little lucky, but we deserved to win' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to Sky Sports: \"We could have scored earlier in the game, I said a few times in the past a dry pitch means not good football. Leicester wanted to be aggressive but couldn't because we moved so well. We were in a few situations a little lucky, but think we deserved to win.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel speaking to Sky Sports: \"I'm disappointed for my players because they gave their best. The second half was fantastic, we showed good quality and had a lot of chances. We had good tempo, good aggression. We played with confidence and we had the chances to come back. It is encouraging.\"\nMane loves facing the Foxes - the key stats\nMane has had a hand in four goals in his past four league games against Leicester (two goals, two assists).\nLiverpool have not lost an away league game when scoring first since December 2016, when they were beaten 4-3 by Bournemouth.\nMilner has now registered 80 Premier League assists, the same as David Beckham. Only six players have more in the competition.\nNo player has assisted Firmino more times in the Premier League than Milner (eight).\nUnder Klopp, Firmino has been directly involved in 60 Premier League goals (37 goals, 23 assists), 15 more than any other Liverpool player.\nLeicester are the first Premier League team to have three different Algerians score for them (also Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani).\nSince the start of last season, no player has more assists in the top four tiers than James Maddison (16). The former Norwich man is level with Kevin de Bruyne and Barry Douglas.\nLeicester have lost their past 11 Premier League matches against sides starting the day top of the table, scoring just five goals while conceding 27 in those matches.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, next up for Liverpool is a trip to Wembley to play Tottenham in the early game on Saturday, 15 September (12:30 BST), while Leicester face Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium later that day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-1 Huddersfield: Toffees maintain unbeaten start with comeback draw\nEverton came from behind against Huddersfield to maintain their unbeaten start to the season in a disappointing game at Goodison Park.\nThe hosts enjoyed most of the possession, but failed to register a shot on target, before Philip Billing gave the Terriers a surprise lead in the 33rd minute when he headed past Jordan Pickford from a corner.\nHuddersfield's lead lasted just 87 seconds as Dominic Calvert-Lewin equalised by the same method, diverting a Lucas Digne cross past the diving Jonas Lossl.\nToffees boss Marcos Silva introduced Ademola Lookman off the bench in the second period, and the 20-year-old created the best chance of the half when he produced a tantalising cross that just eluded Calvert-Lewin and Gylfi Sigurdsson with the goal at their mercy.\nThe result lifts David Wagner's side out of the relegation zone into 17th, while Everton climb one place into seventh.\nEverton struggle to break down resilient Terriers\nHuddersfield came to Goodison Park with a gameplan, and they executed it perfectly.\nWagner's men sat deep with 10 men behind the ball straight from kick-off, inviting pressure from the hosts as they tried to break them down.\nEverton had 59% of the possession in the first half, but they failed to create anything of note, and defenders Seamus Coleman and Kurt Zouma had the best opportunities.\nCalvert-Lewin was brought in to replace their suspended top-scorer Richarlison, and although the youngster got off the mark for the season with the equaliser, Everton lacked the trickery and guile to break through their organised opponents.\nIn fact, the hosts, who lost Theo Walcott to injury in the second half, only managed a single shot on goal in the whole game.\nRicharlison will still be missing for the meeting with West Ham but Silva could turn to Lookman, who impressed off the bench.\nHuddersfield attack remains a concern\nHuddersfield avoided relegation by four points last season - and the objective for the new campaign will be to retain their Premier League status once more.\nA battling point at Goodison Park is exactly the type of result the Terriers will need. The visitors were set up to limit their opponents' success between the lines, and as Wagner acknowledged afterwards: \"Our formation worked.\"\nBut while they took the lead from a set piece, they posed very little threat from open play.\nComing into the game, the Terriers had failed to score in 23 of their 41 Premier League games - more than any other team in this period.\nBilling's header was only his side's second goal of the season, and Wagner admitted not \"creating more opportunities\" was his one concern about the day.\nMan of the match - Kurt Zouma (Everton)\n'Everton don't look the strongest on set-pieces' - what they said\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner said: \"I'm happy with the effort, performance and attitude from the players. We limited Everton - everyone knows how difficult it can be here - they only had shots from distance and headers.\n\"I'm fine with this point, although with a bit more relaxation on the ball, we could have created more opportunities.\n\"We've discussed before that Everton don't look the strongest on defending set-pieces. We've scored a great goal - we had worked on it and it paid off. Defensively our shape worked, our formation worked - we wanted to close the inside gaps and overload the wings. You have to show the passion and desire. \"\nEverton manager Marcos Silva said: \"We didn't perform well. It wasn't a good game.\n\"They had nine players behind the ball. When we play against that type of team, we have to play faster in certain moments of the game to disorganise them. We didn't create enough chances to score.\n\"As well as Richarlison, Theo [Walcott] with a problem in his hips is another problem for us.\n\"It was important to score fast and react well after their goal. The second half was difficult as they just waited for our mistakes.\"\nHuddersfield's 81-year wait for a Goodison win goes on - match stats\nHuddersfield have won none of their past 15 away games against Everton in all competitions (D3 L12), last winning there 2-1 in the top flight in September 1937.\nEverton recorded their 200th score draw in the Premier League, more than any other team in the competition.\nYorkshire teams have won none of their past 16 Premier League visits to Goodison Park (D6 L10) since Sheffield Wednesday won 2-1 there in April 1999.\nSince the start of last season, Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been directly involved in more goals for Everton in all competitions than any other player (11 goals, six assists).\nHuddersfield's Philip Billing scored his first league goal since February 2017 vs Reading, ending a run of 31 appearances without a goal (including play-offs).\nWhat's next?\nEverton resume their Premier League campaign at home to West Ham on Sunday, 16 September (16:00 BST), while Huddersfield host Crystal Palace on Saturday, 15 September (15:00)."

        "article_text": "West Ham remain pointless after Wolves grab late win\nWest Ham's miserable start to the season continued as substitute Adama Traore gave Wolves victory with an injury-time winner.\nTraore fired home in the 93rd minute just as it looked as though the hosts would earn their first point of the campaign.\nThe result gives Wolves their first top-flight win since 4 February 2012, and means West Ham have lost all four league games under Manuel Pellegrini.\nMichail Antonio and Marko Arnautovic spurned the Hammers' best chances.\nThe home side had one of their best openings after just four minutes, when Felipe Anderson's shot forced Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio into action.\nWe should be worried - Pellegrini\nRelive the live coverage\nReaction to all the games\nBut neither side asserted themselves in a tame first half, with Matt Doherty's shot on target the only worrying moment for West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nPatricio denied Antonio and Arnautovic with excellent blocks after half-time, the latter when the Portuguese stopped a shot with his face, as West Ham improved markedly.\nRaul Jimenez tripped over the ball when free inside the area late on with what looked to be the visitors' last chance, until Traore's dramatic intervention in stoppage time.\nWorrying signs for West Ham\nDefeat means West Ham have lost their first four games of a league campaign for only the second time.\nThe previous occasion sets a worrying precedent, as that season - 2010-11 - ended in relegation.\nThat scenario is a long way away from what the Hammers were imagining when they recruited Pellegrini, a Premier League winner with Manchester City at his first attempt in 2013-14, as manager.\nThey lacked bite in the first half but created more chances almost from the start of the second, when Andriy Yarmolenko replaced Robert Snodgrass.\nStriker Javier Hernandez remained on the bench until the 75th minute, although the Hammers looked the likelier to break the deadlock.\nBut Carlos Sanchez lost the ball in his own half deep into stoppage time, and within seconds Wolves had seized their chance to ensure West Ham remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League.\nWolves have bite and menace\nWolves were also without a win before their visit to London Stadium, but the second of their two points before kick-off had come from a spirited display in a draw with Pellegrini's former club and reigning champions Manchester City.\nPossibly inspired by that result, they were the better side before the break with Helder Costa and Joao Moutinho driving on Nuno Espirito Santo's side.\nJimenez's moment to forget, when the Mexican striker was put in on goal by a fine pass from Ruben Neves only to get the ball trapped between his feet, could easily have knocked last season's Championship winners off their stride.\nBut they took their chance at the crucial moment with Traore's crisp finish, and are showing signs they will pose problems for the rest of the Premier League this season.\nMan of the match - Joao Moutinho (Wolves)\n'West Ham deserved to get booed off'\nFormer Newcastle and England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day:\nWolves I thought were magnificent and they have proved they are here to stay. They were very exciting last weekend and they were even better today.\nFrom a West Ham point of view you would think they would have shown a bit of fight and roll their sleeves up after three defeats. 'Embarrassing', 'hopeless' and 'pathetic' - you could use all three to describe them.\nHow on earth are you going to score goals with no one in the area? From one corner, they had four or five players already on their way back into their own half after the corner was taken.\nFor the goal, Carlos Sanchez has got nine yards to take a touch but he loses it. Aaron Cresswell has five yards on Adama Traore, but two seconds later, the Wolves player is miles ahead of him. They were terrible and they deserved to get booed off.\nWhat the managers said\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini:\n\"I don't think it is a bad start, it is a very bad start. We can't lose six points here at home like we have. Playing away against Liverpool and Arsenal and you don't play so well is understandable. Here at home to lose we must be very worried.\n\"In the first half we didn't play like the home team looking for three points. The second we improved a lot, made that mistake in the last minute that lost us the game.\n\"In the training ground we are doing well, no lack of attitude. We have to take that work during the week to a game where there is that added pressure. It is just to four games , we won't stop fighting now. We are just starting and will resolve that problem\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo:\n\"It feels good, even if we didn't win the boys worked hard. Both teams could have won but in that moment were more in control. We were in control in the first half. Happy for the fans, it is massive to come a long way and get three points.\nOn their goal: \"Sometimes in the moment both could have won, West Ham had a chance late, to get the goal means we recovered the ball so high up the pitch, our midfielder recovered it and that says so much about the team. The boys did well.\n\"The confidence comes from performances not results. From the first day of the season we are improving even without results. When you establish your standards and we reach them that means growth, today we did it.

        "article_text": "Chelsea beat Bournemouth 2-0 to extend 100% start in Premier League\nChelsea can still improve despite opening the Premier League season with four successive victories, says head coach Maurizio Sarri.\nGoals from substitute Pedro and Eden Hazard gave the Blues victory over Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.\nThe result leaves Chelsea level on points with leaders Liverpool, who have a superior goal difference, heading into the first international break of the season.\nSarri succeeded fellow Italian Antonio Conte in the summer after the Blues finished 30 points behind champions Manchester City last season.\n\"I'm very happy with 12 points in four matches. But I always think we can do more. We can improve,\" said the former Napoli boss.\n\"I think now for us it's better to think of the next match. Because the gap at the beginning was 30 points. I think it's very difficult to cover this gap in only one season.\"\nBournemouth produced a gritty defensive display and missed two glaring chances when the game was goalless.\n\"Chelsea are a different team this year, a totally different way of playing,\" said Cherries boss Eddie Howe, whose side won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge last season.\n\"They'll be a difficult team to play against.\"\nReaction from Stamford Bridge and around the Premier League\nBlues dig deep to continue winning start\nChelsea had to dig deep against a resolute Bournemouth to earn their latest win under Sarri - and once again they left it late to wrap up the points.\nTwo weeks ago, their winner at home to Arsenal did not arrive until the 81st minute. At Newcastle last week, it was even later.\nAgainst the Cherries, Hazard's second goal in as many games - which sealed the points - came five minutes from time. Sarri's side had dominated possession but struggled to break down Bournemouth until Pedro struck seven minutes after replacing Willian.\nThe Spaniard exchanged passes with fellow substitute Olivier Giroud before his deflected finish beat former Blues keeper Asmir Begovic for his third league goal in four games.\nHazard doubled the lead with a quality finish from an angle.\nAt 0-0, Marcos Alonso was denied by the post before he was further frustrated by a fine save from Begovic.\nBut victory came eventually - and Chelsea have won their opening four games of the season for the first time since 2014-15, when they won the title.\nBigger tests lie ahead, but the Blues have made a strong start under Sarri.\nPositives in defeat for Cherries\nThis was Bournemouth's first Premier League defeat since losing at Southampton on 28 April.\nHaving stunned Conte's Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last season, they were good value for a point until Pedro struck after 72 minutes.\nHowe gave Premier League debuts to \u00a325m record signing Jefferson Lerma and Spanish full-back Diego Rico, and his side were hard-working and organised for long spells.\nBut they should have taken the lead, two glaring misses either side of the interval at 0-0, as Callum Wilson fired over from close range before Nathan Ake failed to hit the target against his old club from inside the six-yard box.\n\"Until that first goal I do think the game was in the balance,\" said Howe.\n\"We knew we were going to have limited opportunities to score. We did create the best moments in the game. Those one or two moments you do get, you've got to try to take.\"\nDespite defeat, the Cherries remain sixth in the table after two wins and a draw from their opening four games.\nThey now face Leicester (home), Burnley (away), Crystal Palace (home), Watford (away), Southampton (home) and Fulham (away) before they come up against another major top-four contender - Manchester United at home on 3 November.\nMan of the match - Marcos Alonso (Chelsea)\nMatch of the Day pundit Martin Keown: \"Alonso is different class down the left. They changed their formation this year to adapt but no one seems to have told him as he is flying own the left hand side even more than when he was a left wing-back. We know what he can do, he has scored lots of goals. He wants to stay high on the pitch and he's been a real success for them.\"\nIn fine company - the stats\nSarri has become the sixth manager to win his first four Premier League games in charge - after Jose Mourinho, Guus Hiddink, Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and Craig Shakespeare.\nThe Blues have won their first four games of a Premier League season for the sixth time, and the first time since 2014-15 under Mourinho.\nPedro has scored three goals in four Premier League games this season, having only managed two in his previous 23 appearances in the competition.\nNo player has been involved in more Premier League goals this season than Hazard (four - two goals, two assists).\nHazard has scored in all five of Chelsea's Premier League victories over Bournemouth.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host newly promoted Cardiff City next at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, 15 September (15:00 BST). At the same time, Bournemouth are at home to Leicester."

        "article_text": "Brighton recover to draw with Fulham\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton praised the character of his team as they fought back from a two-goal deficit to draw with Fulham.\nGlenn Murray struck twice in the second half as the Seagulls secured a point that seemed unlikely with 25 minutes remaining.\n\"To come from 2-0 down here and to show the character we did speaks volumes,\" Hughton said.\nHaving missed a penalty, and trailing to goals from Andre Schurrle and Aleksandar Mitrovic, Murray converted Anthony Knockaert's pass to initiate the fightback.\nThe forward then dispatched their second penalty of the afternoon with six minutes remaining after Mitrovic was penalised for controlling the ball with his arm in the Fulham area.\nPascal Gross had earlier missed a spot-kick for Brighton, with Fulham keeper Marcus Bettinelli turning his effort away.\n\"We lost momentum after we missed the first penalty,\" said Hughton. \"When you're 2-0 down you're always grateful for what you can get.\"\nSlavisa Jokanovic's side capitalised on their good fortune by going ahead when Schurrle scored from Jean Michael Seri's exquisite scooped pass.\nMitrovic's fourth goal in three games looked to have sealed all three points for the visitors and their first consecutive Premier League wins since April 2014.\nHowever, Brighton, who spurned several good opportunities, persevered to maintain an unbeaten home league record that now stretches back to January.\nThe outcome left both clubs in the position they had occupied at kick-off, the Cottagers 11th in the table and Brighton one place lower in 12th.\nMurray stars for resilient Brighton\nForm going into this game suggested it would be a contest between evenly matched sides, and so it proved as the hosts levelled the scores with six minutes remaining.\nManchester United (twice), Arsenal and Tottenham have all visited the Amex Stadium since Hughton's side last lost at home in the Premier League - a hefty 4-0 reverse to Chelsea - on 20 January.\nThat resilience had led to Hughton largely keeping faith with the players that ensured top-flight survival last season; of 10 summer signings only Spanish defender Martin Montoya made the starting XI.\nMurray was one of those key performers last season. He proved his worth again here in a performance just about running the fine line between combative and undisciplined as he scored for the second home league game in succession.\nHis nuisance value unnerved the visiting defenders throughout, winning Brighton's first penalty and almost adding to his tally of two goals on three other occasions.\nWhile his late foul on Seri was unwise when already on a booking, his contribution ultimately proved the difference between defeat and a valuable point.\nMitrovic takes centre stage\nAfter opening their campaign with consecutive defeats, Fulham looked to have adjusted to the demands of the Premier League with a 4-2 victory against Burnley in their previous outing.\nAnd that feeling was reinforced when they took a two-goal lead on the south coast, albeit slightly fortuitously.\nThe Cottagers spent more than \u00a3100m strengthening their squad in the summer, bringing 13 new players into a squad that earned promotion from the Championship last season.\nAnd key components of that summer recruitment spree all made an impact against Brighton.\nSeri, a \u00a325m addition from Nice, superbly created the opening goal for Schurrle before Mitrovic took centre stage.\nHis bustling presence drew a mistake from Brighton captain Lewis Dunk, enabling him to register his 16th league goal since his debut for the club in February - no striker has scored more during that period across the top four tiers of English football.\nHowever, his late aberration, controlling the ball with his arm while under little pressure in his penalty area, cost his team victory.\n\"He didn't need to ask for any apologies. I interpret it as bad luck, a mistake,\" said Fulham manager Jokanovic.\n\"I don't need to explain to him that he doesn't need to touch the ball in this situation. He's a strong enough lad to keep going, he made one mistake, OK.\n\"And from another side, he scored the goal, he was fighting really well, he played at the level like he started in the Premier League and I don't want to complain and point the finger at my player, I cannot find any sense (in doing so).\"\nMan of the match - Glenn Murray (Brighton)\nMatch of the Day pundit Martin Keown: \"Murray is pivotal to what Brighton do. He is what I call a contact striker. He's so physical and makes more fouls than anyone in the Premier League. He gets away with loads, bumps into people and always seems to get there first. So clever. He is their Harry Kane. He mugs defenders so well and I think it's about time he got the credit he deserves.\"\nThe stats - 'Brighton earn first points from two down'\nBrighton won points after going two goals down for the first time in the Premier League.\nFulham are without a win in their past six league matches with Brighton, drawing one and losing five.\nBrighton have been awarded 10 penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season (scoring seven), a joint-high along with Crystal Palace.\nBettinelli made his first penalty save in league competition since March 2015 against Huddersfield.\nSeri has recorded goal involvements in consecutive league games (assist v Brighton following a goal v Burnley) for the first time since December 2016 for Nice in Ligue 1.\nSchurrle has scored in consecutive Premier League games within a single season for the first time.\nSince his Fulham debut in February, Mitrovic has scored more goals in English league football than any other player (16).\nOnly Mohamed Salah (13) and Sergio Aguero (12) have scored more Premier League home goals in 2018 that Murray (8, level with Harry Kane).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel across the south coast to face Southampton in their next Premier League encounter on 17 September (20:00 BST).\nMeanwhile, Fulham visit Manchester City on 15 September (15:00 BST) on their return to top-flight action."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-2 Southampton: Saints secure first league win of season\nSouthampton boss Mark Hughes said his players had shown a \"real purpose\" after they secured their first win of the Premier League season with victory at Crystal Palace.\nDanny Ings, signed on loan from Liverpool in the summer, confidently netted his second goal of the campaign to put the visitors in front after being set up by Cedric Soares.\nSubstitute Charlie Austin, who scored the Saints' Carabao Cup winner against Brighton in midweek, had the chance to double the lead on 65 minutes but his weak penalty - after Aaron Wan-Bissaka's handball - was saved by Wayne Hennessey.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg added the second in stoppage time after the visitors, with two defeats and one point from their opening three matches, had to soak up concerted pressure in the closing stages.\nRelive the action as it happened\n\"The last two weeks, since the Everton defeat, I've seen a real purpose to everything we have done in terms of application and a desire to get points on the board,\" said Hughes.\n\"We were excellent today. We got our noses in front but we made it nervous towards the end. The penalty miss put us on edge and we just needed to calm ourselves down after that.\"\nPrior to Austin's penalty miss, James McArthur had gone close to equalising for the hosts - who were without the injured Wilfried Zaha - when his curling effort struck the crossbar.\nAt the other end, the brilliant Alex McCarthy - called up to the England squad this week - denied Palace striker Christian Benteke from close range after an earlier save from Luka Milivojevic's volley.\nSaints' victory was Hughes' first at Selhurst Park in six attempts as a Premier League manager, and condemned the Eagles to a third consecutive league defeat.\nRelief for Hughes as Saints get a win\nSouthampton arrived in south London having made a slow start to the season - a goalless draw with Burnley preceding consecutive defeats by Everton and Leicester.\nAnd, though there is perhaps no immediate concern, a team that ended last season hovering precariously above the relegation zone need to start showing signs of progress.\nBuoyed by their midweek win, Hughes' side took control of a first half that lacked any real quality, though Hennessey was alert on the occasions the energetic Ings and Shane Long did find a way through a well-drilled defence.\nSaints returned from the interval with confidence, and Ings' well-executed goal looked to have set the tone for the visitors, who pressed in pursuit of a second.\nBut Austin's penalty miss gave Palace momentum and caused concern for Hughes, whose side have lost 24 points from winning positions since the start of the 2017-18 season.\nAs it was, his players held firm to keep the hosts out, before Hojbjerg sealed the win.\n\"In the first half we were in total control of the game and should have been a few goals to the good,\" said Hughes.\n\"We had to withstand a little bit of pressure but, if we keep playing at the level we're at, we'll get breaks and win games.\"\nPalace struggle without Zaha\nZaha was a surprise omission from the Palace squad, with the club later revealing he had strained an abductor muscle in training on Friday.\nThat was five days after the 25-year-old became the Eagles' record Premier League goalscorer when he scored his 24th goal in the competition against Watford.\nWithout a player who had scored seven of their past nine league goals, Roy Hodgson's side failed to make a breakthrough against a resolute Saints defence.\nSince the start of last season, Palace have lost all 10 Premier League games in which Zaha has not featured.\n\"He didn't play and again we didn't win. It's a pure fact that we have to learn to live with,\" said Hodgson.\nSummer addition Jordan Ayew made his debut in place of Zaha, but it was Serbia international Milivojevic who went closest for the hosts in the first half with a lovely volleyed effort that McCarthy was equal to, before Benteke was denied a first goal from open play since January.\nIt is almost a year since Hodgson's appointment - the former England manager having replaced Dutchman Frank de Boer following a disastrous start to the season - and Palace have come a long way since.\nBut, having squandered numerous chances to level the match, they have now lost three league games in a row and will need to keep Zaha fit if they are to kick on this season.\n\"We shouldn't have got something out of the match,\" said Hodgson. \"I was hoping after the penalty save we would show spirit and fight. They did show endeavour to get the equaliser but, over the 90 minutes, Southampton were the better team and deserved it.\"\nMan of the match - Alex McCarthy (Southampton)\nThe Zaha effect - the stats\nHodgson's side failed to score in consecutive home league games for the first time under the former England manager.\nBenteke has scored three goals in his past 36 Premier League appearances for Palace, after scoring 15 in his 35 before that.\nSouthampton have won five of their past seven away league games against Palace, losing the other two.\nSaints have won two of their past three away matches in the Premier League, which is as victories as in their previous 18.\nIngs has scored in three consecutive away league appearances for the first time.\nHojbjerg scored his first Premier League goal in his 47th appearance in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nThe Premier League resumes in two weeks, following the first international break of the season.\nPalace travel to Huddersfield on Saturday, 15 September (15:00 BST), while Southampton are at Brighton on Monday, 17 September (20:00)."

I am not disappointed in the way we played. If you don't win a game then it is important to win the next one.\"\nLittle to smile about for Newcastle\nNewcastle's wretched form against City now stretches to 22 top-flight meetings without victory. They have lost their past 10 away from home against these opponents.\nThe north-east side were knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek by Championship side Nottingham Forest and already occupy one of the relegation spots in the Premier League.\nWith talk of unrest between manager Benitez and owner Mike Ashley - one report saying the two do not speak directly - and a training-ground row between captain Jamaal Lascelles and Matt Ritchie, it looks like being a difficult season for Newcastle.\nBenitez was criticised for his unadventurous approach in the loss to Chelsea in their previous league game, where they had just 19% possession, and they fared only slightly better with 21% against City.\nAnd as in the defeat at Stamford Bridge, they failed to hold out after equalising, with summer signing Rondon cutting an isolated figure for much of the game.\nDefeat could have been much worse had it not been for goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who stopped well from Gabriel Jesus and made an excellent double save to deny Fernandinho and David Silva.\nBenitez told BBC Sport: \"I am really pleased with the effort, mentality and team spirit. We were in the game for a while. We gave the ball away or the first and the second was a great goal.\n\"It is the same situation for us, we have to improve on the ball and we would have more chances against these teams.\n\"I am pleased to see the support of the fans and the way players were working. That is the main thing to have everyone together.\n\"We cannot be watching the table, it is too early. The main thing is the performance. We are not too far away, as soon as you start with a couple of victories you can go up.\"\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\nWhat next?\nThe teams are back in action after the international break. Manchester City host Fulham in the Premier League on Saturday, 15 September (kick-off 15:00 BST), while Newcastle play Arsenal at the same time.\nMendy's magic - the stats\nManchester City have won each of their past 10 Premier League home games against Newcastle, their joint-longest run of home wins against a single opponent in the top-flight (also 10 v Wolves between 1900 and 1937).\nNewcastle have registered just one win in their past 10 away Premier League games (D3 L6).\nManchester City hit the 750 mark for home Premier League goals in this game (160 at Maine Road and 590 at the Etihad).\nSince the start of last season, only Mohamed Salah (45) and Harry Kane (35) have had a hand in more Premier League goals than Sterling (31 - 20 goals, 11 assists).\nBenjamin Mendy is the third City player to assist as many as four goals in their first four games to a Premier League season, after Samir Nasri in 2011-12 and Silva in 2015-16.\nYedlin is the first American player to score in the Premier League since Geoff Cameron for Stoke v Aston Villa in March 2014.\nWalker scored his first goal for City in all competitions in his 52nd appearance for the club.\nAguero has been directly involved in 17 goals in 12 Premier League appearances against Newcastle (14 goals, 3 assists), more than against any other side."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 2-3 Arsenal: Gunners win through Alexandre Lacazette's late strike\nArsenal secured their first away win of the season as they edged a pulsating Premier League encounter with Cardiff City.\nAlexandre Lacazette's powerful late winner proved the difference in a contest full of attacking quality and defensive fragility.\nThe Gunners led twice, through Shkodran Mustafi's header and a curling effort from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, before Lacazette crashed home the winner on 81 minutes.\nVictor Camarasa's first Cardiff goal, on the stroke of half-time, and Danny Ward's header had seemed as though they would earn Neil Warnock's side a point as they scored their first goals of the league campaign.\nOzil returns as Emery picks two strikers\nArsenal manager Unai Emery this week denied reports that he had fallen out with midfielder Mesut Ozil after the former Germany international withdrew from the squad that beat West Ham last weekend, citing illness.\nThere have been suggestions Ozil's style does not fit with a manager who demands high-energy pressing from his forwards, but Ozil started in an attacking-looking line-up that paired Aubameyang with France striker Lacazette up top.\nOzil and former Cardiff favourite Aaron Ramsey were given licence to roam in behind, and for large periods in the first half, Arsenal's shape and roving full-backs troubled Cardiff.\nEmery's side took the lead on 11 minutes with a goal that will have left Warnock incredulous as Mustafi headed home, unopposed, from Granit Xhaka's corner.\nBut for a wonderful save from Neil Etheridge, who denied Nacho Monreal from point-blank range, the Gunners might have given Cardiff a mountain to climb inside 20 minutes.\nHowever, as always seems to be the way on the road - Arsenal came into this game having lost eight of their past nine away games - the Gunners allowed the hosts a way back in by failing to either extend their advantage or keeping their opponents out.\nThe first period especially was a game full of attacking intent and flimsy defensive resistance on both sides and Lacazette underlined the danger he posed when he rattled the inside of the post on 33 minutes as Arsenal streamed forward.\nEmery's men almost replicated their opening goal when Mustafi got a firm header to Xhaka's corner, but this time Etheridge repelled the danger.\nLacazette and Aubameyang struggled to find a rapport at times, but were perfectly in tune just past the hour mark when they combined beautifully to allow Aubameyang to curl home from just outside the area, his 150th goal in one of Europe's top five leagues.\nCardiff's quest for a goal is finally fruitful\nWhile Arsenal always catch the eye in attack, the Bluebirds had failed to score in their first three fixtures back in the top flight, extending their run to 1,597 days without a Premier League goal since Peter Whittingham's penalty on 19 April 2014 against Stoke City.\nThey probably feared more of the same when they spurned a golden opportunity inside 10 minutes, when midfielder Harry Arter shot over the crossbar despite being presented the ball by Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech. Arter also shot over in first-half stoppage time as Cardiff looked a little bereft of ideas in attack.\nWard was within an inch or so of turning home Bobby Dercordova-Reid's cross, while the former Bristol City forward also acrobatically volleyed over after Ward failed to find a convincing touch following Junior Hoilett's cross.\nIt seemed it was going to be yet another frustrating half for Cardiff, but Arsenal allowed more shots on target to the opposition in their first three games (24) than any other Premier League side and on the stroke of half-time, they let the hosts in.\nThe Gunners failed to deal with Joe Bennett's cross and summer signing Camarasa stole in between Mustafi and Monreal, twisting away from the latter and rifling the ball past Cech into the roof of the net.\nThe Bluebirds barely created even a half-chance in the second period with Arsenal again seizing the advantage, but they found a goal from nothing with 20 minutes remaining when Sean Morrison flicked on a free-kick and Ward crashed home a header off the inside of the post.\nIt set up a grandstand finish where both sides pushed to win the match, with Reid bursting clear and firing straight at Cech, before Lacazette's stunning finish ensured all three points would head back to north London when he escaped Sol Bamba's slack marking and thundered the ball in at the near post.\nMorrison's late header over the bar with Cech completely stranded almost provided even further drama, but Arsenal held on.\nMan of the match - Alexandre Lacazette\nGunners improve on the road - the stats\nArsenal have collected six points in their past three away Premier League games (W2 D0 L1), as many as in their previous 11 away games combined (W1 D3 L7).\nCardiff are winless in six matches in all competitions (D3 L3), their worst run under Warnock and worst since a run of eight in January and February 2015.\nSince his Premier League debut in February, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (15) has scored more Premier League goals than Aubameyang (11).\nCamarasa's goal for Cardiff ended a run of 415 minutes without scoring for the Bluebirds in league competition.\nAll six of Mustafi's Premier League goals have been scored via set-pieces (three from corners, three from free-kicks), with five of them headed goals.\nAubameyang's strike from outside the box ended his personal run of 76 consecutive goals from inside the box in club football - his last from outside the box before today was against Spurs for Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League in March 2016.\nLacazette has been directly involved in seven goals in his past five Premier League starts (5 goals, 2 assists).\nWard made his first Premier League start - 3,305 days after his first appearance in the competition for Bolton Wanderers in August 2009.\n'We are evolving' - what they said\nArsenal head coach Unai Emery speaking to Sky Sports: \"I enjoyed the win. In the 90 minutes it was difficult. I think we controlled the match not every time but 70% on the pitch with possession, positioning attacking movement. It's important to continue working.\n\"One goal for Lacazette, one for Aubameyang, but I think every other player worked well with commitment we want. We are happy for that and we are evolving.\"\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock speaking to Sky Sports: \"It's tough but I really enjoyed the game, it was a great game to watch from the sideline and I thought we were always in it.\n\"Top teams take their chances, there's a lot to work on but we didn't want to park the bus - we wanted the fans to enjoy it and I felt we gave them a good game here. We could've got a result really.\"\nWhat's next\nAfter the international break, Arsenal travel to St James' Park to face Newcastle. and Cardiff face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

We are in a good moment and trying to enjoy it, knowing we have won four games - but it is only four games.\"\nRelive Sunday's action as it happened\nTottenham's Son Heung-min avoids military service\nIn a first half of limited chances, England midfielder Dele Alli had the earliest opportunity for either side with a looping header that only momentarily concerned the back-pedalling Ben Foster, before Deeney headed over for the Hornets from Daryl Janmaat's inviting cross during a particularly quiet opening 20 minutes.\nHarry Kane, in particular, cut a frustrated figure for Spurs and it took until first-half stoppage time for either side to manage a shot on target - Deeney's weak long-range effort collected by Michel Vorm, stand-in for injured Spurs captain Hugo Lloris.\nBut the visitors found themselves ahead soon after the break, as Doucoure turned into his own net after Watford had failed to clear.\nDeeney led the charge as the Hornets looked to respond and saw his cross diverted on to the crossbar by Spurs defender Toby Alderweireld moments before levelling from the resulting corner.\nAnd it was another set-piece that allowed the Hornets to turn the game around on 76 minutes as defender Cathcart nestled a powerful header into the top corner of Vorm's goal to ensure Watford's best ever start to a Premier League season continues.\nGracia's men mean business\nWatford had already managed their best ever Premier League start by defeating Crystal Palace, Burnley and Brighton with relative ease, but they proved their position in the early league table was no fluke as they matched Tottenham stride for stride.\nThe Hornets, with six wins and just one defeat under manager Javi Gracia, boasted a home record second only to Liverpool heading into the weekend and demonstrated exactly why sides have found it so tough at Vicarage Road against a Spurs side buoyed by Monday's 3-0 win at Manchester United.\nThey kept the visitors at arm's length with few scares during a tight first half and were, on the balance of play, unfortunate to find themselves behind as Frenchman Doucoure deflected the ball beyond team-mate Foster.\nJose Holebas and Roberto Pereyra continued to display excellent understanding down the left flank, although it was skipper Deeney in particular who once again proved the inspiration to his side.\nIt was Deeney's unrelenting work-rate and willingness to chase the ball down that led to his equalising goal, which gave the Hornets the belief they needed as the momentum swung their way.\nIt is early days but the table does not mislead. This continues to be a brilliant start from Gracia's side.\n\"Four wins out of four is a huge achievement for a club of our size,\" said Deeney.\n\"We're not naive to think we're going to go on and win the league, we've got a lot to work on but we have an added boost and confidence from this result,\" he added.\nSpurs fail to build on 'massive' win\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino declared his side's impressive win over Manchester United \"a massive victory\", as his men swept the Old Trafford club aside with an unforgiving second-half performance.\nHowever, the visitors were unable to find their rhythm against Watford and failed to record a single shot on target in the opening 45 minutes - the first time that has happened to them in the Premier League since December 2017 against Manchester City.\nAnd Pochettino's side, who will begin a tough Champions League group stage against Barcelona, PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan following the first international break of the season, simply could not find a way to break down the home side's resolute defence as Christian Eriksen in particular was restricted to long-range attempts.\nTottenham made no signings during the summer transfer window, but Lucas Moura's encouraging start to the new campaign - including two goals on Monday night - may make Pochettino feel like he did, because the Brazilian, enjoying his first consistent run in the team with Son Heung-min away on international duty, was again by far Spurs' liveliest player.\nHe could not, however, prevent the end of their 100% record, and Pochettino's side, who began the day knowing a big enough win could take them top of the table, must make do with fifth place for now, a point behind champions Manchester City.\n\"We need to show more respect to this competition. It's difficult for me to understand after four years of us being contenders,\" said Pochettino.\n\"Today, from the beginning, we needed to go there like a lion. If you want to win you need to show that character,\" he added.\n\"Maybe you cannot play so well but you need to win this type of game if you want to be a contender at the end.\"\nMan of the match - Troy Deeney (Watford)\nWatford finally beat Tottenham - the stats\nThis was Watford's first league win over Tottenham since May 1987, ending a run of 12 league games without a victory over Spurs.\nWatford have won each of their opening four league games of a season for just the second time since 1988-89 and this is the first time they have done so in the Premier League.\nSince Gracia took over as Watford manager in January, no side has won more home Premier League games than the Hornets' seven - which is level with Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd and Tottenham.\nWatford's run of four consecutive Premier League wins at Vicarage Road is their best home run in the top-flight since December 1986 (also four straight wins).\nDeeney became the fourth player to score in 100 matches for Watford in all competitions, after Tommy Barnett, Ross Jenkins and Luther Blissett.\nHolebas has been directly involved in five Premier League goals so far this season - more than any other player in the competition.\nThis was the first time that Tottenham have lost a game they had been leading in the Premier League since November 2016, ending a run of 48 league matches without defeat when taking the lead at any stage.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Tottenham return to Premier League action against Liverpool on Saturday, 15 September (12:30 BST) while Watford host Manchester United later that day (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-2 Man Utd: United hold on to win after Marcus Rashford red card\nManchester United recovered from back-to-back defeats to beat Burnley despite Paul Pogba missing a penalty and Marcus Rashford being sent off.\nRomelu Lukaku scored twice in the first half as the Red Devils - beaten by Brighton and Tottenham in their previous two Premier League matches - were largely untroubled by their hosts.\nPogba had the chance to stretch United's lead midway through the second half but his penalty - after Aaron Lennon fouled Rashford - was saved by former Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart.\nAnd two minutes later the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Rashford was sent off for leaning into Burnley defender Phil Bardsley with his head.\nThat made the closing stages unnecessarily tense for Jose Mourinho's side, but the Clarets were unable to find a way through.\nVictory took United up to 10th in the table - level on points with Everton in seventh.\nUnited defenders keep it clean\nThe build-up to the match had been dominated by discussion of the Red Devils' stuttering start to the season. There had even been speculation Mourinho could be one game from being sacked.\n, external\nAnd the club's executive vice-chairman was the target of a banner that flew over the ground before kick-off reading 'Ed Woodward: A specialist in failure'.\nIf the United players were feeling the pressure, they did not show it during a thoroughly professional first-half performance.\nLukaku looked back to his clinical best when he rose highest to power home Alexis Sanchez's clipped cross after 27 minutes.\nAnd the Belgian reacted well for his second on the cusp of half-time, slamming the ball home after a series of kind deflections.\nBut, with the game stretched in the second half, he failed to complete a hat-trick - squandering the best chance after rounding Hart under pressure from Ben Mee.\nRashford, who had won the penalty shortly after coming on, then lost his cool in an altercation with Bardsley and was shown the first red card of his career.\nMore pleasingly for Mourinho, his defence - again changed from the previous match - looked solid, keeping United's first clean sheet of the season and a 10th in their past 11 visits to Turf Moor.\nBurnley's poor start continues\nA second home defeat of the season leaves Burnley 19th in the table with just one point taken from their opening four matches.\nThey offered little throughout, perhaps affected by their Europa League exit to Olympiakos on Thursday.\nEven after going behind, Sean Dyche's men seemed reluctant to attack United, and teenage winger Dwight McNeil had their only shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nDyche attempted to give his side more impetus by bringing on Sam Vokes on 58 minutes, and the Wales striker forced United goalkeeper David de Gea into two good saves.\nBut the Spaniard was not tested enough and Burnley are now without a league win in nine games, a run stretching back to April, meaning they are on the longest winless run of any side in the competition.\nThe international break gives them a chance to regroup, while their exit from the Europa League at least allows them to focus solely on domestic matters.\nBut Dyche will not be looking forward to January's return fixture - after eight attempts, he is yet to beat Mourinho in the Premier League.\nMan of the match - Nemanja Matic\n'Marcus is a naive boy' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho speaking to BBC Sport: \"Burnley played very well as a team, and there were very good individual performances and we should score many more goals. The result shouldn't have been open until the last minute.\"\nOn Pogba's penalty miss: \"I never blame a player for missing penalties. I blame the ones who refuse to go up there. Paul's scored some good ones for us.\"\nOn Rashford's red card: \"I don't know what happened. I would say it was naive. It was a kid and a very experienced man. Bardsley's been in the game for 20 years and Marcus is a naive boy.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport: \"Disappointment is quickly thought about in the same process as the reality. Manchester United are a very good side - they started hard and fast with the ball and defended strong.\n\"Sometimes there is balance to the disappointment. We got about them - the goal on half-time is a sickener for us. I thought Lukaku was excellent. It's a strange one because we come out of a useful period for experience but a tough period.\"\nClarets struggle against United - the stats\nBurnley have won just one of their past 18 top-flight meetings with United (D8 L9), with that victory coming in their first Premier League meeting back in August 2009 (1-0).\nMourinho has won each of his four Premier League games at Turf Moor (P4 W4), including all three in charge of the Red Devils.\nUnited have won each of their past 24 Premier League matches in which they have scored the opening goal.\nLukaku scored his first Premier League double for United since August 2017, when he did so on his debut in the competition for the Red Devils (v West Ham in a 4-0 win).\nRashford became the first substitute to be sent off for the Red Devils in the Premier League since Marouane Fellaini against Hull City in May 2015.\nAt the age of 18 years and 284 days, McNeil became the first teenager to start a Premier League game for the Clarets.\nFellaini made his 250th Premier League appearance in this game. The only other Belgian to make as many is Vincent Kompany (251).\nWhat's next\nAfter the international break, United travel to Vicarage Road to face Watford on Saturday, 15 September (17:30 BST). Burnley face Wolves at Molineux the following day (13:30 BST)."

I didn't take that for granted.\n\"We were defensively good, offensively good, and the performance was better than the result. It was perhaps a bit nervy at the end but no problem. I have nothing to be critical about today. If you win games and you're not 100% with the performance it's still three points - I like that. It's a deserved result.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said: \"I am not disappointed - the game showed how competitive the Premier League is and we played a really good team who started very well.\n\"In the second half we made mistakes but we were pushing. The goals we conceded came from our own mistakes, but I am calm.\n\"After we beat Manchester United at Old Trafford I said we still need to improve, and I'm still saying that.\"\nAnalysis: 'Klopp turning doubters into believers'\nLiverpool's Firmino 'OK' after eye 'scare'\nFollow reaction to the game here\nLiverpool's powerful statement\nLiverpool's title ambitions have been clear since the arrival of expensive summer acquisitions such as \u00a367m goalkeeper Alisson from Roma to top up other new signings Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri, as well as the \u00a375m purchase of defender Virgil van Dijk in January.\nThe expectations have been heightened by those four straight wins but a trip to face Spurs at Wembley, where they were well beaten 4-1 last season, was regarded by many as the acid test of those aspirations.\nThey answered in the most positive manner possible and confirmed their growing status as the team most likely to topple reigning champions Manchester City.\nTrue, Spurs were astonishingly lethargic but it would be unfair to remove credit from Liverpool on the basis of the home side's performance.\nThe Reds were more vibrant, dangerous and energetic from the first whistle and moments of discomfort when they were not in control were few and far between.\nThe imperious Van Dijk ruled at the back, Liverpool were dominant in midfield and the pace of Mane and the guile of Firmino were simply too much for Spurs.\nSloppy Spurs suffer in the sun\nSpurs looked like they had recorded a landmark win when they went to Manchester United and came away with a convincing 3-0 victory.\nIt looked like the sort of statement Pochettino had been seeking - but how the tables have turned since that night at Old Trafford.\nSpurs conceded a lead to lose at Watford and to be brutal they were a very serious second best to Liverpool at Wembley.\nPochettino was without injured goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, particularly expensive given Vorm's uncertainty, and Dele Alli - but so many aspects of this performance will have disappointed the demanding Spurs manager.\nSpurs looked exhausted and off the pace almost from the first whistle, second to everything, and to see his side look so leg-weary and drained so early in the season will concern Pochettino.\nOf course it is early days and far too soon to be raising serious questions about Spurs but the manner in which they were so completely outmanoeuvred by a team they will rightly regard as close rivals was ominous at times.\nIt could be that Spurs are suffering a hangover from the World Cup as seven of their starting line-up were involved until the semi-final stage.\nAnd, of course, it may have been a very bad off-day.\nPochettino will hope it is the latter after a day of suffering in the Wembley sun for Spurs.\nUnderrated Firmino exerts his influence\nLiverpool's attacking trio of Firmino, Mane and Mohamed Salah have had a devastating impact on the Premier League and Champions League after Klopp brought them together at the start of last season.\nTheir combination of pace, movement and firepower has wreaked havoc ever since in a manner which strikes fear into the heart of the best defences.\nSalah was subdued again but Mane's blistering pace was a constant danger and Firmino's subtle touches and work-rate were a standout.\nThe Brazilian made a slightly slow start to the season but he has now contributed what proved to be the winning goals in successive away wins at Leicester City and now Spurs.\nHe has an impact in all areas of the pitch, whether it is scoring from virtually standing on the line to chasing back to near his own corner flag to help with defensive duties.\nFirmino is a class all-rounder and it is easy to see why Klopp rates him so highly.\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino\nWijnaldum's first away goal- the stats\nLiverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum's opener was the 19th Premier League goal of his career but the first to come in an away game\nHis goal came from his 55th shot attempted in away Premier League games\nTottenham faced 10 shots on target in a Premier League home game for the first time since January 2014 v Manchester City\nChristian Eriksen's assist for Erik Lamela's goal was his 50th in the Premier League, making him the second player to reach that milestone for Spurs (Darren Anderton, 67)\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool open their Champions League campaign on Tuesday at home to Paris St-Germain (20:00 BST), before facing Southampton at Anfield the following Saturday (15:00 BST).\nTottenham face Inter Milan at the San Siro in their Champions League opener on Tuesday (17:55 BST), they then play Brighton at the Amex Stadium on Saturday (17:30 BST)."

It is important he scored. I want not only for him to assist, we need him to go in the box and score like today,\" said Emery - who had challenged the midfielder to \"do more\" before the game.\n\"I see the players are the same, each has quality. I will work with every player and continue our process to create the team as we want.\"\nSaturday's Premier League action as it happened\nHow the action unfolded at St James' Park\nMeanwhile, Rafael Benitez's side remain on one point, equalling their worst return after five Premier League games - although they had much the better of the first-half chances as they pressed an Arsenal defence determined to build from the back.\nThe early pressure forced errors, as keeper Petr Cech passed the ball out for a corner and defender Shkodran Mustafi's stumble was indicative of an Arsenal back-line still trying to get comfortable with a new style of play under Emery.\nHowever, Arsenal returned the stronger side after the interval and scored twice in 10 second half minutes to secure the points - despite a late Newcastle rally.\nArsenal build momentum under Emery\nFollowing a tough start to Emery's reign, with opening league fixtures against champions Manchester City and Chelsea, victory at St James' Park is the Gunners third consecutive win and they now appear to be gaining some momentum under Arsene Wenger's successor.\nArsenal, who managed to see off a resurgent Cardiff prior to the international break, knew they would face a stern test against a Newcastle side that had adopted a defensive approach against Chelsea and Manchester City already this season - and were unable to settle into the match as the hosts pressed from the start.\nNewcastle's first-half approach demonstrated exactly how to disrupt Arsenal's play under Emery, and both Cech and Mustafi in particular appeared hesitant on the ball under repeated pressure.\nBut the Gunners were able to take control of the game as the hosts' early energy faded - although it took Xhaka's sublime strike on 49 minutes to really give the visitors confidence.\nArsenal looked increasingly comfortable following Ozil's cool finish and were able to see the game out despite Clark's late reply as Emery's side continued to amend a poor recent away league record that had seen them lose eight of their last 10 prior to kick-off.\nAnd it did appear, once they got into their stride, that Arsenal's players are adapting to Emery's philosophy - although on evidence there remains plenty of work to do.\n\"We are improving. We need to continue working individually and collectively to improve more things. In the first half we didn't control like we wanted but the second half we were better and the victory is just,\" said Spaniard Emery.\n\"We need to improve and score more individually. We need to work, every player - not only the attacking players but the midfielders and centre-backs from set-pieces.\"\nPositives to take for winless Newcastle\nBenitez's side have been dealt a difficult opening league fixture list this season, having already faced Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester City and now the Gunners - with only a point against Cardiff to show for their efforts.\nIn search of a first victory, the manager made four changes to the side that suffered defeat by City prior to the international break, as Jacob Murphy, Matt Ritchie, Isaac Hayden and Joselu were introduced.\nBoth Murphy and Joselu proved worthy additions as, along with Perez, the home side went about forcing Arsenal into errors in front of a home crowd encouraged by Newcastle's desire to get forward.\nIn previous games against Chelsea and Manchester City, the Magpies had as little as 19 and 21% possession but - despite falling to a fourth 2-1 defeat by a 'big six' side - there was a definite change in approach as the home side sensed mistakes in the opposition defence.\nHowever Benitez's side tired from their early exertions and were unable to have the same impact on the match in the second half as Xhaka's moment of quality forced them to chase a result - leaving more space for the Gunners to play.\nThe winless start must, obviously, be seen in the context of who the Magpies have faced but, as the schedule begins to look more favourable, Benitez will know results must come quickly for his side, who remain in the relegation places.\n\"We did really well in the first half. The feeling was we could get something, then we conceded an early goal - two moments of quality and it is difficult for us. The first half we were creating and pushing but you have to take your chances,\" said Benitez.\n\"That's what happens when you have quality like they do, it is difficult for anyone. To react against a good team, you have to attack and push higher and you are more exposed.\n\"It is a pity, still we are scoring and having chances. We knew it could be like that, it is tough. Where we are, we have to keep the belief the same way we did last season.\"\nMan of the match - Alexandre Lacazette\nXhaka's threat from range - the stats\nAll four of Granit Xhaka's Premier League goals for Arsenal have been from outside the box.\nXhaka's opener was in fact Arsenal's first goal from a direct free-kick since Alexis Sanchez's strike against Middlesbrough in April 2017.\nAnd all 10 of Arsenal's Premier League goals this season have been scored by different players - including one own goal.\nThe Gunners have opened the scoring in each of their last 11 Premier League games against Newcastle.\nBut Arsenal have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their first five games to a top-flight season since the 1988-89 campaign.\nOne point from five games represents Newcastle's joint-worst start to a Premier League campaign, matching their start in 1999.\nIn four Premier League games against Newcastle, Arsenal's Mesut Ozil has had a hand in four goals - scoring three.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Crystal Palace next Saturday (15:00 BST), while Arsenal's Europa League campaign begins at the Emirates on Thursday night against Ukrainian side Vorskla (20:00 BST).\nThe Gunners then host Everton on Sunday (16:00 BST)."

We're aware of the table - we were aware of it last year when we had no points after four games.\"\nRelive today's action\nReaction to the rest of the day's matches\nBournemouth had mostly looked comfortable until Leicester's belated resurgence, although Asmir Begovic produced a brilliant double save to deny Jamie Vardy and James Maddison while the score was only 1-0.\nBut the late goals flattered Claude Puel's side, who slip back to ninth after a second consecutive defeat.\nFraser's first goal was a curling shot around Kasper Schmeichel's left hand from outside the box, and his second a poke through the Leicester keeper's legs.\nRicardo Pereira's handball gave King the chance to extend the lead from the spot, and Fraser was involved again when his pull-back set up Smith to score on his 100th Premier League appearance.\nWhat a difference a year makes for Cherries\nOn this date in 2017 Bournemouth were going into their fifth Premier League game of the season at the foot of the table after four straight defeats.\nA 2-1 win over Brighton that day saw them move in the right direction; this victory 12 months later puts Eddie Howe's side among exalted company.\nWhile Fraser's two goals will get a lot of the attention, important contributions from King and fellow striker Callum Wilson also played their part in an impressive performance.\nKing made the most of uncertainty in the Leicester defence to feed Fraser for the first goal, while Wilson allowed the ball to bounce over him before a precise pass to his Scottish team-mate for Fraser's second.\nThe Cherries seemed destined for their first clean sheet since the opening-day victory over Cardiff, and the sloppy way they conceded twice to seemingly well-beaten opponents with 10 men will annoy Howe.\nBut games against Burnley, Crystal Palace and Watford before the next international break offer Howe's side the chance to maintain their good start to the season.\nIndiscipline costs Foxes\nHarry Maguire's yellow card after just 12 minutes put the Foxes' England international defender on the back foot, before Morgan went into referee Craig Pawson's book for the first time just before the break.\nBy that point, the home fans, players and coaching staff had been baying for Maguire to be dismissed when he body-checked King in front of the home dugout.\nAnd while Leicester were unlucky to be denied an equaliser by Begovic's brilliance, they can only blame themselves for giving their hosts the chance to get so far ahead.\nTrying to pull the game back was difficult enough even before Morgan's dismissal for a second bookable offence, and while their goals set nerves fluttering in the home support, they did not seriously threaten to snatch a point.\nMan of the match - Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth)\nCherries' fine run against Foxes continues - the key stats\nBournemouth are unbeaten in their seven Premier League meetings with Leicester (W2 D5). They've faced Leicester more often without losing in the Premier League than they have any other side.\nThe Cherries have lost just two of their past 13 Premier League games at the Vitality Stadium, winning seven and drawing four.\nLeicester have lost five of their past six Premier League away games, winning the other versus Southampton.\nBournemouth striker Joshua King both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career.\nFoxes defender Wes Morgan was shown his second red card in the Premier League and first since December 2014 vs Liverpool.\nBournemouth have scored three first-half goals in a Premier League game for only the second time (since October 2016 v Hull).\nRyan Fraser scored his second ever double in the Premier League and first since December 2017 vs Everton.\nFraser had a hand in three goals in a single Premier League game for the first time (two goals, one assist).\nWhat the managers said:\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We're delighted with the result. We were very effective. I felt we dealt with the physicality well and were efficient in front of goal.\n\"Without wishing players to be sent off I thought Harry Maguire should have had a second yellow (for a foul on Joshua King).\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"It was a tough afternoon. It was strange, not a fair reflection. It was a good start from us, we had quality on the pitch and we also had chances to score.\n\"Then in two moments of counter-attack, we've conceded two goals.\nOn Wes Morgan's red card: \"We have had a difficult decision against us. The first foul, for me, was from the opponent as he pushed Wes. [For the second yellow] He tried to recover the ball. It's not an excuse, but it was a difficult decision against a good team.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth face Eddie Howe's former club Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, 22 September at 15:00 BST, while Leicester will host Huddersfield Town at the same time."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield 0-1 Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha leads Palace to victory at Huddersfield\nWilfried Zaha produced a moment of brilliance on his return to the team as Crystal Palace earned their second win of the season against Huddersfield.\nHalfway through September is far too early to be labelling matches six-pointers, but this was an encounter with a fiery edge to it from the start.\nIt looked as though it might be a frustrating afternoon for Zaha, who missed Palace's defeat to Southampton before the international break with a groin injury, after he was booked for a late tackle on Florent Hadergjonaj.\nThat foul was a reaction to being hauled to the ground by Mathias Jorgensen, but Zaha regained his composure and in the 38th minute knocked the ball between two defenders before smashing past Jonas Lossl.\nThe hosts offered a threat in the second half, flooding the Palace box with high crosses, and Aaron Mooy came close to finding the equaliser only to see his well-struck volley clatter off a post.\nHuddersfield's wait for their first win of the season continues but Palace move up to 11th in the table.\nI'm getting different treatment - Zaha\nHow the match unfolded\nReaction to all of Saturday's games\nZaha papers over Palace's defensive cracks\nThe 25-year-old Ivorian has scored 75% of Palace's goals in the Premier League this season, and his third of the campaign only emphasised his importance to this side.\nOn another day Palace could have found themselves behind before their talisman took centre stage, as Huddersfield delivered 23 crosses into the Palace box from open play.\nHad the hosts been more clinical, their wait for a first victory might now be over.\nSteve Mounie in particular was a constant aerial threat for Huddersfield, and the Benin international had the best chance to open the scoring in the early exchanges, his header from close range sailing over the bar.\nDavid Wagner's men had four headed efforts at goal, and Philip Billing's side-foot finish from a nod down found the net only to be ruled out for a foul in the area.\nPalace looked nervy at the back and appeared bereft of leadership all afternoon, but in Zaha they have an invaluable get-out-of-jail-free card.\nGoals remain a problem for the Terriers\nHuddersfield boss Wagner admitted after the game that goals are \"something we have to work on\" - but that is an understatement.\nThe West Yorkshire club have failed to score in 24 of their last 43 Premier League games - the most of any club.\nThe hosts will be buoyed by their second-half performance after having more than twice the number of efforts on goal than their opponents could manage - 15 against seven - but two goals from six games in all competitions is a major cause for concern.\nThe best of their chances fell to Mooy, whose well-struck volley showcased excellent technique but agonisingly found the post, while Hadergjonaj's low strike moments later lacked the conviction to trouble Wayne Hennessey.\nWagner's men exposed a weakness in the Palace defence from high balls but they failed to capitalise on the visitors' hesitancy, and this must go down as a golden opportunity spurned to take all three points.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\n'If we perform like we did we know we will get points' - what they said\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"You don't always get what you deserve. This was our best performance of the season. We created so many good opportunities. We absolutely dominated the control of the game but didn't use our opportunities and were unlucky for sure.\n\"Performance-wise it was very good but the result of course, is frustrating. If we perform like we did again then we know we will get the points.\n\"They had one magic moment from Wilfried Zaha but we should have defended better. In the last three games we have looked very solid and like we can create something, but the mood is frustration at the minute.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"We played well throughout the game but as you go into that last 15 minutes with a one-goal margin you are always worried. We had a stroke of fortune when their shot hit the post but we controlled the game. We have a win and that is the most important thing.\"\nOn Zaha: \"He was a constant threat. I thought he was close to scoring more than one goal. But it is nice that he is the match-winner and that is was such a good goal. I am sure it will be one of the better goals of the week.\"\nThe away side prevail again - the stats\nThe away team has won all three of the Premier League meetings between Huddersfield and Crystal Palace, making it the fixture with the best 100% record for away team victories in the competition's history.\nHuddersfield are without a win in nine Premier League games (D4 L5), their longest run without a victory in league football since September 2015 (10).\nCrystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has netted eight goals in his last 10 Premier League games, as many as in his previous 44.\nSince the start of last season, Crystal Palace have averaged 1.5 points per game when Zaha has played (33 games), compared to no points when he has been involved (10 games).\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace host Newcastle on Saturday, 22 September (15:00 BST), while Huddersfield travel to Leicester City at the same time."

But now I am changing my mind as maybe now he is the best in Europe.\"\nRelive Chelsea's win against Cardiff City\nSaturday's victory means Chelsea have started a Premier League season with five successive wins for the fourth time, and first since 2010.\nDefeat for Cardiff extends their winless run to six games, their worst spell since Neil Warnock was appointed manager in October 2016.\nThey started well at Stamford Bridge, and deserved the lead given to them by Bamba, but Chelsea's quality ultimately shone through.\nThe Blues have five points more than at this stage last season, but Sarri still wants his side to improve as they prepare for a busy two weeks during which they face second-placed Liverpool twice - in the league and EFL Cup.\nHe said: \"I am very happy with my players. But I always think we can do better. We are very dangerous in the offensive phase but we aren't as solid defensively as I want. I think we can improve quickly, though.\n\"I think at the moment Liverpool and Manchester City are another step up, so we have to improve, and I hope next season we can be on the same level.\"\nHazard shows his class\nChelsea came into the game in much the better form, but it was Cardiff who dominated the early stages - much to the hosts' frustration.\nBut, after Bamba's opener, Hazard changed the game with a low 37th-minute strike and doubled his tally with a heavily deflected shot after Olivier Giroud did well to lay the ball to his team-mate.\nThe Belgian wrapped up his hat-trick late on to seal victory for a Chelsea side who rarely looked in danger of conceding in the second half.\nAfter goals against Newcastle and Bournemouth, as well as against Scotland during the international break, Hazard has scored six goals in his past four games.\nHe had appeared to be on the verge of leaving Chelsea in the summer after six years with the club, but new boss Maurizio Sarri is getting the best out of him.\nAnd his performance meant Chelsea did not need to rely on a late goal - as they had against Arsenal, Newcastle and Bournemouth.\nBluebirds' winless run continues\nWhile Chelsea look down on the rest, Cardiff will be frustrated the scoreline at Stamford Bridge did not reflect what was a spirited performance.\nTheir poor run represents a change in form for a side promoted last season against the odds - and a new challenge for Warnock in the Welsh capital.\nHaving proved the doubters wrong last season, Cardiff have gone into this campaign with much of the side remaining the same - and there has been little to suggest they can get upward momentum.\nThe Bluebirds have scored just three goals from their opening five games, and Bobby Reid - signed from Bristol City in the summer - only once looked a threat to the Chelsea backline before he was substituted.\nThere is no doubt Warnock has transformed the club, but Cardiff need a Premier League win - and soon.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nA fine start for Chelsea - the stats\nChelsea have won their opening five games of a Premier League season for the fourth time - after 2005-06, 2009-10 and 2010-11 - more than any other team.\nThis is the first time since 1921-22 that Cardiff have opened an English top-flight season without winning any of their first five games.\nWarnock has gone 11 Premier League games without a win as manager for the first time (W0 D5 L6).\nCardiff are winless in seven matches in all competitions (W0 D3 L4), their worst run under Warnock; they last went on a longer run without victory between January and February 2015 (eight games).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2012, Hazard (115) has been directly involved in more goals than any other midfielder in the competition (74 goals, 41 assists).\nHazard is the fourth player to score more than one Premier League hat-trick for Chelsea (also Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink).\nBamba became the oldest player to score his first Premier League goal (33y 244d) since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in August 2016 (34y 316d).\nGiroud provided two assists in a single Premier League game for the third time in his career and first since January 2017 against Bournemouth.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea's Europa League campaign begins on Thursday as they travel to Greece to face PAOK Salonika (17:55 BST). They then play West Ham away in the Premier League on 23 September (13:30 BST).\nCardiff's next game is at home against reigning champions Manchester City on 22 September (15:00 BST)."

Sometimes he has to realise what, like a professional, he has to do.\n\"I am delighted for his performance and so confident.\"\nCity were rarely troubled by the newly promoted Cottagers, restricting the visitors to handful of half chances at Etihad Stadium.\nThe hosts, perhaps with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League opener against Lyon, eased off the pace in the second half but could have added to their lead with a number of opportunities falling to substitute Gabriel Jesus.\nReaction to all of Saturday's games\nSane starts as Silvas star\nSane enjoyed a glittering season as Manchester City won the title last term, scoring 10 goals and proving one of Guardiola's main attacking outlets, but he has been restricted to a spot on the bench so far this campaign.\nIt took the winger, who also surprisingly missed out on a place in Germany's World Cup squad in the summer, less than two minutes to find the net on his return.\nThe hosts punished Fulham's Jean Michael Seri for giving the ball away in midfield as Fernandinho broke forward and teed up 22-year-old Sane inside the six-yard-box.\nIt was the quickest Premier League goal of the season so far and the culmination of a good few days for Sane, who said after the game he became a father this week.\nCity's only dropped points this season came at newly promoted Wolves but, having not lost at home to a promoted team in 11 years, they were always in complete control against Fulham and doubled the lead on 20 minutes.\nBernardo Silva's good work down the left was eventually finished off by David Silva's half volley that struck the bar on its way in - it was the Spaniard's 50th Premier League goal, becoming the fifth City player to reach that landmark after Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Carlos Tevez and Edin Dzeko.\nSterling had also hit the bar in the first half as he and Sane caused problems out wide, but the England forward got his reward for a strong performance within two minutes of the restart as he tapped in from Aguero's low cross.\nLearning curve for Fulham\nFulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic said before the match that while his side wanted to use \"similar weapons\" to City, they must follow their own style of football.\nThe visitors brought two attacking full-backs into their line-up with Cyrus Christie on the right and teenager Ryan Sessegnon, often utilised as a winger, making his first start as a left-back since before Christmas.\nBut that left Fulham's central defenders exposed, with City exploiting the space left behind by 18-year-old Sessegnon as Aguero set up Sterling with a low cross from the right for City's third.\nFulham, promoted via the play-offs last season, looked threatening in the rare spells they were able to bring wide forwards Andre Schurrle and Luciano Vietto into the game, with World Cup winner Schurrle forcing a smart save from Ederson in the first half.\nHowever, prolific forward Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has scored 24 goals for club and country in 2018, remained isolated and was restricted to only one shot on target from long range late in the second half.\nIt was another lesson for Fulham following their return to top-flight football, with the Cottagers having now conceded 12 goals in five games - the worst defensive record in the division.\nMan of the match - Bernardo Silva (Manchester City)\n'It could have been more than three'\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It could have been more than three goals, considering the chances we created.\n\"After an international break it's always a mystery how you'll come back, and Fulham asked us a lot of questions. They will have a good season and I want to give Fulham a lot of credit.\n\"But we were aggressive when we had the ball and we created chances. Today we had many, many clear chances to score and we need to work at scoring more.\n\"I believe in all the guys in my squad - Sane, for example, is only 22 and he realises why he hasn't played many minutes. But he did well today.\"\nFulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: \"We started both halves conceding early goals. The result was fair and if you don't perform perfectly it's so hard to do well against Manchester City.\n\"Our performance was a little shy and we didn't connect our play well enough. We had some moments in the game when we enjoyed possession but we didn't have end quality.\"\nThe stats - Man City extend run against newly promoted sides\nManchester City have now won six consecutive Premier League matches against a single London team for the first time ever.\nThis is Fulham's second-worst start to a Premier League campaign after five games (four points, -5 goal difference) - only bettering 2011/12, when they had three points.\nManchester City are unbeaten in the Premier League against newly promoted sides in their last 34 home meetings, since losing to Reading 2-0 in 2007.\nFulham have won none of their last 10 Premier League meetings with reigning champions, drawing two and losing eight.\nLeroy Sane has had a hand in 18 goals in his last 16 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium (six goals, 12 assists).\nOnly Sergio Aguero (68) has scored more goals in all competitions for Manchester City under Pep Guardiola than Raheem Sterling (36).\nWhat's next?\nCity begin their Champions League campaign at home to Lyon on Wednesday, kick-off 20:00 BST, before visiting Cardiff in the Premier League on Saturday, 15:00.\nFulham, meanwhile, host Watford in Saturday's early kick-off."

But we had the experience also here last season where they don't give up and when the game is open they believe.\"\nThe result leaves Watford fourth, while United climb to eighth.\nAs it happened - Watford v United\nPogba the heartbeat for United\nThe Hornets had the better of the opening 20 minutes, Troy Deeney forcing a superb save from David de Gea, but United grew in confidence immeasurably after their quick-fire double strike.\nLukaku's fourth league goal of the season came in bizarre fashion as he turned home Young's cross with his lower chest.\nIn contrast, Smalling showed the technique and poise of a seasoned striker to bring down Fellaini's knock-down on his chest and volley into the roof of the net.\nHowever, while Belgium midfielder Fellaini was involved in both goals, it was a Frenchman who was United's heartbeat.\nOn his 100th appearance for the club, Paul Pogba played with real confidence - testing Foster twice from distance in the first half, before being brilliantly denied on the brink of half-time.\nAlexis Sanchez also impressed and did have the ball in the net on 24 minutes, only for his effort to be ruled out for offside, but United were made to work for the win in the second half as Watford grew into the game.\nSanchez and second-half substitute Anthony Martial both had opportunities to make the result safe in late counter-attacks as Watford pressed for an equaliser, but fine interventions by Craig Cathcart and Christian Kabasele denied them.\nHowever, United were not made to pay for those missed chances, as their backline stood firm to close out a hard-earned win and three points.\nWatford's perfect run comes to an end\nIt was always going to be difficult for Watford to carry the momentum built during their first four matches over the international break, and that proved to be the case.\nDespite a promising opening for the hosts, which saw Abdoulaye Doucoure strike at goal after just three minutes, United's first-half goals dampened the Hornets' spirit.\nTheir central midfield pairing of Doucoure and Etienne Capoue were overrun by United's midfield three in the first half, which left Deeney and Gray starved of service.\nBut, with the game stretched in the second period, Watford were able to get the ball to their creative players more often, meaning the likes of Will Hughes and Roberto Pereyra were able to influence the game.\nAnd it was Doucoure who created Watford's goal, as after a well-worked move he was able to find an unmarked Gray, who applied an emphatic finish to score his second of the campaign.\nThe Hornets spent much of the remainder of the game camped in United's half, applying relentless pressure, although chances were still hard to come by.\nBut De Gea kept out another Doucoure long-range effort, and then pulled off a trademark spectacular save from Kabasele's header deep into injury time.\nMan of the match - Marouane Fellaini\n'I am sorry we don't have a camera in our dressing room' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"With this win we keep the same points as Spurs and Arsenal. We have that distance of four and six points to the other top teams - if we don't win this match obviously that distance goes a little more.\n\"They are a good team, they know how to create problems to the top teams. And I told the players at half-time - sometimes I am sorry we don't have a camera in the dressing room because I told them what exactly happened - that it could be a match to win four or five nil, or to be in real trouble. In the second half we decreased our intensity, then the goal happened, then the game is open.\"\nWatford boss Javi Gracia on BBC Sport: \"We were much better in the second half than in the first. United played better in the first half; they created more chances and had more possession. In the second we were able to take a step forward to have more possession and to create more chances. In the last seconds we had two good chances to score. Today we don't get the points but I can be proud of the second half.\n\"In the first half we conceded two goals, after that the game was tough, we needed to press higher. We suffered some difficult situations, but we had to try and score two goals. It was a pity.\"\nLukaku's happy hunting ground - the stats\nAll three of Romelu Lukaku's Premier League goals against Watford have been at Vicarage Road.\nThe Belgium striker has scored three and assisted two in six Premier League appearances versus Watford.\nManchester United have been shown a red card in consecutive league games for the first time since September 2014.\nRomelu Lukaku has scored 20 goals in 39 Premier League apps for Manchester United; only three players have reached 20 goals for the Red Devils in fewer games than the Belgian - Ruud van Nistelrooy (26), Robin van Persie (32) and Dwight Yorke (34).\nWatford have lost 13 of their last 14 matches against Manchester United in league competition, with their solitary win coming at Vicarage Road in September 2016 (3-1).\nJose Mourinho has won six of his seven Premier League encounters with Watford (one loss), including each of the past four.\nChris Smalling has ended up on the winning side in all 11 Premier League games in which he has scored, the joint-best such record in the competition (also 11 games for Ryan Babel).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a trip to Switzerland to face Young Boys (20:00 BST), before hosting Wolves at Old Trafford on Saturday 22 September (15:00 BST).\nWatford are next in action when they travel to Fulham on the same day (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-0 Burnley: Raul Jimenez goal helps Wolves beat Burnley\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said his team are \"in a bit of a fog\" after defeat by Wolves at Molineux left them still waiting for their first league win of the season.\nWolves dominated large periods of the first half, and Raul Jimenez deservedly opened the scoring on the hour mark as he turned in Matt Doherty's cross.\nThe visitors rarely threatened, with the only real chances they created falling to Johann Berg Gudmundsson late on.\nDefeat for the Clarets means they have equalled a club record run of four consecutive Premier League losses and now sit bottom of the table, while promoted Wolves have climbed to ninth.\n\"Attacking-wise we were nowhere near enough,\" Dyche said.\n\"We are in a bit of a fog at the moment. Collectively we need to get out of it. You have to work to change it, so that's the key.\n\"But we have been down this road before and we've managed, along with the players, to pull out of the fog.\"\nDominant Wolves deserved more\nIn his pre-match news conference, Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo called for his players to \"maintain the standards\" set in their 1-0 victory over West Ham, and he was not disappointed.\nLast season's Championship winners were by far the brighter team throughout, putting Burnley under sustained periods of heavy pressure either side of the break.\nThey should have gone ahead on the half-hour mark when first Joe Hart superbly denied Jimenez, before James Tarkowski cleared the Mexico striker's second effort off the line.\nMoments later, Tarkowski was again alert to clear Jonny Otto's effort after Hart had palmed clear a low cross, and the former England keeper was then quickly out to smother Doherty's sliding effort from close range.\nAfter Jimenez finally found the net midway through the second half, the home side only got stronger, largely thanks to the introduction of Adama Traore after 66 minutes, his pace causing a tiring Burnley backline problems.\nThe Spanish forward tested Hart before laying on three good chances for fellow second-half substitute Leo Bonatini, who was unable to convert.\nVictory for Wolves means their impressive home record under Nuno continues; his side have only been beaten twice at Molineux in his 29 games in charge.\nBurnley's terrible start continues\nBurnley could perhaps have been forgiven for their poor start to the Premier League season given their Europa League exertions, but after the international break there could be few excuses for their uninspiring performance.\nTheir midfield was overrun by Wolves' energy, and Ashley Barnes' effort from range, which was easily saved, was his side's only shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.\nIt seemed to take conceding a goal for the team to kick into gear, and their best chance came shortly after going behind when Willy Boly almost deflected a Charlie Taylor shot inches wide, with Jack Cork unable to apply the finishing touch.\nBut it could have been worse for Burnley as Doherty fired wide with only the keeper to beat after being set up by Traore, and Bonatini missed several chances.\nGudmundsson, on his return from injury, could have stolen a point late on, but he shot straight at Rui Patricio and fired a free-kick over the bar.\n\"When there is a fog around the group it can eat into people,\" said Dyche. \"To bring that flow back you have to be strong mentally and physically.\n\"I think it's a mentality thing. Some of it can be worked at on the training ground, but I call it bottoming out; a collective moment when a group of players bottom out.\n\"The quicker that comes the better, because sometimes that opens the mind again and it all clicks back in again. You also have to work at that though.\"\nThe Clarets have now won only five of their past 26 Premier League matches.\nDyche, however, will have been encouraged by the performances of Hart and Tarkowski, the latter of whom showed why he has fought his way into the England fold.\nMan of the match - Joao Moutinho\n'We could have been more clinical' - what they said\nWolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I am very, very satisfied. We played good football and stayed organised and created chances. Burnley are a good side and stayed in it until the end.\n\"If there is a 'but', we could be more clinical. But if we can continue to make these many chances, it makes me very proud.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"When we got into the Europa League there was this immediate noise about it being tough. You are bombarded with it and it's hard to deal with that as a group - and then it becomes an easy story when you don't start the season well.\n\"People ramp it up and say 'there you are, I told you'. Well, we have to find a way through that and I remind them they are roughly the same group of players who finished seventh last season.\"\nBurnley's worst top-flight start in 91 years - the stats\nThis is Burnley's worst start to a season in the top-flight (one point from five games) since 1927-28, when they lost each of their opening five matches.\nWolves have won all three of their Premier League meetings with Burnley; against no other side have they recorded a 100% win ratio.\nBurnley have never won a Premier League away game against newly promoted opposition (W0 D6 L5).\nWolves have lost just one of their past 24 league games at Molineux (W16 D7 L1).\nWolves recorded more shots (30) against Burnley than they have against any other side in a single match in the Premier League.\nBurnley have now conceded 10 goals in their opening five league games this season; it took them 13 matches to concede their 10th goal of 2017-18.\nEach of Doherty's past four goal involvements in the league have come at Molineux (two goals, two assists).\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are back in action on Saturday, 22 September.

Ex-England captain Alan Shearer described that showing as \"embarrassing, hopeless and pathetic\".\nThis was a performance much closer to what fans will have been expecting since a summer spend of \u00a3100m and the arrival of ex-Real Madrid manager Pellegrini, title winner with Manchester City in 2014.\nThey were far better organised at the back, more confident in possession, and played with real energy against a full-blooded Everton side who were just determined to attack.\nLukas Fabianksi's goal withstood seven first-half attempts before Sigurdsson's unstoppable bullet header, and on the break Felipe Anderson was exceptional in his link-up play with Yarmolenko and Arnautovic, who was forced off in the second half.\nPellegrini said before this fixture he \"trusts now more than ever\" his ability to achieve at the highest level. His players backed him up with an impressive counter-attacking performance. Games against Chelsea and Manchester United are up next.\nEverton outplayed, outfinished\nIt would be hard on Everton to say they played badly on the whole - and nothing should be taken from the quality of West Ham's composed display - but there certainly were individual errors to pick out.\nThe Toffees were lucky to escape punishment on the break after Morgan Schneiderlin was caught in possession with his defence exposed, before Pickford hit a clearance straight to Noble for the second goal.\nSchneiderlin was withdrawn just before half-time in an attacking change, with summer signing Bernard replacing him. But Silva's match programme notes revealed the Frenchman's father had recently passed away and it appeared the Portuguese believed his performance was affected.\nSilva's side looked more switched on after the break, but here they came up against a team who were simply far sharper, especially in front of goal.\nIn the first half, Tosun headed straight at Fabianski when well placed to finish, shortly afterwards shooting meekly at the Polish keeper from inside the box.\nEverton had 16 attempts, but could only manage four shots on target. The Hammers also managed four shots on target but converted three. The suspended Richarlison, so impressive this season before his red card at Bournemouth, cut a frustrated figure in the stands.\nHowever, he will return for Everton's next fixture, and the fact Yerry Mina and Andre Gomes are yet to feature since joining from Barcelona should be further cause for optimism despite defeat.\nMan of the match - (Felipe Anderson)\nA birthday win for Pellegrini - the stats\nEverton have won just one of their past 13 Premier League games played on a Sunday, losing 10 and drawing two.\nWest Ham's Andriy Yarmolenko is the fourth Ukrainian player to score in the Premier League (also Sergei Rebrov, Andrei Shevchenko and Andriy Voronin) and the first since Voronin for Liverpool against Spurs in May 2008.\nSince the start of 2018, only Mohamed Salah (23) has had a hand in more Premier League goals than West Ham forward Marko Arnautovic (16 - nine goals, seven assists).\nArnautovic has been directly involved in 11 of West Ham's past 16 Premier League goals (seven goals, four assists).\nEverton midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson's goal was just the third header he has scored in his Premier League career (47th goal overall).\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini is the first manager to win on his birthday in the Premier League since Arsene Wenger on 22 October last season - also against Everton.\n'A tough result' - What the managers said\nEverton manager Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"We didn't play with enough quality to win the match.\n\"We started well with good pace and intensity, but we made mistakes, and at that moment we didn't react well.\n\"But even after the 1-0 we had a clear chance to score. We didn't perform well, but they had three chances and they scored three goals. We had four or five chances and we scored one goal.\n\"It's a tough result for us. A club like us to lose 3-1 at home is always tough. We have to react - there's nothing more to it. We have to react to the mistakes we made.\"\nOn Morgan Schneiderlin's early substitution: \"It was a tactical change, nothing more.\"\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"I was not worried about my birthday today - I just wanted to win the game - it was the best gift my players could give me.\n\"I think that we continued playing the same way we have done, but the best thing we did here, we went for the game from the first minute, we didn't wait for Everton to go.\n\"I have a lot of years here, I wasn't going to change for three or four results. We believe in what we are doing and we are not going to change. I said last time after we lost I will accept advice but I was not going to change what we are doing.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday in a 16:00 BST kick-off, while West Ham host Chelsea at 13:30 BST on the same day."

        "article_text": "Southampton 2-2 Brighton & Hove Albion: Late Murray penalty seals point for Brighton\nGlenn Murray struck a stoppage-time penalty as Brighton came from two goals down for the second consecutive game to earn a dramatic point at Southampton.\nMurray's fourth goal in five games came when referee Anthony Taylor ruled James Ward-Prowse had shoved Shane Duffy.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg's 35-yard strike had given Southampton a half-time lead, before Danny Ings' penalty made it 2-0.\nBut Duffy's free header from Anthony Knockaert's cross two minutes later set up the tense finish.\nThe action as it happened\nThe two sides began the game level on points in the Premier League table and the opening exchanges reflected that until the home side steadily grew in authority.\nIt was a Saints corner that produced the first real opportunity after 20 minutes, as both Hojbjerg and Ings saw attempts blocked before defender Wesley Hoedt fired over from close-range.\nChris Hughton's visitors struggled to create chances in the absence of the injured Pascal Gross, but emerged with greater purpose after the interval as Solly March forced Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy into action.\nIngs' penalty momentarily looked to have put Southampton firmly in control with 25 minutes remaining, but Duffy's lifeline allowed the Seagulls a route back into the match before substitute Alireza Jahanbakhsh hit the post.\nAnd Murray's leveller - his fifth goal in six starts against Southampton - secured Hughton's side a first away point of the season.\nIt also continued the Saints' miserable home record - they have won just once in the league at St Mary's since the end of November 2017.\nBrighton battle back again\nHughton's side showed character to rescue a point from two goals down against Fulham in their previous game on 1 September.\nAnd after a pedestrian start, the Seagulls were forced to demonstrate their resilience once again at St Mary's.\nBrighton rarely threatened in the first half and clearly missed the creative spark of Gross - a player who they have failed to win without since the start of last season.\nThe 34-year-old Murray, scorer of two against Fulham, was starved of opportunities until the visitors' resurgence after falling 2-0 behind, scoring their first away goals of the season.\nThey caught Southampton napping almost immediately after Ings penalty and used the nervousness of the home crowd to their advantage.\nTheir 3-2 victory over Manchester United remains their only win from five games in the Premier League, though the spirit shown in his players to return from the edge of defeat once again will offer a certain positive to manager Hughton.\nSaints left to rue dropped points\nMuch to the relief of manager Mark Hughes, Southampton corrected their slow Premier League start with a first victory, at Crystal Palace before the international break.\nThe break came at the worst time for Hughes' side in that sense, though the task of using that positive performance to gain momentum remained for the Saints.\nHughes was seeking his first back-to-back league wins since January 2017 - when manager of Stoke City - and Hojbjerg's emphatic opener served as a deserved marker of Saints' first-half dominance.\nIngs' sharp movement in the area saw him bundled over by Gaetan Bong, allowing the Liverpool loanee to create breathing space for the home side after Brighton had begun to gain a foothold in the contest.\nYet, despite appearing to be in control, Saints were unable to see out the game - a trait that will frustrate manager Hughes.\nAfter throwing away a two-goal advantage, the Saints have now dropped 26 points from leading positions in the Premier League since the start of last season.\nThere were plenty of positives for Hughes' side, as Hojbjerg and Mario Lemina controlled the midfield and summer signing Jannick Vestergaard appears an increasingly astute addition at the back - but to finish with just one point will leave a rather sour taste.\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Southampton)\n'It feels like a win' - what they said\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"If you are away from home, particularly against Southampton who are a good side, to be 2-0 down and come back like we did, it feels like a win.\n\"It was down to a bit of everything. We knew how they would play and we needed to play with more intensity. We got the reaction we wanted in the second half.\n\"Credit to the players. They wanted to get back in this game and they showed great attitude. We have character, we have quality but we also have a bit of naivety. We made a few mistakes.\"\nSouthampton boss Mark Hughes: \"We went into the game wanting to win - we wanted back-to-back results. It wasn't to be. We got into a winning position and maybe didn't have the nous to make sure we kept the margin at 2-0.\n\"Brighton had nothing to lose and threw people forward and got balls into our area and it's about the percentages. You just hope you can defend those percentages.\n\"We're disappointed with the award of the penalty. Shane Duffy is a big lad and he's gone down easily under an innocuous challenge. They will look for anything they can get and the referee has bought that.\"\nMonday misery for Saints - the stats\nSouthampton are winless in their past 11 Premier League games played on a Monday, losing seven of those.\nThey have dropped 26 points from leading positions in the Premier League since the start of last season, the most of any side to appear in both campaigns.\nBrighton have managed just two away wins in the Premier League since the start of last season, fewer than any other side to appear in both the 2017-18 and 2018-19 campaigns.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg has scored two goals in his past two Premier League games for Southampton, as many as he managed in his previous 102 appearances in Europe's big five leagues.\nHojbjerg's strike for Southampton came from 34.9 yards out, the longest-range strike in the Premier League this season.\nSouthampton striker Danny Ings has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since February 2015.\nBrighton winger Anthony Knockaert has registered three assists in his past four Premier League games, after managing just one in his previous 43 games in the competition.\nWhat next?\nSouthampton travel to Anfield to face Liverpool on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Brighton host Tottenham later that day (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-1 Watford: Hosts strike back after disastrous early concession\nWatford had to settle for a draw at Fulham after Aleksandar Mitrovic struck late on to earn the hosts a point.\nThe Hornets punished a poor start by Fulham as Andre Gray sidefooted home inside 90 seconds and the visitors, who won their first four Premier League games of the season, dominated the first half.\nGray was denied by Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli either side of the break and Watford paid for their wasted chances as an improved second-half performance by the hosts saw them draw level through Mitrovic's equaliser on 78 minutes.\nThe Serb twice went close to claiming a late winner for the Cottagers, including a header against the crossbar, although that would have been hard on Watford, who had looked well on course to return to winning ways after losing to Manchester United last Saturday.\nDespite Fulham missing out on only their second league win since returning to the top flight, their coach Slavisa Jokanovic will be encouraged by the way his side tightened up after the break.\nFulham defence in disarray\nJokanovic, who left Watford shortly after leading them into the Premier League in 2015, has named a different back four for each game this season and it showed as their defence was again in disarray in the first half.\nThe Cottagers have the worst defensive record in the league and for the second week running they conceded inside two minutes, wasting four chances to clear following a tame throw-in.\nWatford defender Christian Kabasele also enjoyed a free run at Jose Holebas' corner, with his header blocked by Ryan Sessegnon, before Alfie Mawson endured a miserable first half.\nThe summer signing from Swansea misjudged two headers, gifting chances to Gray and Roberto Pereyra, before being booked and surviving a penalty appeal for a clumsy sliding challenge on Will Hughes. Jokanovic put Mawson out of his misery by making a double substitution at half-time.\nFulham's only chance of the first half saw Luciano Vietto test Ben Foster on the counter-attack before curling the rebound wide.\nTop scorer Mitrovic then came to the fore, heading over from an Andre Schurrle cross before tapping in from Vietto's square ball to claim his fifth goal of the season.\nHad his late shot beaten Foster, or his header from the resulting corner dropped a few inches lower, it would have given Fulham a victory they did not deserve.\nConsistency key for Watford\nDespite seeing their surprise 100% start ended by Manchester United, Watford coach Javi Gracia named an unchanged team, and in doing so the Hornets became just the fifth team to name the same starting XI for their first six games of a Premier League season (after Leeds 1992-93, Tottenham 1994-95, Liverpool 1996-97 and Aston Villa 2008-09).\nThe visiting fans were hoping to see their side bounce back from defeat by Manchester United and show that their positive start was not just a matter of catching their early-season opponents flat-footed - and Watford were soon in their stride.\nAfter some poor defending by Fulham, Hughes pounced on the loose ball on the edge of the box and played in Gray to slot into the bottom corner for his third goal of the season.\nOrganised at the back and comfortable on the ball in midfield, they also had the outlet of in-form strike pair Gray and Troy Deeney, who held the ball up for their supporting team-mates as well as proving a constant menace to Fulham centre-halves Mawson and Calum Chambers.\nAnother Gray effort looped behind off Bettinelli after the striker latched on to Mawson's poor header, and Pereyra curled a shot wide before Gray's second-half shot was saved by Bettinelli.\nEven after the equaliser, Watford substitute Isaac Success was denied by Bettinelli, and when Mitrovic twice went close at the death, it was the only time the Hornets defence was struggling.\nOverall, they were a well-drilled unit and if Gracia has the luxury of keeping a settled side, they should be confident of improving on last season's 14th-place finish.\nMan of the match - Will Hughes (Watford)\n'We couldn't control Deeney' - what they said\nFulham coach Slavisa Jokanovic: \"I believe we deserved a point. We started the game sloppily and conceded a goal easily. We were a little confused and didn't find our game. Troy Deeney caused us many damages and we didn't find a way to control him.\n\"They could have scored more but in the second 45 minutes we moved some players. The team showed a different approach and started to move the ball better. I believe the result is fair and we must keep going forward.\n\"Mitrovic played well. It wouldn't be easy against the Watford centre-backs but he found the chance to score the goal. He must keep going and he is an important player for us.\"\nWatford coach Javi Gracia: \"After we scored in the first minutes and after a good first half, all of us thought we would be able to get three points. At the end of the game they scored.\n\"We played much better in the first half when we had to kill the game and score another goal. We had the chances to do it. In the second they changed their shape and we tried to keep the high press and we suffered a bit.\n\"We tried to keep the same level of intensity and ambition. The players feel really bad. They are hungry, they want to win and have made a very big effort today. They played really well in the first half. That is what we want to keep for the rest of the season.\"\nMitrovic on fire - the stats\nThis was Fulham's 500th match in the Premier League, making them the 15th team to reach the milestone.\nWatford are without a win on their past nine Premier League visits to London, their draw against Fulham coming after eight consecutive defeats.\nGray's goal, timed at one minute 27 seconds, was the quickest in the Premier League since 10 March 2018 (Kenedy for Newcastle v Southampton, 1:03).\nGray's goal (1:27) was also Watford's second quickest in the Premier League after Etienne Capoue against Leicester in November 2016 (32 seconds).\nSince his debut for Fulham in February 2018, Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored 17 goals in English league football, more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nFulham make the short trip to Millwall in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (19:45 BST) before returning to Premier League action at Everton next Saturday (15:00).\nWatford have another two London derbies over the next week, at Tottenham in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (20:00) - with the game to be played at Milton Keynes - and at Arsenal in the league on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 Wolves: Joao Moutinho earns visitors draw at Old Trafford\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho says he expects more from his attacking players after they were held to a draw at Old Trafford by an impressive Wolves side.\nJoao Moutinho's superb strike saw the newly promoted visitors continue their strong start to life in the Premier League.\nThe Portuguese whipped in from the edge of the area as Nuno Espirito Santo's team matched their hosts.\nWolves were lively in the first half and unlucky to go behind as Fred netted his first goal for United - the Brazilian firing in from just inside the box after Paul Pogba's excellent touch.\nAnd Mourinho said the visitors \"were more aggressive, had more intent and were more motivated\".\n\"I think the result is fair. They deserved their point and we deserve the punishment of only getting one point,\" the United boss told BBC Sport.\n\"The way we started we were lucky to be the first team to score. Their approach was more for a football match than ours.\"\nUnited, with former manager Sir Alex Ferguson watching on during his first visit to Old Trafford since having emergency brain surgery in May, were looking for a third straight league win.\nThe hosts were on top after the break, but Raul Jimenez's clever lay-off set up Moutinho for what was a deserved equaliser for the visitors.\nThe draw keeps Wolves one point behind Manchester United in 10th, as Mourinho's side climb to fifth.\nRelive the action at Old Trafford\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nA familiar Portuguese affair\nThe last time Wolves visited Manchester United in the Premier League, they fell to a 4-1 thrashing on their way to finishing bottom of the table. It was the same season Mourinho guided Real Madrid to a first La Liga title in four seasons.\nMuch has changed for both parties in the seven years since - Wolves dropping into League One before starting their ascent to the top flight and Mourinho making a title-winning return to former club Chelsea. But there was a sense of familiarity at Old Trafford as the well-acquainted Portuguese coaches took to either dugout.\nWolves boss Santo, Mourinho's back-up goalkeeper for Porto from 2002 to 2004, regards his former manager as \"a big inspiration\" in his career, but he more than matched his mentor tactically as Wolves' brand of quick, counter-attacking football caused the hosts problems.\nWolves were unlucky to head into half-time behind, with United goalkeeper David de Gea saving well from Willy Boly's header having earlier parried a smart turn and shot from Jimenez.\nThe Championship winners have benefited from an influx of Portuguese stars under the influence of agent Jorge Mendes, who acts as an advisor to Wolves' owners Fosun and also represents Mourinho.\nAnd it was summer arrival Moutinho, with 113 Portugal caps to his name, who inspired the visitors' fight back alongside his younger compatriot Ruben Neves in midfield.\nMoutinho's leveller was well deserved as Wolves became the first team this season to take points off both Manchester sides.\nFred on target as United's attacking stars struggle\nMourinho made a point of saying Alexis Sanchez, rested for the Champions League trip to Young Boys on Wednesday, would start in place of Anthony Martial on Saturday, with Marcus Rashford suspended.\nThe Chile forward was consistently Arsenal's best player before moving to Old Trafford in January, scoring almost a goal every other game in three and a half years with the Gunners. But he has struggled to replicate that form and is yet to find the net this season.\nIt was Sanchez's cross that was headed away in the build-up to the opening goal, but the 29-year-old was replaced just after the hour mark after being well marshalled by the Wolves defence, while striker Romelu Lukaku failed to have a shot on target.\n\"I was expecting more from my attacking players. There was not enough creativity, movement or dynamism,\" said Mourinho afterwards.\nUnited's attacking threat instead came from left-back Luke Shaw, midfielders Pogba and Fred and increasingly Marouane Fellaini, who saw a header saved by Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\nFred, a summer signing from Shakhtar Donetsk, took his goal well from Pogba's brilliant assist and also forced Patricio into a diving save from a free-kick.\nThe hosts increased the pressure late on and were improved by the arrival of Martial and Juan Mata, but looked vulnerable on the break and had De Gea to thank for keeping out an effort from Wolves substitute Adama Traore.\nMan of the match - Raul Jimenez (Wolves)\n'We deserve the punishment of one point'\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport: \"They started better and were more aggressive, had more intent and I don't know why but they were more motivated.\n\"We made it quite easy for them to cope with our supremacy in last 20 minutes. Overall we don't deserve more than this.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was a good game, two teams wanting to win, lots of chances and emotion. I thought it was a point deserved.\n\"We draw and we are happy, but know that we have to improve if we want to come to Old Trafford and win one day. We wanted to come here and score because we cannot play any other way.\n\"We are growing game by game and getting a little better.\"\nFormer Liverpool and Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"The front three [of Watford] are a real threat. They will score more goals with a bit more care in the final third. They caused Manchester United all kinds of problems.\n\"Wolves are as accomplished a side I've ever seen from the Championship. They tired a bit towards the end but they deserved their point and probably a little bit more on the day. I was really impressed. I think they can finish in the top half. Teams are going to Old Trafford now without that fear factor. There are really positive signs for Wolves. Manchester United have had a difficult start but I can't see them competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, I really can't.\"\nFred becomes United's 500th scorer - the stats\nManchester United have dropped six points from seven Premier League games at Old Trafford against newly promoted opposition under Jose Mourinho, more than in the 10 seasons beforehand [five].\nWolves avoided defeat at Old Trafford for the first time since November 1980, stopping a run of eight successive losses in all competitions.\nJoao Moutinho's goal was his first in 28 league games since netting against Paris St-Germain for Monaco in November 2017.\nFred is the first Brazilian player to score a Premier League goal for Manchester United since Rafael against QPR in February 2013.\nHe is also the 500th different player to score a competitive goal for United [not including own goals].\nPaul Pogba has been directly involved in six goals in his seven starts in all competitions for Mourinho's side this season [four goals, two assists].\nWhat's next?\nManchester United welcome Frank Lampard's Derby to Old Trafford in the EFL Cup third round on Tuesday (kick-off 20:00 BST), before travelling to West Ham in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off.\nWolves host Leicester in the EFL Cup on Tuesday (19:45), before Southampton visit Molineux next Saturday."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-0 Southampton: Reds ease past Saints for seventh straight win\nLiverpool won a seventh straight game in all competitions from the start of a season for the first time in 28 years by easing past Southampton at Anfield.\nThe hosts scored three first-half goals to subdue Saints into just limiting the damage after the break and Reds boss Jurgen Klopp said the challenges will get \"tougher and tougher\" for his side.\n\"I wasn't interested in the history before the game but now I like it,\" the German told BBC Sport.\n\"We will try to carry on that path but it's unbelievable what is coming up now.\"\nIn their next four matches, Liverpool face Chelsea twice, travel to Napoli and then host Premier League champions Manchester City.\n\"The boys are in good shape. That helps - let's see if we can carry on,\" added Klopp.\nOn Saturday, the hosts took the lead after 10 minutes when Xherdan Shaqiri's shot deflected off Shane Long and then Wesley Hoedt for a peculiar own goal.\nJoel Matip rose above opposing centre-back Jannik Vestergaard to head in Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner and double the advantage.\nLiverpool added a third just before the break as Shaqiri's superb free-kick came down off the crossbar and Mohamed Salah turned the ball in from close range.\nSaints were not quite as poor as being three down at half-time suggests. However, they sat back in the second half, perhaps content not to be embarrassed - though Salah did have a goal disallowed for offside late on.\nKlopp's side go back to the top of the Premier League with their sixth straight win in the competition, and they also beat Paris St-Germain in their Champions League opener on Tuesday.\nLiverpool won eight straight league games and 10 in all competitions from the start the 1990-91 season.\nLiverpool 3-0 Southampton - as it happened\nAll of Saturday's Premier League action\nThree and easy\nThe second half of this game felt like an extra training session for both sides given how emphatically Liverpool's first-half spree had ended the match as a contest.\nTheir opener was fortuitous but did originate from Sadio Mane's superb pass to pick out Shaqiri on the left before the Swiss - who was making his first Liverpool start - cut back onto his right and tried to pick out the far corner.\nLong blocked the strike but Hoedt could not prevent the deflection rebounding off his thigh and past the scrambling Alex McCarthy.\nMane, Salah and Roberto Firmino - making his full return after an eye injury - scythed through Southampton at times but could not quite find the decisive final touch, with Salah denied by a fine Cedric Soares tackle after a one-two with Firmino.\nBut if the Reds' poise was slightly off, the power was not - Matip thumping a header into the top of the net from the corner that followed Cedric's intervention.\nShaqiri was then denied by the crossbar after beating McCarthy from 25 yards with a sublime, dipping free-kick, but Salah was sharp enough to get to the rebound first and score his third of the season.\nSterner tests await\nAside from the 4-0 thrashing of West Ham on the opening weekend, this was perhaps the easiest win of Liverpool's record run and Saints' complete indifference to chasing the game in the second half afforded the hosts welcome comfort after the frenetic 3-2 win over PSG.\nThe only real moment of concern was when Virgil van Dijk, solid in defence whenever his former side did foray forward, had to come off after being struck in the torso, though Klopp said after the game the injury is not serious.\n\"Before the PSG game, he already had kind of a bruised rib, which is very uncomfortable, and he got another hit there,\" said the German.\nLiverpool next face Chelsea back to back in the Carabao Cup and Premier League, before travelling to Napoli in the Champions League and then hosting champions Manchester City in the league on 7 October.\nThose opponents, not an insipid Southampton, will give a better indication of how strong this Reds side are.\nSpiritless Saints\nSouthampton were unlikely ever to try and steamroller Liverpool but they were limited by Danny Ings being unable to play against his parent club and fellow forward Manolo Gabbiadini ruled out with a hamstring problem.\nInstead it was left to Long, who has now scored just twice in his past 52 appearances, to lead the line and the Republic of Ireland striker was isolated for long periods.\nThey did create openings - Nathan Redmond got in behind down the right several times, while Ryan Bertrand picked out Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg unmarked in the area, only for the Denmark midfielder to scuff his effort.\nYet it took until the 91st minute for Saints to have a shot on target when substitute Charlie Austin struck straight at Alisson.\nUltimately, that unlucky own goal and Vestergaard's mistake in allowing Matip to get above him for the second killed any interest Mark Hughes' side had in challenging a clearly superior side.\nThey sat deeper and deeper as the second half wore on, more reminiscent of a side protecting a 1-0 lead than trying not to concede a fourth - and they almost failed in that endeavour too, but Salah came back from an offside position to turn in James Milner's blocked shot.\nMan of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri (Liverpool)\n'Not a good day for us' - reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp talking to BBC Sport: \"My plan was to change tactics but we didn't have time to train because of the weather in Liverpool.\n\"In the second half we had to control the game and it wasn't the most exciting football anymore but we were still good enough to be the deserved winner.\"\nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes, talking to BBC Sport: \"We conceded too readily in the first half. Clearly you don't want to do that against a very good Liverpool team at home.\n\"We were guilty of not stopping them creating moments in the first half. The second half was damage limitation.

        "article_text": "Cardiff City 0-5 Manchester City: Visitors atone for Champions League defeat\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola described Riyad Mahrez as an \"incredibly talented\" player after he scored his first goals for the club to help them thrash Cardiff City.\nMahrez, who signed for \u00a360m in the summer, tapped in his first goal - and Manchester City's fourth - after a patient, incisive team move, before whipping in his second late on.\n\"It's good to get the first goals,\" Guardiola said. \"Of course it's important for him. He came here, he's an incredibly talented player. He deserves to play more minutes, like Phil Foden.\"\nThe 18-year-old Englishman played for around 25 minutes as a substitute. \"It's a pleasure to watch Phil play football and of course Riyad as well,\" Guardiola continued. \"But the season is too long and they have to be ready, prepared, because they are going to play a lot of minutes.\"\nThe stylish visitors were already out of sight by half-time, leading 3-0 thanks to Sergio Aguero's sweeping finish, a clever looping header from Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan's delightful curling effort.\nCardiff simply could not live with an irresistible City side and, as they are still searching for their first win this season, the Bluebirds now find themselves second from bottom of the table.\nRelive Manchester City's win against Cardiff City\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nCardiff's Peltier suffers long-term injury\nSuperb City bounce back\nFor Manchester City, this was an instant and convincing riposte following Wednesday's shock defeat at home to Lyon in the Champions League.\nThat loss was made to look like an aberration by this performance, even if it was against a newly promoted Cardiff side who look ill equipped to cope with the Premier League's leading teams.\nCity asserted their dominance from the first minute and, once Aguero had opened the scoring in his 300th appearance for the club after half an hour, this match became a procession.\nGuardiola's players passed and moved with grace and speed, leaving their opponents bewildered.\nCardiff, a physically imposing side, will have been disappointed to allow one of the shortest players on the pitch, Bernardo Silva, to score the second with his head - but it was still a goal to marvel at, as the Portuguese arced his neck to generate the dip required to loop the ball backwards over goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.\nThere was even more to admire in the third goal, as Gundogan neatly exchanged passes with Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling before stroking the ball into the top corner.\nGundogan then turned provider for the fourth - and arguably the best - goal of the afternoon, with a sustained period of City possession freeing the Germany midfielder to square the ball for Mahrez to convert from close range.\nThe win has moved Manchester City up to second in the Premier League table.\nCardiff outclassed again\nTempers had flared when these two sides met here in the FA Cup in January, when Cardiff's Joe Bennett was sent off.\nCity thoroughly outclassed their opponents - then in the Championship - to win 2-0 on that occasion, and the gulf in quality appeared even greater this time.\nCardiff initially battled as enthusiastically as one would expect from a team managed by Neil Warnock. But as soon as they conceded the opening goal, a thrashing seemed inevitable.\nWhile the Bluebirds may not have expected much from a fixture against the reigning champions, it will concern Warnock that his side have now conceded 12 goals in their past three games.\nAfter matches against City, Chelsea and Arsenal, Cardiff will be relieved to welcome Burnley to south Wales next weekend.\nMan of the match - Ilkay Gundogan (Manchester City)\nA 'long afternoon' - what they said\nCardiff City manager Neil Warnock: \"It was a long afternoon. I thought we started well. The first 30 minutes, we had shape and knew what we were doing but the goals killed us. I've not seen our heads go down like that.\n\"The first goal came from a corner which shouldn't happen, but the top teams - that's what they do. They find a weakness and one lapse and Aguero is in. The second goal I thought was a fluke. It came almost straight away and knocked the stuffing out of us really.\n\"It's a disappointment. Like I said before, it's not going to define our season but it will knock our chin on the floor a bit. The lads have got to get over the weekend and get on with next week.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola [On his return from a touchline ban]: \"I don't play. The managers, we are there to be there when they have little doubts, to support them.\n\"I don't know what's going to happen with that guys. It's the same group, they keep reacting, an exceptional group. They know how, when the situation is not good in terms of results, the closer I am to them.\n\"They deserve all my respect. They made me happy the last, more than one year, two seasons, and that's why - always I will be with them.\"\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas on Match of the Day: \"After the disappointment in mid-week it was important for City to get back to winning ways. It was that kind of afternoon for players like Raheem Sterling and Ilkay Gundogan and they seemed to enjoy themselves.\n\"Gundogan was special. He filled the void of not having David Silva in the side perfectly. He was willing to make things happen. Cardiff gave him too much space. It was his all round game - his deliveries into the box. It was a brilliant performance. He was the stand-out but Sterling was great and Riyad Mahrez got a couple of goals too.\"\nCity show their dominance - the stats\nCardiff lost a home league game by a five-goal margin for the first time since April 1994 (2-7 v Cambridge in the third tier).\nSince Pep Guardiola took over before the 2016-17 season, Manchester City have scored 5+ goals in 10 Premier League fixtures.\nSergio Aguero made his 300th appearance for Manchester City in all competitions, and scored his 205th goal for the club.\nManchester City striker Aguero has now scored 13 and assisted two more in his last 13 Premier League games against newly promoted sides.\nBernardo Silva scored and assisted in the same game for the first time ever for Manchester City in his 61 appearances for the club in all competitions.\nSilva's goal for Manchester City was his first headed goal for the club in any competition.\nSince the start of last season, Raheem Sterling has registered 12 Premier League assists, more than any other English player, and a tally only Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sane can better overall (16 each).\nRiyad Mahrez scored his first goals for Manchester City and his first double in the Premier League since netting twice for Leicester against Everton in December 2015.\nWhat's next?\nCardiff City's next fixture sees them take on Burnley in the Premier League at home on Sunday, 30 September (16:00 BST).\nMeanwhile, Manchester City travel to Oxford United in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, 25 September (19:45), before welcoming Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday, 29 September (15:00)."

It's a start,\" said Dyche.\nBurnley's win, their first in 10 league games, moved them up to 16th in the table while Bournemouth dropped to seventh place.\n\"I was pleased with our energy and control of the game early on. We were making chances, forcing them back and being creative in different ways - they were four good goals for different reasons,\" added the Clarets manager..\nBournemouth had enjoyed the better of an even first half before Burnley's goals, hitting the bar when Nathan Ake's shot deflected over Burnley goalkeeper Joe Hart and onto the woodwork.\nRelive the action\nCatch up an all Saturday's Premier League news\nHart made a good save with his feet to deny David Brooks in the second half, but Bournemouth, for all their pressure, could not make their dominance count and were punished by Barnes' late strikes.\nDyche can see clearly now\nDyche had spoken of \"lifting the fog\" in the wake of last Sunday's defeat at Wolves that meant Burnley had made their worst start to a top-flight season since 1927.\nThis determined display, following a dispiriting start to the season, should have started to do that with the Lancashire side reclaiming the hard-to-beat quality that helped them finish seventh last season.\nThey lived dangerously at times, with Ake striking the crossbar, Hart saving to thwart Brooks and Callum Wilson just short of reaching a cross while the score was still 0-0.\nBut Dyche will be delighted that his team, who had scored only three league goals before this game, took their chances when they came.\nVydra marked his first Premier League start for Burnley since arriving from Derby with a clinical finish while Lennon timed his run at the far post to perfection to score his first league goal since March 2016.\nBurnley absorbed multiple attacks from their visitors after the break, and Hart's save, made with England manager Gareth Southgate watching from the stands at Turf Moor, proved to be crucial before Barnes applied the finishing touches.\nCherries fail to make possession count\nBournemouth's start to the season had been in sharp contrast to Burnley's, with Eddie Howe's side rising to fifth thanks to a strong defensive mindset added to the attacking flair for which they are known.\nBut the Cherries boss will have left the ground where he was in charge from January 2011 to October 2012 wondering how they departed empty-handed.\nBournemouth had 63% of the possession overall, but failing to convert that into goals - and a spell of two minutes where they allowed their hosts to put daylight between the two sides before the break - was crucial.\nFor all the time on the ball in the second half, Howe's side needed more threat inside the Burnley area and the introduction of Jermain Defoe with 12 minutes left finally gave the south coast club an edge.\nBut they left themselves open to counterattacks and suffered the consequences late on for not taking advantage when they had the chance.\nMan of the match - Aaron Lennon (Burnley)\n'They left themselves open'- what the managers said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We had to defend diligently. Then they left themselves open and we capitalised on that.\n\"We made some massive chances against Southampton and Watford and didn't take them - today we did.\n\"I don't think Bournemouth were knocking on the door too much. It was an important save by Joe Hart but it would have been unjust for them to get something because I thought we were very good overall.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I don't think it was a 4-0 performance. We were well in the game and had chances, but we didn't take them.\n\"We had them penned in at 2-0 and we were one goal from changing the entire mood of the game but we never got that goal and conceded two on the break.\n\"We're very disappointed to concede four. That didn't look on the cards early in game. We knew coming here that we'd have to defend crosses and set-plays well and we didn't do that.\n\"We also had the ball in good areas and different decisions could have led to a different outcome. We know how unforgiving the league is, and if you come off your high standards then you get beaten so we need to address that.\"\nBBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"Johann Berg Gudmundsson was just about the star of the show but Aaron Lennon did really, really well.\n\"He has a sweet left foot but Aaron Lennon was getting in at the back post. I love a winger who can go either way. His all-round game was terrific. The Bournemouth full-backs couldn't cope with either of them.\n\"It was like the Burnley we saw last season. I think they will be absolutely fine. They have two big games coming up which could get them back on track.\"\nQuickfire Clarets - the stats you need to know\nThere were only 125 seconds between Burnley's first and second goals.\nBurnley scored four goals against Bournemouth, as many as in their previous eight Premier League games combined.\nBournemouth have kept only one clean sheet in their last 15 away Premier League games, shipping 30 goals in those fixtures.\nMatej Vydra is the fifth player to score on his first Premier League start for Burnley, after Daniel Fox, Scott Arfield, Robbie Brady and Chris Wood.\nAaron Lennon scored his first Premier League goal in 55 appearances, since netting for Everton against West Ham on March 5th 2016.\nJohann Berg Gudmundsson has registered 12 Premier League assists for Burnley, seven more than any other player.\nAshley Barnes scored two goals in a Premier League game for the first time, on his 105th appearance.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Burton Albion in the EFL Cup at 19:45 BST on Tuesday, and are away again the Premier League next weekend, heading to Cardiff City on Sunday 30 September at 16:00.\nBournemouth host another east Lancashire side, Blackburn Rovers in the EFL Cup on Tuesday at 19:45, and then welcome Crystal Palace to Dorset on Monday, 1 Octpber at 20:00."

I would like to prevent this start and we have to correct this situation. It is always difficult to find space and come back into games but I am happy about our desire and our mentality.\n\"It is a fantastic feeling to overcome this opponent who plays deep and defends well and it was important to come back in the second half with more desire and put them under pressure. We have quality on the pitch but our beginning is not enough.\"\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner said: \"We made so many big mistakes in my point of view. We got the lead but we gave them presents. We conceded two counter-attack goals against Leicester, and we didn't use our chances in the offensive side.\n\"Apart from that, the performance and the attitude was there. If I compare the gap between us and the other teams, there is not a lot and I can see we are closing the gap in terms of performances and the talent we have, but the opponent didn't have to invest anything to score today and that is what we have to stop.\"\nJorgensen's first club goal not enough for Huddersfield - the stats\nLeicester have won nine of their past 10 league games against Huddersfield (D1), netting 28 goals in the process.\nLeicester have won their past eight home league meetings versus Huddersfield - the Foxes' longest current winning streak of that kind against any side in the league.\nHuddersfield have scored in five of their past six Premier League away games, finding the net in more away trips than in their first 16 in the competition (four games scored in).\nLeicester's Jamie Vardy has scored in his past three league appearances against Huddersfield, also providing an assist for Kelechi Iheanacho's goal.\nJames Maddison has either scored or assisted in four of his past five Premier League starts for Leicester City (three goals, one assist).\nHuddersfield defender Mathias Jorgensen scored his first goal for the club in all competitions in his 45th appearance for the club.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Wolves in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday at 19:45 BST while Huddersfield host Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday, 29 September at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-0 Newcastle United: Visitors hold on for second point of season\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson believes the fallout from recent comments by Wilfried Zaha might have affected his performance in the goalless draw with Newcastle.\nThe 25-year-old winger suggested that any rough treatment he receives on the pitch is not dealt with adequately by officials and that his leg would have to be broken for an opponent to receive a red card.\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez\n, external\nsaid he was surprised the Football Association did not act on the Ivory Coast player's suggestions.\nZaha, who was influential in helping the Eagles avoid relegation last season and has scored three of their four league goals in this campaign, only managed two efforts on goal against the Magpies.\nHodgson told BBC's Match of the Day: \"Wilf was quiet, but I fear that was of his own making to some extent.\n\"It's not been a good week for him with the discussion and polemic over the interview. I thought that was the quietest I've seen him in a long time. That was disappointing. Wilf in high form just might have been the difference.\"\nPalace had the best chances at Selhurst Park with skipper Luka Milivojevic's first-half free-kick hitting the post, while Mamadou Sakho somehow failed to find the target from a header at the far post with the goal open.\nNewcastle, who hung on in the closing minutes, created little. Spanish attacker Ayoze Perez had their best chance when he fired a shot at keeper Wayne Hennessey following a defensive mistake by James Tomkins in the opening half.\nThe draw means Newcastle move up one place to 18th with two points from six games and the Eagles remain in 11th with seven points.\nRead: Is the Crystal Palace winger a target?\nPalace player hit by bottle\nThere was also an unsavoury incident during the second half when Palace defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka was struck on the side of the face by a plastic bottle thrown from the crowd.\nThe culprit has yet to be identified, but Magpies boss Benitez said: \"It is not good.

The defender also had the first clear chance of the game when he headed over from four yards.\nMilivojevic is one of the best set-piece players in the Premier League at the moment, although on Saturday his deliveries were well read by Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka, bar the one which beat the Slovakian and came off the far post.\nAnd then came Sakho's miss. It was not clear whether the ball had gone out before Andros Townsend produced a peach of a delivery for the former Liverpool player who headed wide from a couple of yards out.\nThe French defender sunk to the ground clutching his face in embarrassment as the home support shared his disbelief.\nNewcastle create little but remain disciplined\nAs for Newcastle, they were watched by owner Mike Ashley for the first time since May 2017.\nOne point from five games coming into this fixture meant that their ire was once more directed at the man who they believe did not provide enough transfer funds in the summer.\nOne player brought in, on-loan striker Salomon Rondon, was ineffective again and replaced by Joselu at half-time. The Spaniard has improved markedly in his second season at the club, and produced a brilliant overhead kick which flew straight into the arms of keeper Wayne Hennessey.\nAside from that effort, Perez should have done better with a first-half strike after an error by Tomkins, while Jamaal Lascelles twice missed the target after getting into good positions from corners.

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said Spurs \"needed to feel victory again\" after beating Brighton to end a run of three straight defeats.\nHarry Kane broke the deadlock in a first half of few chances, drilling in a penalty after a Glenn Murray handball. Substitute Erik Lamela scored their second to ensure there would be no repeat of their Champions League collapse at Inter Milan in midweek.\nAnthony Knockaert pulled one back in stoppage time but Brighton were unable to salvage a third straight Premier League draw.\n\"The victory was so important for us,\" said Pochettino. \"We know it's tough to play here. Brighton are a very aggressive team on set-pieces and they're a team that works so hard.\n\"But we worked hard too and played well in different periods of the game.\n\"We were so aggressive and then with the ball we played some good football so I am happy with the three points, but more pleased with the performance and the reaction.\"\nLow-risk strategy pays off for Spurs\nGiven the heavy rain and their recent form, it was hardly surprising to see Spurs gain early control of the game and play with a low-risk strategy.\nAt half-time they had enjoyed 78.6% possession with a passing accuracy of 92.4% - although few of those passes were telling balls into the final third.\nWhile that led to a half as drab as the weather, Spurs were comfortable before the break without looking like they would carve open the hosts' defence.\nKane's penalty was one of only two shots on target in the first half. The other was from a Kieran Trippier corner, when Toby Alderweireld's near-post header was deflected and keeper Mat Ryan saved acrobatically to his left.\nThe game opened up after the interval, with Brighton enjoying a brief spell of pressure, but Spurs continued to monopolise possession.\nLamela spread the play to the recalled Lucas Moura, who found Rose down the left before Lamela got on the end of a low cross to ease any Tottenham nerves.\nSpurs have shown they can play more expansively than this, but after league defeats by Watford and Liverpool, Pochettino will be happy to leave that for another day.\nMisery for Murray and Brighton\nAlthough Brighton have tended to take the game to the opposition this season, they were starved of possession early on and lost Dale Stephens, arguably their most accomplished ball player, to injury on 21 minutes.\nWhile the pace of Knockaert out wide provided some encouragement, his delivery was wayward and Murray's error handed Spurs the chance to go in front.\nBoos rang around the Amex Stadium at half-time but Brighton can have few complaints about the penalty decision.\nMurray's arm was raised and was not protecting his face, but was stretched to his right. It was also unnecessary because Davy Propper, the man next to Murray in the wall, was bracing himself to block Trippier's shot with his head.\nWith Hugo Lloris and Michel Vorm both injured for Spurs, Albion ought to have tested the inexperienced third-choice goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga more.\nBrighton won their second corner on 63 minutes, which was cleared as far as Solly March, whose shot deflected just over the crossbar, while Shane Duffy had a goal disallowed for offside.\nBut Brighton's best chance of an equaliser came and went as Beram Kayal found Knockaert, who cut inside the returning Alderweireld only to hit a tame effort too close to Gazzaniga.\nAnd although Knockaert did score from a late break after being released by Duffy's long ball, he and his Brighton team-mates will have to produce better finishing than his even later effort - again easy for Gazzaniga - if the Seagulls are to take points off the Champions League teams on a regular basis.\n'The free-kick was soft' - what they said\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton said: \"We were up against a very good team, a very expansive team, and with the formation we play sometimes it's difficult to press them in the areas you would like.\n\"They can move the ball very well and what's important is that you stay in the game. Without the penalty, if we went in at half-time at 0-0, I think it gives us a real good opportunity to get something from the game, if we were able to press higher.\n\"I think it was a penalty but I think it was a soft award of the free-kick.

        "article_text": "West Ham 0-0 Chelsea: Maurizio Sarri's side drop points in London derby\nChelsea's 100% start to the Premier League season came to an end at West Ham because Eden Hazard was not allowed to influence the game, says Hammers manager Manuel Pellegrini.\nBlues boss Maurizio Sarri started his Stamford Bridge reign with five straight league wins but his team could not extend that record and had to settle for a goalless draw against battling opponents on Sunday.\nPellegrini - whose side had lost their previous two home league matches - was pleased with how West Ham \"allowed Chelsea to have possession\" on the right side of the pitch, denying the \"dangerous\" Marcos Alonso and Hazard much ball on the left.\n\"We played well tactically because we allowed them to have the ball where we wanted, and we defended well,\" said Pellegrini.\n\"They played most of the game on their right side, so they didn't create too many chances.\"\nIn the end, Chelsea were grateful for Andriy Yarmokenko's glaring second-half miss, when he headed wide with only keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga to beat and the goal at his mercy, for not suffering their first defeat.\nThe visitors had chances of their own, with West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski saving well from substitutes Alvaro Morata and Ross Barkley - but in the end a draw was a fair result in a game that rarely sparked into life.\nIt is a result that drops Chelsea into third place behind Manchester City on goal difference and leaves Liverpool two points clear at the top of the table with a maximum return from their six games.\nAll of Sunday's Premier League action\nChelsea missing the magic touch\nHazard has been in magnificent form for Chelsea this season, exemplified by the superb hat-trick that inspired victory after they fell behind to Cardiff City at Stamford Bridge.\nOn Sunday, the brilliant Belgian was kept in check by West Ham and consequently the Blues' threat was hugely reduced, with winger Pedro injured and striker Olivier Giroud on the periphery.\nChelsea's best chance fell to the feet of substitute Morata after he replaced Giroud in the 65th minute, but he was thwarted by the bravery of Fabianski.\nIt summed up the visitors' frustration as their 100% winning start came to an end in a performance that was flat and lacking in energy, perhaps understandable after Thursday's trip to Greece to face PAOK in the Europa League.\nRoss Barkley almost snatched it late on with a long-range effort that brought another excellent save low to his left from Fabianski, but this was not a Chelsea display that deserved three points.\nThe Blues remain undefeated under Sarri in competitive action and, despite the dropped points here, this still represents a satisfactory start for the Italian.\nWest Ham rue Yarmolenko miss\nYarmolenko was voted man of the match by those who make the decision on behalf of West Ham - but in reality he was the villain of the piece despite another performance of promise.\nThe 28-year-old Ukrainian showed his class with two goals on his full debut in the 3-1 win at Everton, and almost delivered a trademark finish on Sunday when he cut inside and shot narrowly over with his left foot, his stock in trade.\nSadly for Yarmolenko and the Hammers, he missed his golden opportunity when it came at London Stadium - as substitute Robert Snodgrass landed a perfect cross on his head just six yards out at the far post in the second half.\nHowever, with Chelsea keeper Kepa totally exposed, Yarmolenko somehow directed his header wide when it was easier to score.\nIt was West Ham's last chance of a performance not short on endeavour but missing inspiration in attack without the talent and unpredictability of Marko Arnautovic.\nDeclan Rice's display was once again a major plus, the 19-year-old showing composure in a defensive midfield role as he adds another string to his bow after showing his talent as a central defender.\nWest Ham's fans greeted the final whistle and a point at home warmly - but the dejected Yarmolenko and manager Pellegrini will know it could have been three.\nBlues gear up for key week\nChelsea now face Liverpool twice in a week when we may get a more accurate measure of how far they have come under Sarri - and how far they still have to go after he succeeded Antonio Conte.\nThe Carabao Cup meeting at Anfield on Wednesday (19:45 BST kick-off) will merely be a warm-up - because both Sarri and his Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp are sure to play shadow teams.\nStamford Bridge will host the acid test in the Premier League at 17:30 on Saturday, with the Reds flying high after winning their first six league games for the first time in 28 years and Chelsea attempting to claw back the ground they lost here at London Stadium.\nIt is hardly a defining few days for either team with the season in its infancy - but it is certainly the opportunity to strike a psychological blow.\nMan of the match - Declan Rice (West Ham)\n'We needed to move the ball faster' - what they said\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was a good point against the leaders and a team that scored 14 goals in the first five games.\n\"It was a close game, and we had two clear chances and they had one.\n\"We would prefer to have some more possession, but it was a good tactical game and at least we did not lose it.\"\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri: \"We could have done better in the first half as we moved the ball slowly. In the second half, especially in the last 30 minutes, we played well - but we can do better.\n\"This was not our best performance. I knew West Ham are a very good team and they were confident after their win at Everton.\n\"We needed to move the ball faster - otherwise it is very difficult to create opportunities.\"\nJorginho the pass master - the stats\nWest Ham have avoided defeat in three consecutive Premier League games against Chelsea for the first time since a run of five between March 1998 and March 2000.\nChelsea failed to score in the league for the first time under Maurizio Sarri and for only the second time in their past 15 Premier League games (also in their 0-3 defeat at Newcastle in May).\nThis was only Chelsea's second goalless draw in their past 48 away league games.\nChelsea midfielder Jorginho attempted 180 passes in this match, the most by a player in a Premier League match since 2003-04.\nJorginho has completed 628 passes for Chelsea in the league this season, more than any other player.\nThis was Chelsea's 600th top-flight London derby and they become the third side to reach this number after Arsenal (674) and Tottenham (609).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Liverpool for a League Cup third-round tie at 19:45 BST on Wednesday, while West Ham host League Two Macclesfield at the same time."

We didn't control the match like we wanted to in the first half, but our goalkeeper had a good performance to keep us in it.\n\"We controlled the match better in the second half and didn't concede the chances we did in the first period. We finished the match with a smile on our face. We said we need a bit more at the break and the goal for Alex Lacazette is a good confidence-booster.\"\nEverton boss Marco Silva: \"The result didn't reflect the match. During the match we had four or five chances to score. Our team came to play and press high, but their goalkeeper is the best player on the pitch, and I think it reflects our performance.\n\"The result is disappointing for us. They had one chance and scored, and we created a lot of chances but didn't score.\n\"It is a clear offside for their second goal and it is a decision at an important stage, because at 1-0, we would have kept creating problems for them. I understand the job is difficult.\"\nGoals, goals, goals - the stats\nArsenal versus Everton is the highest-scoring fixture in Premier League era, with 153 goals.\nThe Gunners have won 97 top-flight games against Everton - at least 11 more than any side has managed against another in top-flight history.\nTwelve of Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette's 16 Premier League goals have been scored at Emirates Stadium - only Tony Adams, with 10 out of 12, scored a higher percentage of his league goals in home games for the Gunners (minimum 10 goals).\nArsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey has been directly involved in nine goals in his past five Premier League games against Everton (six goals, three assists).\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has conceded 18 goals in his five Premier League appearances against Arsenal, more than against any other side.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Brentford in the Carabao Cup third round on Wednesday (kick-off 19:45 BST), before welcoming Watford to the Emirates on Saturday.\nEverton are back in action next Saturday when they host Fulham in the Premier League (15:00 BST)."

Today was the test we needed to prove we can play as a big team. Not just to get a result defending against United or City or Chelsea. We work every day. That, to me more, makes me happy.\n\"The result is obviously most important. Three weeks ago I talked exactly the same after we lost four games, that we are not going to change. People thought that was crazy but that was the way. The team is making a difference, the players delivered a big performance.\"\nArnautovic's good form continues - the stats\nWest Ham enjoyed just their second win in their past 20 Premier League matches against Manchester United following a 3-2 victory at Upton Park in May 2016.\nWest Ham beat Manchester United by a two-goal margin in a league game for the first time since October 1982, also 3-1.\nManchester United have scored three Premier League own-goals in 2018, more than any other side.\nFelipe Anderson is only the second Brazilian to score for West Ham in the Premier League, after Ilan Araujo, who scored four for the club in 2010.\nPablo Zabaleta has registered 12 assists in 81 Premier League games under Manuel Pellegrini, compared with nine in 190 under other managers.\nMarcus Rashford has had a hand in four goals in six Premier League appearances against West Ham, scoring once.\nIn 2018, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, with 24, has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than Marko Arnautovic, on 17.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United host Valencia in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday (20:00 BST), before welcoming Newcastle to Old Trafford on Saturday (17:30 BST).\nWest Ham travel to face Brighton next Friday (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 0-2 Leicester: Foxes add to Magpies' problems\nNewcastle's miserable start to the season continued as goals from Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire gave Leicester a comfortable away victory.\nIn a game of few chances, striker Vardy broke the deadlock from the penalty spot on the half-hour mark after DeAndre Yedlin handled a Maguire shot.\nWith England manager Gareth Southgate watching at St James' Park, defender Maguire doubled the Foxes' lead with a second-half header.\nNewcastle remain without a win this season, and fans made their anger known in chants aimed at owner Mike Ashley throughout the game.\nAshley - attending his first home match since May 2017 - appeared to respond with wry smiles.\nMaddison 'definitely good enough for England'\nRicardo Pereira had the first chance to open the scoring for Leicester, cleverly cutting infield before his shot - destined for the bottom corner - was pushed wide by Martin Dubravka.\nVardy found a way through, though - coolly slotting home his third goal of the season.\nJonjo Shelvey went closest for Newcastle in the first half with a speculative lob from his own half which a back-tracking Kasper Schmeichel only just kept out.\nThe hosts looked more positive in the second half, but Maguire's second goal of the season consigned them to their fifth defeat of 2018-19.\nAshley anger continues to bubble\nAshley's first appearance of the season at a Newcastle match was for their goalless draw at Crystal Palace last weekend, with manager Rafa Benitez saying his presence was \"positive\" for the club.\nBut fans - angry at what they say is a lack of investment in the club - protested against the Magpies owner, who has been in charge since 2007, both before and during Leicester's visit to the north east.\nOn an otherwise quiet day at St James' Park, chants of 'stand up if you hate Ashley' were sung by the Newcastle faithful. Ashley appeared to smile in response.\nThe negative attitude was reflected on the pitch, too, with Newcastle limited to few chances and the visitors dominating.\nWith Shelvey's flamboyant effort arguably their best chance of the first half, Schmeichel was scarcely troubled after the break - substitute Jacob Murphy going closest late on when his shot from outside the area drifted wide.\nAyoze Perez did have two penalty appeals following challenges from Maguire, but both were waved away by referee Simon Hooper.\nSouthgate sees past, present and possibly future\nLeicester controlled play from the off, with James Maddison a constant threat through the middle.\nAfter Pereira's early effort, England international Maguire went close with a downward header, which Dubravka had to push over the crossbar.\nMaguire was involved in the penalty, too. After five consecutive Leicester corners, he went for a half-volley in the box which cannoned off Yedlin's arm.\nA composed Vardy finished neatly from the spot, the ball creeping under Dubravka, for his second goal in as many weekends.\nThe former England striker was left in a heap midway through the second half, however, after a painful collision with Shelvey, and was soon substituted.\nMaddison - rumoured to be in contention for a Three Lions call-up - was also replaced late on, leaving to a great reception from the travelling fans.\nMan of the match - Harry Maguire (Leicester)\nWhat they said\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez: \"Obviously I am disappointed. We conceded two goals from set-pieces and didn't take our chances.\n\"The second goal killed us mentally. Leicester were well-organised and worked hard and they have some good players.\n\"When you concede, it is always difficult for you. When things are not going in your favour you concede penalties like that.\n\"We have to manage the squad. We tried to be more offensive but we didn't take our chances and we were exposed in the second half. The team is working hard, you cannot complain about that.\n\"I have not spoken to Mike Ashley today, but if he is around it is positive. We have to concentrate with things on the pitch.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"Of course I am satisfied. It was a strong performance against a good team. We continue to play on the floor with quality.\n\"We had fantastic discipline. It was a tough game. People will say Newcastle are in difficulty but they have quality.\n\"Harry Maguire's first game of the season was difficult for him without much pre-season, but this afternoon he played very well. Congratulations to him. He always has a positive attitude and he is a fantastic guy.\n\"James Maddison continues to give his best and improve. He has to continue that work and we will see in the future.\"\nThe stats\nNewcastle have lost their opening four home games in a league season for the first time in their history.\nLeicester have won three consecutive away games in all competitions against Newcastle for the first time since November 1965.\nSince the start of last season, no team has lost more home Premier League games than Newcastle (11, level with Huddersfield).\nNewcastle failed to have a single shot on target against Leicester in the second half.\nMaddison has been directly involved in five goals in his past six Premier League games (three goals, two assists).\nMaguire has scored two goals in seven Premier League appearances this season, the same total he managed in 38 games for the Foxes in 2017-18.\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2014, only Manchester City have taken (33) and scored (25) more penalties than Leicester (31 taken, 24 scored).\nVardy has scored 11 of his 13 penalties taken in the Premier League, netting each of his past four efforts from the penalty spot.\nWhat's next?\nIt is a trip to Old Trafford for Newcastle next week as they face Manchester United in Saturday's late kick-off (17:30 BST), while Leicester welcome Everton to the King Power Stadium earlier in the day (15:00 BST)."

That's how football works.\"\nThe hosts started brightly but went behind when Kane headed in Kieran Trippier's right-wing cross.\nSpurs added a second when Danny Rose went down in the box after slight contact from Florent Hadergjonaj, with Kane sending Jonas Lossl the wrong way with the resulting penalty.\nLaurent Depoitre hit the bar, but the hosts rarely looked like mounting a comeback despite their hard work.\n\"We had chances, we were unlucky with the crossbar hit from Depoitre, and the penalty maybe was a soft one,\" said Wagner. \"We are unlucky at the moment.\"\nRelive the action here\nFollow reaction to all of today's games\nSpurs do enough to continue form\nTottenham moved into the top four with a comfortable victory - their third win in a row, including the midweek penalty shootout win over Watford in the Carabao Cup.\nWhile they were made to work, this game was so straightforward that Spurs were able to bring off Jan Vertonghen, who had a knock, and Mousa Dembele at half-time - perhaps with Wednesday's home Champions League game against Barcelona in mind.\nKane's three-game goalless run - a drought by his standards - is definitely over as he followed up his strike against Brighton last weekend with another two here, taking his tally for Spurs to 145.\nHe headed home Trippier's cross for the opener after good work by Lucas Moura, who was tackled but got up quickly to pass the ball out to the right-back.\nKane's second was more controversial because Rose went down easily in the box after a tug on the shirt from substitute Hadergjonaj. The home fans were furious but the England striker did not care as he slotted home.\n\"He is looking a lot more like his usual self,\" former Tottenham player Danny Murphy said on Match of the Day. \"He went past players and was running the channels. He played as well as he has in a while.\n\"Everything good that Spurs did came through him.\"\nSpurs' front three were all lively - with Moura and Son Heung-min forcing saves from Lossl and linking up well together. But in reality, there was barely any need to even play the second half because the game was done by the 34th minute.\n\"It was a very good win, I'm very pleased,\" Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said. \"The attitude was fantastic. It was a tough game against a team desperate to win. They were helped by their unbelievable fans, among the best I have found in England.\n\"We are in the Premier League, it is tough, physical. Teams like Huddersfield are difficult to play. They have very good players - with the atmosphere and the manager, they will bounce back.\"\nA long season ahead for Huddersfield\nHuddersfield battled gamely and worked hard, but they are really missing an attacking spark, a problem they have had all season. They have yet to score a home goal in four games.\nThey started brightly - dominating possession - but still Spurs had three shots from not many attacks before the Terriers had one themselves.\nDavid Wagner's side, who are bottom of the table with two points from seven games, lost Terence Kongolo to injury in the first half - and his replacement Hadergjonaj conceded the penalty.\nHuddersfield resorted to long Philip Billing throw-ins time and time again to little effect, apart from one which was cleared to Chris Lowe - but his 25-yard belter was saved well by Spurs' third-choice keeper Paulo Gazzaniga.\nThat was one of few clear chances for the hosts to score. Depoitre volleyed off the crossbar in first-half injury time and substitute Isaac Mbenza forced a good save in the second half, but they never looked likely to find a way back into the game.\n\"Unfortunately we are without goals and points again,\" said Wagner. \"But we need to be independent of points and the table and focus on the performance.

The Wales international failed to influence the game, while Iwobi added pace to midfield to complement the speed of Arsenal's front two on the break.\nIt was from two swift attacks that Arsenal broke the deadlock. Iwobi first sped down the left before delivering a cross that the unfortunate Cathcart converted under pressure from Lacazette.\nArsenal caught out Watford again moments later, Ozil capping a move that was typical of those created during the pomp of Wenger's reign.\nBefore the goals, Lacazette was the biggest threat on the pitch, but he wasted two good chances - a one-on-one with keeper Ben Foster and a header over the bar from eight yards.\nHowever, Emery stuck by Lacazette - a \u00a346.5m signing in 2017 - and he played a big part in the two goals.\n\"When Iwobi came on, he made a real difference,\" Keown added. \"Emery seems to have brought enjoyment back for some of the players and is pushing the club away from the Arsene Wenger era.\"\nRelive the action from Emirates Stadium\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nLeno keeps cool on league debut\nPetr Cech's hamstring injury in first-half stoppage time led to the league debut for \u00a319m summer signing Leno.\nThe 26-year-old German produced an exceptional low save to deny Deeney and also produced a great block to stop Andre Gray.\nLeno might keep hold of the jersey after Emery suggested Cech will be out for two to three weeks.\nSuccess makes impact, but too late for Hornets\nWatford began the match with 13 points from their opening six games - and above Arsenal in the table for the first time since 1984.\nThe outcome could have been different had Deeney and Gray put away their chances.\nNigeria striker Success, who came on in the 72nd minute, also went close.\nThe 22-year-old, who scored in the League Cup defeat by Tottenham on Wednesday, had a goalbound shot blocked by Holding before his angled strike narrowly drifted past Leno's far post.\nMan of the match - Rob Holding (Arsenal)\n'The players are frustrated' - manager quotes\nWatford boss Javi Gracia: \"I am very upset for my players because they deserved more; a better result.\n\"We had a very good performance, with more shots, with a lot of clear chances to score. We deserved more. I'm sure the right results (will come).\n\"We are competing well in all the games.

An impressive team move ended with Ryan Sessegnon firing against the bar from close range.\nFulham arguably had the better chances in the first half and had five shots compared to Everton's one.\nAleksandar Mitrovic and Andre Schurrle found space in similar positions on the edge of the box in quick succession, but both fired over Jordan Pickford's goal.\nJokanovic was forced to make an early change when Timothy Fosu-Mensah was carried off on a stretcher with a shoulder injury after landing awkwardly.\nHis replacement, Cyrus Christie, struggled to cope with Richarlison and was booked after a number of clumsy challenges on the Brazilian.\nFulham failed to muster a single shot on target in the 90 minutes and have now scored only three goals in four away league games this season. They have now lost four straight league games against Everton for the first time.\nToffees dominate second half\nWhatever Everton boss Marco Silva said at half-time clearly did the job.\nHis side came out attacking and almost took the lead three minutes after the restart. A Sigurdsson corner found Michael Keane, who nodded down to Richarlison, but the Brazilian's acrobatic effort at the far post was just over Bettinelli's bar.\nKurt Zouma headed over shortly after before Everton's first clear-cut chance came when Dominic Calvert-Lewin was fouled in the box.\nIt looked as though referee Roger East had initially dismissed the claims, but assistant referee Andy Garrett spotted the shove from Denis Odoi and the penalty was eventually awarded.\nIt was the first Premier League spot-kick missed by Sigurdsson, who scored his previous six.\nBut just four minutes later, Jonjoe Kenny's low drive into the box was booted away by Odoi, straight into the path of Sigurdsson who curled in from just outside the box.\nAt 1-0 down, Fulham had another decent chance on the hour mark when Andre Schurrle squared it to Luciano Vietto, but the Argentine's touch was too heavy and Jordan Pickford raced out to gather the ball.\nTosun replaced Calvert-Lewin shortly before Sigurdsson's goal, and got in on the action himself when he headed in his first goal of the season from Walcott's chipped cross.\nAnother substitute, Bernard, made an impact in the dying minutes when his pass picked out Sigurdsson on the edge of the box, the Icelandic rolling past Bettinelli to cap another miserable afternoon at Goodison for Fulham.\nWhilst the three points are most important, Everton will also take confidence from keeping a clean sheet for the first time this season.\nMan of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson (Everton)\n'We must fight like it's the last second in our life' - what they said\nEverton manager Marco Silva: \"It's important to be clear what we did in the second half was really different. We have to be more aggressive than our opponents but sometimes we have to be more calm. We changed our team a little bit higher and our pressure was better in the second half.\n\"Of course it's important to get three points but the clean sheet is really important as well.\n\"Sigurdsson showed fantastic character and personality after he missed the penalty and deserved the goals because he works hard. Today, football was fair with him because he works hard.\n\"We have to think always about winning. The last two results were really disappointing for us and we had to react and that's what we did. The first half wasn't the best but the game is 90 minutes.\"\nFulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic: \"We must be more clinical in important moments in this competition. We had one clear chance from Schurrle, and also Sessegnon hit the crossbar, but we didn't score and they fought harder and scored three easy goals.\n\"We must show more solidarity and fight like it's the last second in our life. In one moment we give up and trust that we can change the situation and this is not acceptable.\n\"I cannot be frustrated, I must open my mind and find the solution. We need to improve many things and we must believe in ourselves and find the way for improvement.\"\n22 successive wins for Everton - the stats\nEverton have won their past 22 top-flight home games against Fulham - a record in English top division football.\nFulham haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their past 22 away Premier League games, the longest ongoing run in the division (current clubs only).\nEverton have won all 14 of their Premier League home games against Fulham by an aggregate score of 35-7, the best 100% win record against a team on home soil in the competition.\nSince his maiden season in the Premier League in 2011-12, Gylfi Sigurdsson has netted 18 goals from outside the box in the competition, a haul only Philippe Coutinho can better (19).\nEverton winger Theo Walcott has had a hand in four goals in his past five Premier League home games (two goals, two assists), as many as he managed in his previous 13 in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nEverton host Southampton in the EFL Cup third round on Tuesday (kick-off 19:45 BST), before a trip to Leicester City next Saturday (15:00).\nFulham are back in action on Sunday, 7 October when they welcome Arsenal to Craven Cottage in the Premier League (kick-off 12:00)."

At the other end, the home side managed 61.\nChris Hughton's side as good as matched City in terms of work-rate, collectively covering only 1km less, but that was the only area on the pitch where there was not a noticeable gulf.\nTheir only positives came at the back - through the organisation of their defence and also a collection of fine saves by Ryan that helped keep the scoreline respectable.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\n'We are so fast on the counter-attack' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, asked to describe his side's performance: \"Outstanding. Our positional game was fantastic and we didn't concede much in shots, and we did it so good.\n\"Brighton defended so well and I give a lot of credit to the way we attacked today. We are so fast on the counter-attack and it was quite similar last season.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"The second goal was frustrating. They counter-attack very fast and very well. It's a typical Manchester City goal - at 1-0 we were always in the game but the second goal killed us.\n\"You don't want to get beaten but it's how you get beaten and these are the type of places where you can get beaten big. We had a goalkeeper who had to make big saves and defenders who had to block shots, so we did well to survive here.\nOn his side's penalty appeal after the ball appeared to hit Fernandinho's arm: \"We had a penalty given against us last game [against Tottenham] for a Glenn Murray handball. I had no problems with that, but here you need as many decisions going for you and I saw the ball hit his hand on the video replay so it's a definite penalty.

And we have to try to improve more.\"\nEden Hazard's 25th-minute strike, driven low past Alisson, had threatened to be his second match-winner of the week against Liverpool.\nThe Reds wasted a host of opportunities before Daniel Sturridge curled a magnificent shot into the top corner from 25 yards to rescue a point in the 89th minute.\nKlopp was pleased with the striker's contribution but felt his side should have taken more from the game.\n\"What a spectacular football game,\" he said. \"We had many chances and played fantastic football.\n\"Getting a point at Chelsea is always a good result but if we play like that, we will win plenty of games.\"\nThe best goals-per-minute record in the league - Sturridge renaissance continues\nWhy both managers can be happy...\nSarri and Klopp smiled and embraced warmly at the final whistle of a high-class encounter that left them with mixed emotions.\nSarri will have been disappointed to see Chelsea concede so late but will have taken much pleasure from aspects of a performance that confirmed they have the qualities to remain in the race at the top of the Premier League this season.\nWith this result on the back of the Carabao Cup in midweek, Sarri can look back on a highly satisfactory start to his Chelsea reign.\nKlopp will feel the negative of the end of Liverpool's 100% start to the Premier League season - but he can reflect on a performance that resulted in so many chances created on opposition territory against a team they will rightly regard as close rivals in pursuit of the title.\nHe would have shaken his head in disbelief had Liverpool left Stamford Bridge empty-handed given the golden opportunities they let slip through their grasp. Liverpool, no matter how late they left it, deserved their point.\nIn the final reckoning, however, both Chelsea and Liverpool remain unbeaten with five and six league wins respectively - although the sight of City above them even after that superb opening is an ominous one.\nSturridge sensational but Salah struggles\nSturridge's spectacular late equaliser was another reminder that beneath the injury problems and time on the sidelines lurks arguably England's most naturally gifted striker.\nThe last time he played at Stamford Bridge was on 12 January during a miserable loan spell with West Bromwich Albion. He limped off with a hamstring injury after only four minutes and did not play a full game for the rest of the season.\nThis was a different story.\nLiverpool had tried just about everything and missed all manner of chances when Sturridge, with as much nonchalance as brilliance, looked up and sent a 25-yard finish in an arc past the stretching Kepa.\nSturridge combines athleticism and in-bred goalscoring instinct, as he proved with his bicycle kick in midweek, and would be a certainty for Gareth Southgate's England squad if he could string together a sequence of games.\nAs Sturridge walked off, taking the acclaim from Liverpool's fans, he cut a stark contrast with Salah, who did not last much longer than an hour against his former club and continues to struggle for form.\nIt is hardly crisis time for the Egyptian, who was never likely to repeat his 44-goal feat of last season, but he looks low on confidence - although he possesses such quality it is surely only a matter of time before he returns to his best.\nSalah had three opportunities in the first half, with one finish weak and another wayward before he was denied by Antonio Rudiger's superb goalline clearance.\nIt simply was not his day, a fact accepted by Klopp as last term's talisman was removed and replaced by Xherdan Shaqiri midway through the second half.\nHazard holds key to Chelsea's ambitions\nHazard, as he had at Anfield in midweek, threatened to be the difference between two very good teams as he punished Liverpool once more when he raced away and finished across Alisson in the first half.\nHe is, without argument, in the highest echelon of players in the world and his quality was reflected in the reaction of Klopp on several occasions when his side presented possession to the Belgian in dangerous positions.\nEach time, Klopp clasped his hands to his Liverpool cap in a mixture of exasperation and anxiety, already well aware of the damage Hazard can do.\nPut simply, if Hazard continues this form, Chelsea and Sarri have every chance of challenging for honours this season.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nA draw was right - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri: \"I am really happy with the performance.

He also had a credible penalty shout waved away seconds before the interval, when Matt Lowton handled his acrobatic effort.\nThere was superb composure to Murphy's strike - his first Premier League goal - and V\u00edctor Camarasa found himself in a good position but missed from 12 yards.\nBut they were hit on the break for the Clarets winner and with a game against Spurs at Wembley before the international break, things are not going to get any easier for Cardiff.\nHart inspires Burnley revival?\nWhile Burnley are yet to come close to hitting the heights they reached last season, goalkeeper Joe Hart has contributed to their improved form of late.\nThe Clarets have won back-to-back Premier League matches for the first time this season, and they achieved this victory despite losing defender James Tarkowski to injury during the first half.\nTheir ability to get a foothold in the game was, at least in part, down to Hart, who produced several excellent saves.\nHe twice kept his side level in the first half, first stooping low to his left to deny Zohore, who poked at goal after collecting Camarasa's pass.\nHart also stood strong to deny the lively Murphy on 17 minutes, a strong arm diverting a fierce drive on to the post.\nHis best save, however, came on 67 minutes when he superbly tipped over a Murphy effort that seemed destined to give Cardiff the lead.\nAfterwards boss Sean Dyche said his side should have had a penalty when Sean Morrison appeared to haul back Vokes.\nBut an improved performance after the break saw Gudmundsson head home at the far post and Vokes strike the winner with a deft finish.\nMan of the match - Johann Berg Gudmundsson (Burnley)\n'We can't play much better than that' - what they said\nCardiff City manager Neil Warnock: \"It is a cruel game sometimes, but I can't fault the effort. They had two shots and you can't concede goals like that. We didn't get the rub of the green. From Paterson's overhead kick, we should have a clear penalty.\n\"We can't get much more out of the players but we make errors and they punish you. We could have taken more opportunities too - that little bit of finishing is what you pay for. We are just lacking a little bit of quality in that area.\n\"It is a blow to lose a game like today, because we can't play much better than that.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"A week ago there were a few stories knocking around. Now we've won two in a row - one at home, one away - and the stories change.\n\"There are a lot of things to be pleased with, particularly the three points. It was a mixed bag and in the first half Cardiff did so well, we couldn't get a foothold into the game.\n\"Over a season you won't dominate every week, you have to show a willingness to fight, a desire to win. There are no easy games against Neil Warnock sides and we knew that would be the case. Winning home and away changes the mentality\u2026 belief comes back into the group.\"\nCardiff's tough start - the stats\nWith Cardiff, Newcastle and Huddersfield all yet to win, this is just the third time in Premier League history that as many as three teams have failed to record a win in their opening seven games of a campaign. It also happened in 2004-05 and 2012-13.\nCardiff have failed to win each of their opening eight games of a season in all competitions for just the second time since 1964-65.\nThe Bluebirds are winless in their past 11 games in the Premier League, losing eight and conceding 26 goals, with six scored.\nBurnley have recorded back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since April, having gone 10 games without a victory.\nThis was Burnley's first victory over Cardiff in all competitions since a 2-0 win in April 2007, having failed to win any of the previous 13.\nSince the start of last season, Gudmundsson has been directly involved in 14 Premier League goals, more than any other Clarets player.\nThe Ken quiz...\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Huddersfield at Turf Moor on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Cardiff travel to face Tottenham the same afternoon."

You could say we shaded it and deserved to win - Roy may say differently.\n\"We have confidence that we have a goal in us at any time, and we have matchwinners who can turn the game. The togetherness and the spirit in the group is as good as it's ever been.\nOn David Brooks, Howe said: \"He's got outstanding technical qualities and I believe he's a goalscorer in waiting - his finishing's improving and it was a really good team move.\n\"The potential of his performances is huge. I felt he deserved to start the season, he was magnificent in the last friendly against Marseille and he's stayed in on merit. He's not been overawed by the Premier League.\"\nCherries end Monday night hoodoo - the best stats\nBournemouth have won a Premier League game on a Monday for the first time, at their sixth attempt (D1 L4).\nCrystal Palace have won just one of their past six top-flight games (D1 L4), after winning each of the four before that.\nCallum Wilson has been directly involved in four goals in his past four home Premier League games for Bournemouth (1 goal, 3 assists), one more than he managed in his previous 12.\nSince the start of last season, Crystal Palace's Patrick van Aanholt has scored six Premier League goals; among defenders, only Marcos Alonso has more (8), with Nacho Monreal also on six.\nWilfried Zaha has had a hand in 10 goals in his past 12 Premier League appearances (8 goals, 2 assists), one more goal involvement than he managed in his 32 games before that (9).\nBournemouth's Junior Stanislas has scored in three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since November 2009 with West Ham.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace host Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 BST kick-off) while Bournemouth travel to Watford the same day."

The other was Gareth McAuley.\nWest Ham have lost seven of their past 10 away Premier League games (W2 D1).\n27% of Brighton's wins in the Premier League have been against West Ham (3 of 11).\n'We were better than Brighton' - what they said\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton on Sky Sports: \"As the game went on we rode our luck but sometimes you need that. It's a first clean sheet of the season for us and you need a goalscorer. In the end it was our night.\n\"We had to work hard for it. We made a lot of poor choices on the ball. They are a good side with really good forward options. We had periods of the game where we defended well from the front.\n\"It's a massive win for us.\"\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"I am frustrated because I think we do the things to win the game. We had three clear chances to score and didn't. They had one chance in the first half and then defended. We deserved more.\n\"The first 35 minutes we were not at the pace needed, especially to fight for the second balls. The team is in progress.

        "article_text": "Watford 0-4 Bournemouth: King scores twice as Cherries go fifth\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe says his team \"still have room to improve\" after they humbled a poor Watford side to move up to fifth in the Premier League.\nDavid Brooks opened the scoring for the Cherries before Joshua King converted from the spot after being brought down by Christian Kabasele, who was sent off for a second bookable offence.\nThe Norwegian forward then added a third for Bournemouth in first-half injury time, and Callum Wilson wrapped up the win early in the second half.\nThe victory was Bournemouth's biggest away win in the Premier League.\n\"It wasn't perfect,\" Howe told BBC Sport. \"I'm pleased but we have room to improve and grow from today. Watford made it difficult, even with 10 [men], but we were professional.\n\"It's a great start. It is so early it is difficult to make predictions. All we can do is work and try to achieve what our limit is.\"\nAs it happened: Watford 0-4 Bournemouth\nWhat else happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nWatford looked confident in the early stages, with their best chances falling to Will Hughes, who drew a good save from Asmir Begovic with a shot from the edge of the area.\nHowever, once Kabasele had seen red after 32 minutes, they were never able to find a foothold in the game and Bournemouth played through their lines with ease.\nThe Cherries had chances to further their advantage in the second half. King fired straight at Ben Foster when crossing may have been the better option, and Ryan Fraser was tackled with King and Wilson in space.\nBut Eddie Howe's team were unable to add to their four-goal lead, to the relief of the home crowd, who will not remember Vicarage Road's 100th Premier League fixture fondly.\nCherries impress again as strong start continues\nBournemouth's win, their biggest away from home in the Premier League since the 3-0 victory at Chelsea in January, was richly deserved.\nThey weathered an early storm from Watford and went ahead early through Brooks, who finished off a lightning counter-attack spearheaded by the excellent King.\nKing was again at the heart of the play for the second goal. He won the penalty, drawing a clumsy foul from Kabasele, before converting the resulting spot-kick.\nWilson has been one of Bournemouth's star performers this season, and his floated cross for King was perfectly weighted, giving the Norwegian a golden opportunity to make it three, which he duly did.\nAnd Wilson, who this week missed out on a first England call-up, got himself on the scoresheet two minutes after the break when he controlled Fraser's cross brilliantly before tapping in.\nHowe will also be delighted with how his back four defended, with Nathan Ake the stand-out performer as they kept a clean sheet for the first time in 10 away league games.\nBournemouth have now taken 16 points from their opening eight league games - last season, it took them 16 matches to reach that tally.\nWith Southampton up next in two weeks, they will hope the forthcoming international break does not halt their momentum.\nWatford blown away\nComing into this match, the sides were level on points and could only be separated on goal difference. But there was clear water between them on a wet afternoon in Hertfordshire.\nThe Hornets had not lost at home to Bournemouth since 1997 and started reasonably well, but Troy Deeney and Andre Gray were unable to capitalise on the half-chances that came their way.\nAnd after they went behind to Brooks' second goal in as many games, Watford offered little.\nWhen Kabasele saw red, Javi Gracia opted to drop Etienne Capoue into central defence alongside Craig Cathcart, a decision that proved costly.\nBournemouth scored two further goals with Capoue at centre-back, and captain Deeney was visibly annoyed at the Frenchman after Wilson's goal.\nMaybe it was Deeney's displeasure that prompted Gracia to bring on Adrian Mariappa, a recognised centre-back, in the 55th minute. But by then, it was too late.\nAfter winning their first four league games of the season, the Hornets have now gone four without victory and are ninth in the table.\nThe international break has perhaps come at a good time for Gracia and his team, who have two weeks to prepare for their trip to in-form Wolves, where they will look to rediscover their early season sharpness.\nMan of the match - Nathan Ake (Bournemouth)\n'We're capable of beating anyone' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We are very pleased with the result. This is a tough place to come and Watford have been in good form.\n\"We believe we are capable of beating anyone when we are on top of our game. We like to stay in the background and as underdogs. We will go about our work in a controlled way.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is always a bad moment to lose like today. Today is the first day we haven't competed as in other games. They were much better than us. We will try to improve for the next game.\"\nIll-disciplined Watford - the best of the stats\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2015-16, Watford have been shown more red cards than any other side in the competition (13).\nBournemouth are just the second side to beat Watford by four or more goals in the Premier League at Vicarage Road, after Man City (0-5 in May 2017 and 0-6 in September 2017).\nWatford have conceded 19 penalties in the Premier League since the start of the 2015-16 season. Only West Ham (22) have given away more.\nBournemouth scored four goals away from home in a Premier League game for only the second time, and the first since August 2015 (4-3 at West Ham).\nBournemouth's Joshua King has scored 34 goals in the Premier League - only four Norwegians have scored more (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Steffen Iversen, John Carew and Tore Andre Flo).\nBournemouth's David Brooks has scored in successive league games for the first time in his career.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Watford travel to Molineux to face Wolves on Saturday 20 October, and Bournemouth host Southampton on the same day. Both games kick off at 15:00 BST."

We dominated the game, we played decent football and created opportunities with lots of crosses but in the end Burnley made lots of blocks.\n\"We have to win it, everyone who's seen the game knew we were the better team. The performance was very good and I'm very confident going forward because we came here today and played the football we wanted.\nHuddersfield Town defender Christopher Schindler: \"I don't think my injury was deliberate, he [Chris Wood] tried to create space for himself and caught me.\n\"I felt the blood pouring right away so knew I needed to get some medical attention, especially with a head injury.\n\"Today was our best performance in the Premier League this season, it's a shame we didn't go on to win but we'll take the point.\"\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski (Burnley)\nTerriers' wait for win goes on - the stats\nBurnley have taken seven points from their past three Premier League games (W2 D1), after picking up just three points in the 10 before that (D3).\nSam Vokes has scored in consecutive Premier League games for Burnley for the first time since August 2017.\nFour of Sam Vokes' last five Premier League goals for Burnley have been headers, with three of those assisted by Johann Berg Gudmundsson.\nBurnley's Gudmundson has registered four Premier League assists, a joint-high figure in the division this season (level with Manchester City's Benjamin Mendy, Watford's Jose Holebas and Bournemouth's Callum Wilson).\nChristopher Schindler scored for the first time in his last 66 league appearances for Huddersfield, previously netting against Ipswich in January 2017 in the Championship.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Burnley return to Premier League action with a trip to last season's champions Manchester City on Saturday, 20 October (15:00 BST).\nOn the same day, Huddersfield welcome Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool to the John Smith's Stadium in the evening kick-off (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 1-2 Everton: Gylfi Sigurdsson scores stunning goal to beat 10-man Foxes\nGylfi Sigurdsson's stunning second-half strike gave Everton a 2-1 win against 10-man Leicester, after Wes Morgan was sent-off for the second time in three league games.\nThe Iceland midfielder struck in the 77th minute, skilfully turning away from James Maddison with a Cruyff turn and bending an effort from 25 yards into the top corner.\nJust 14 minutes earlier, Foxes captain Morgan received his second booking in 20 minutes for a foul on Richarlison.\nRicharlison had put Everton ahead on seven minutes with a close-range volley, set up by some wonderful trickery by fellow Brazilian Bernard, who was making his first Premier League start since his summer move from Shakhtar Donetsk.\nJust before half-time Ricardo Pereira scored a deserved equaliser for Leicester, which came from an Everton corner.\nThe Portuguese full-back led a counter-attack, exchanging passes with Kelechi Iheanacho, then left Toffees defender Jonjoe Kenny on the floor as he twisted and turned inside the box before firing in at Jordan Pickford's near post - the final touch coming off the England keeper.\nLeicester continued to push for an equaliser after Sigurdsson's goal and deep into injury time, with Schmeichel joining the attack for a corner, Daniel Amartey missed a free header from close range.\nEverton have their first back-to-back wins this season and their first away win, to move up to 10th, while Leicester are in ninth.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nSamba boys & Sigurdsson show Everton future\nEverton started the match without a striker but their front four of Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Bernard and Theo Walcott gave them plenty of firepower.\nRicharlison was the furthest forward of the quartet and continued his goal scoring form since his \u00a335m summer move with his fourth league goal of the season.\nHe linked up well with Bernard, who showed that he can provide plenty of entertainment for Toffees fans this season.\nFor the opener, he broke free down the left, dribbling past Amartey and Pereira, and then chipped across the box, which Schmeichel could only parry into the path of Richarlison.\nThey almost had a second moment later as Sigurdsson almost got onto the end of Richarlison's scuffed shot.\nWalcott and Sigurdsson also had efforts saved from distance by Schmeichel in the first-half, which they just edged and they pressed for the winner after Morgan's sending-off.\nThat came from a moment of magic from Sigurdsson who scored his 50th in the Premier League and his 19th from outside the box.\nIt was the 29-year-old's fifth of the season in all competitions - his fourth in the league and the same amount as last term - as the club-record signing begins to repay the \u00a345m Everton spent on him August 2017.\n\"It was fantastic for Gylfi,\" said Everton boss Marco Silva. \"His quality in that moment showed how good he is and the way he took the ball and shot was fantastic.\n\"He's playing a different role [to last season] and our style is completely different. It fits his profile better.\n\"He has worked to get ready for this, working in training with great intensity. It's not just what he gives us with the ball but also what he is giving us without the ball.\"\nSilva added: \"We deserve to take the three points. This is our image. It will be so in the future more and more, I don't have doubts about that,\" he said. \"But we have many things to do to keep improving.\"\nMorgan red changes game\nLeicester boss Claude Puel felt Morgan's 63rd-minute sending-off changed the game.\nHe admitted his side had started slowly, but they did grow into the first-half with Jamie Vardy flicking a header narrowly wide. The former England striker also went on a trademark run, latching onto a long ball and outsprinting Michael Keane, but he prodded a shot past the post with just Pickford to beat.\nMorgan, who was sent-off against Bournemouth on 15 September, picked up his first booking for a foul on Richarlison on 43 minutes, just after Pereira's goal.\nBen Chilwell fired just over the bar after the break, but Morgan then went through the back of Richarlison and was given his marching orders.\nIheanacho was the man sacrificed as Marc Albrighton came on to sure up the Leicester defence and Schmeichel kept them in it with a double save - a long-range effort from Lucas Digne and then a sidefooted shot from Tom Davies.\nBut there was nothing the Dane could do for the winner.\nJames Maddison, who was called up by England for the first time on Thursday, barely threatened in the game.\n\"The sending-off changes the scenario of the game,\" said Puel. \"We had come back into the game with Ricardo's goal and started the second-half well, with good intensity.\n\"After the sending-off we did not manage the game well. I am not sure it deserved a second yellow but we have to manage it better.\"\nMan of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson\nStats - Sigurdsson closes in on Gudjohnsen\nSigurdsson scored his 50th Premier League goal, the second Icelandic player to reach the milestone in the competition after former Bolton and Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen, who scored 55.\nSigurdsson has scored 19 Premier League goals from outside the box - no player has more since his debut in the competition, level with Philippe Coutinho.\nRicharlison has scored four goals in his six Premier League appearances for Everton this season - just one fewer than he scored in 38 games for Watford last term.\nMorgan has been sent off in two of his last three Premier League games. He'd only seen red in one of his previous 137 in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Everton host Crystal Palace on 21 October and Leicester travel to Arsenal on 22 October."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Cardiff City: Eric Dier goal gives Spurs win at Wembley\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said his side \"need to improve a lot\" despite edging to victory over Cardiff to equal their best start to a Premier League season.\nEric Dier scored the only goal of the game in the eighth minute, tapping in a loose ball from inside the six-yard box from a corner.\nCardiff, who had to play most of the second half with 10 men after Joe Ralls was sent off in the 58th minute, remain without a win this season and fall to bottom of the table.\nSpurs have 18 points after eight games - their joint-best total - and are third in the table, one point behind leaders Manchester City, who are ahead of Liverpool on goal difference.\nTheir next match is against West Ham on 20 October after the international break, their first of seven games in 22 days.\n\"We are one point off the top of the Premier League but we need to improve a lot,\" Pochettino said.\n\"Now we have two weeks before the next game - but it is a very tough schedule when we return.\"\nSpurs produced a lethargic performance against a battling Cardiff, who could have equalised midway through the first half but Toby Alderweireld cleared Josh Murphy's effort off the line.\nThe hosts lost their way after going in front but improved at the end of the first half, with Lucas Moura missing two good chances and Son Heung-min also shooting over.\nImmediately after half-time, Cardiff captain Sean Morrison brilliantly blocked Moura's shot on the line after Harry Kane's initial header had been saved.\nRalls was then sent off for a cynical challenge on Moura but minutes later Morrison had a header turned onto the post by Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.\nRelive the action from Wembley\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nSpurs just do enough\nIt seems remarkable that Spurs were described as a club in \"mini-crisis\"\n, external\nlast month after losing three consecutive games - because now they have achieved their joint-best start to a season.\nThat tricky period at the start of September included league defeats by Liverpool and Watford as well as a Champions League defeat to Inter Milan.\nThe three points against Cardiff were secured despite a ponderous display which came three days after Spurs were beaten in an enthralling encounter in the Champions League by Barcelona.\nPochettino made just three changes to his team, although he had little other option with key first-team players Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen all injured.\nSpurs' build-up play was slow and the movement up front was not as evident as in previous games.\nWhen they did create chances they were wasteful. Moura headed off target in the first half and put a shot from seven yards wide, although in the second half he could have done little more with his shot that was brilliantly blocked by Morrison.\nCaptain Harry Kane was quiet. His two shots on target were a shot from distance in the first half and a header at the start of the second.\nCardiff show fight but lack quality\nThe defeat is Cardiff's fifth in a row in the league and leaves them in 20th place after Huddersfield grabbed a point at Burnley.\nThe results look bleak for the Welsh side but there were positives in the performance that will please Neil Warnock.\nSome might have expected Cardiff to fold after going behind early on, but instead they were the better side for 20 minutes after Dier's goal.\nThey would have scored in that spell but for Alderweireld's goalline clearance, which was made even more impressive by the fact Junior Hoilett was closing in to tap home Murphy's initial shot.\nCardiff also defended valiantly when Spurs did attack, with Morrison and fellow centre-back Sol Bamba repeatedly using their body to block shots.\nManager Neil Warnock looked furious with Spurs' players after Ralls was sent off, and afterwards suggested they had influenced referee Mike Dean's decision.\nRalls' tackle was not dangerous - nor was he the last man in defence - but as he made no attempt to player the ball Dean chose to dismiss the midfielder.\n\"I don't think Mike Dean would have given a red card by himself,\" Warnock said. \"I think there were too many voices around him that changed his mind.\n\"Players and officials all want to get in on the act and make headlines, but it's little old Cardiff isn't it?\"\nCardiff again responded well to this setback, hitting the post through Morrison - but in the end the tiredness of playing with 10 men meant they were not able to push for an equaliser late on.\nMan of the match - Sean Morrison (Cardiff)\n'Little old Cardiff' - manager quotes\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said: \"After Barcelona on Wednesday, the most important thing was to win. We created a lot of chances but we didn't kill the game. I'm happy to finish with 18 points going into the international break. We only conceded a few chances and we finished the game on top.\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock said: \"When I look at Danny Rose's challenge on Bruno Manga, that is worse [than Ralls' challenge] in terms of violent conduct.\n\"But we kept our discipline and we kept going, so there were lots of positives. To see Spurs keep it in the corner against 10 men shows how well we did. I'm disappointed on the goal - it's a nothing cross - but you thought that would open the floodgates and I'm delighted with how we stuck at it.\"\nKane's struggles against Cardiff - the best stats\nTottenham are unbeaten in their past 38 Premier League home games against promoted sides (W35 D3).\nCardiff are winless in their first eight games to a league season for the third time, and first since 1989-90 in the old Division Three.\nThe Bluebirds have lost five consecutive Premier League games, their worst run ever in the competition.\nTottenham have scored at least once in each of their past 19 Premier League home games, the longest current run in the competition.\nCardiff had six shots on target in this match, the most they have managed in a Premier League game this season.\nCardiff remain the only side Tottenham striker Harry Kane has faced but not scored against in the Premier League. The England forward had six shots on Saturday, more than any other player in the match.\nSpurs' Dier scored his first Premier League goal in 546 days, since netting against Watford at White Hart Lane in April 2017.\nRalls' red card was only Cardiff's second in the Premier League, with Juan Cala against Sunderland in April 2014 the other.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham's next match comes at West Ham on 20 October following the international break. Cardiff host Fulham on the same day."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-1 Wolves: Matt Doherty winner extends Wolves' unbeaten run\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson described his side's performance as a \"major disappointment\" after Matt Doherty's winner extended Wolves' unbeaten Premier League run to six matches.\nRaul Jimenez put Doherty through on 56 minutes and, despite the tight angle, the full-back was able to beat Wayne Hennessey at his near post.\nAlthough the home side began confidently in the first ever Premier League meeting between the clubs, Hodgson's team were wasteful in the final third.\n\"We did not take our chances,\" the former England manager said. \"At the end it became a desperation type of performance, where we are hoping things will happen.\n\"Once again we were not good enough in and around the penalty box to create the clear-cut opportunities we need to score a goal. It is a major disappointment.\"\nRui Patricio had produced an excellent double save as Wolves held onto the win, first stopping Max Meyer's volley and then blocking Wilfried Zaha's follow-up as the hosts chased a first home goal of the campaign.\nSubstitute Ivan Cavaleiro then struck the bar late on as Wolves achieved their best run in the top flight since 1979, and left Hodgson's side with just one win in their past seven league games.\nThe action as it happened at Selhurst Park\nWhat else happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nPatient Wolves rewarded\nNuno Espirito Santo set a Premier League record by naming an unchanged starting XI for an eighth consecutive opening fixture, and Wolves arrived at Selhurst Park as the in-form side.\nThe visitors had to be patient to force a decisive breakthrough against Southampton last time out, and it was a similar story in south London, where the hosts began largely in control.\nBut Nuno's men have remained committed to their expansive style of play - and once again that paid off as the adventurous Doherty unlocked the Palace defence with a great finish.\nIt's no coincidence that eight of Wolves' nine league goals have come in the second half, and they demonstrated their ability to gradually wear down their opponents' resistance.\nWhile their attacking players will continue to receive plaudits, the Wolves defence - and Patricio in particular on this occasion - were excellent, allowing their side to keep a fourth clean sheet in five league matches.\nAnd although Cavaleiro probably should have doubled the advantage late on, victory means Wolves are now seventh on 15 points.\n\"We did not start so good but when you look at the whole game we were the better team, the way we controlled the game in the second half,\" Nuno said.\n\"The base of the team was here last season, so everyone knows their tasks. We go game by game - now it is the international break, players can go to their teams, enjoy it and and play some good football. We go game by game - there are no targets.\"\nPalace problems clear\nWith a tough run of fixtures against Everton, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United on the horizon, getting a first home league win was an important aim for Hodgson's side.\nAfter Mamadou Sakho's defensive error cost Palace a point on Monday night against Bournemouth, the Eagles needed a response in front of their home crowd.\nBut since a 2-0 victory over Fulham on the opening day of the season, they have managed just three goals in the subsequent seven league games - two of which have been scored by Zaha, who was silenced for large periods by the Wolves defence.\nPalace created enough opportunities, and both Zaha and Aaron Wan-Bissaka provided trickery, but the team lacked a cutting edge once again as they slipped to 14th in the table.\nJordan Ayew failed to produce in the absence of the injured Christian Benteke and the Eagles now sit four points above the relegation places.\nA lack of success in the final third is becoming a significant worry for the former England manager, with Palace and Huddersfield now the only Premier League sides yet to score a goal after four home games.\n\"Once again I cannot fault players for effort, work-rate and determination - it was a game we were hoping to win but somehow could not do so,\" Hodgson said.\n\"We had enough of the ball, enough determination, but the game's about winning and scoring goals to win and we didn't.\"\nEngland call-up for Coady?\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer on MOTD: \"Conor Coady and Matt Doherty were brilliant\n\"Coady's reading of game was excellent, wanting to play out, very confident with the ball, not panicking. He wanted to stay calm and had a good reading of the game.\n\"He was absolutely magnificent and if he keeps playing like that it will not be long before he gets a full call-up into Gareth Southgate's England squad.\n\"Doherty going forward gives them an option and he scored a beautiful goal, it was a lovely finish.\n\"Wolves do seem very confident in their play.\"\nMan of the match - Matt Doherty (Wolves)\nJimenez and Doherty continue to shine - the stats\nTop flight sides had failed to score in their first four home games of a season only twice before this term, but both Huddersfield and Crystal Palace have managed that this term.\nWolves have won four of their past five top-flight games, as many victories as they managed in their previous 40.\nNuno's side have conceded just one goal in their past seven games in all competitions, after shipping eight in the four before that.\nWing-back Matt Doherty has been directly involved in three goals in his past four league appearances, with one goal and two assists - as many as he managed in his previous 20.\nEach of Wolves' past eight Premier League goals have come in the second half, with just one of their nine overall this season coming before the break.\nRaul Jimenez has been involved in a goal in each of his past four Premier League games for Wolves, assisting in his past three after scoring in the game prior to that.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Wolves host Watford on Saturday, 20 October (15:00 BST) while Crystal Palace travel to face Everton Everton a day later (16:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-2 Newcastle United: Fightback relieves pressure on Mourinho\nManchester United fought back from two down to beat Newcastle and avert a defeat that would have cranked up the pressure on manager Jose Mourinho.\nThe hosts conceded twice in a lacklustre first 10 minutes, with Kenedy and Yoshinori Muto breezing in to score.\nUnited briefly roused themselves with Marcus Rashford heading wide from five yards, but also needed David de Gea's excellence to deny Muto his second and a potentially decisive third for the Magpies.\nThe hosts departed at the break to jeers - some of which were aimed at the club's owner and executives, rather than the manager.\nBut by the final whistle, it was the name of Mourinho that rang around Old Trafford.\nAnalysis - two days bordering on the unbelievable for Mourinho\nI can cope with manhunt - Mourinho\nAll the reaction from Old Trafford\nWhat else happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nThe Portuguese, who brought Alexis Sanchez, Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini off the bench in pursuit of victory, saw his side reenergised after the break, when two of his three substitutes found the net.\nAs Newcastle dropped deeper, Mata swept home a free-kick with 20 minutes left to trigger an onslaught on the visiting goal.\nMartial curled home six minutes later from Paul Pogba's pass and, after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka pawed away Chris Smalling's effort, Sanchez delivered the winner in the last minute of normal time, heading in Ashley Young's cross.\nManchester United's calamitous start\nAccording to one report on Saturday, the club hierarchy had decided before this game to get rid of Mourinho regardless of today's result.\nBBC Sport's understanding is that Mourinho, in fact, still has the support of the club's board.\nTheir faith might have been tested by an astonishing opening.\nAs chief executive Ed Woodward watched on grim-faced in the stands, United's defence crumbled, conceding twice in the initial 10 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time.\nFirst, a lunging Nemanja Matic failed to intercept in midfield before Young tamely allowed Kenedy to turn on to his favoured left foot and fire in.\nThree minutes later, the hosts were either too uncertain or unwilling to close down Jonjo Shelvey, allowing him to sweep into the heart of the box, where Muto easily turned Young and buried Newcastle's second.\nMourinho, who had joked with former Chelsea charge Kenedy in the tunnel and playfully squirted a water bottle at a television camera before kick-off, appeared far less jovial by then.\nAs he gesticulated wildly on the sideline, his players looked at each other in apparent shock.\nMourinho finally finds solution\nMourinho acted quickly in response, sacrificing Eric Bailly, a \u00a330m specialist signing, after just 19 minutes. He installed Scott McTominay, a relatively inexperienced midfielder, in the centre of defence in order to make space for Mata.\nThat reflected a season of confusing decisions and a summer of transfer frustration during which Mourinho made no secret of his desire to sign another centre-back.\nManchester United certainly looked no more solid after the switch as Muto came close to a third and Mohamed Diame strode within striking range unchallenged.\nThe home side were on to their third defensive formation by the start of the second half as Fellaini replaced McTominay. With Mourinho's half-time words apparently having the desired effect, they finally hit on a line-up that worked.\nUnited were more purposeful and urgent, and chased down the game with a determination reminiscent of some of Sir Alex Ferguson's finest days.\nThe glee on the final whistle should be tempered by the strength of the opposition, though.\nNewcastle are without a win in their eight league games this season and, once Mata's goal went in, lost belief and shape. Against tougher opponents, Manchester United may well have found such an escape impossible.\nNewcastle shortcomings exposed\nAfter meeting manager Rafael Benitez and some of the squad at an Italian restaurant on Wednesday in an apparent bridge-building exercise, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was in attendance for his third match in a row.\nThe visitors are in dire need of his interest and, more importantly, his investment.\nTwo points from eight games represents the Magpies' worst start to a top-flight season in the era of three points for a win.\nWith only goal difference keeping them from the bottom of the table, Benitez will surely lobby for more money to spend in January after failing to persuade Ashley to back his judgement in the summer.\nMan of the match - Juan Mata (Manchester United)\n'We promised that we would give everything' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"Marcus Rashford was sad on the pitch, Scott McTominay was scared on the pitch. Even older players commit mistakes that are not normal.\n\"At half-time we had a good conversation. We didn't promise that we would win the match. We promised we would give absolutely everything without any fear, without any pressure, just the pressure of giving everything and of course they gave everything.\n\"We fought so much. They deserve even if the game ends 2-2. The feeling would be a positive feeling because nobody can promise to win matches.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"It is difficult to take because we did so well. At 2-0 we had chances to score the third and we had control against a very good team.\n\"When we conceded the first goal, we started to have problems because they have so many good players that they could bring off the bench, and it is difficult to contain them.\n\"We have to stay calm and be sure we continue working in this way, because we will win games if we play like that.\"\nUnited's magnificent seventh comeback\nManchester United registered their seventh Premier League win after being two or more goals down at half-time - four more than any other team.\nThis is Newcastle's worst-ever start to a top-flight season after eight games in terms of points (2).\nNewcastle are winless in their eight Premier League games this season - only in 1898-99 (first 10) have they gone longer without a win from the start of a top-flight campaign.\nNewcastle have lost eight Premier League matches when scoring first against Manchester United.\nNewcastle found themselves leading for the first time this season in any competition.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2011, Mata has scored more direct free-kick goals in the Premier League than any other player (8).\nPaul Pogba has had a hand in 29 Premier League goals under Mourinho at Manchester United (13 goals, 16 assists), more than any other player.\nSince 2016/17, Manchester United attacker Alexis Sanchez has scored three 90+ minute winners in the Premier League, more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nOnce the international break is over, Manchester United travel to Chelsea on Saturday 20 October (12:30 BST), and Newcastle entertain Brighton on the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-5 Arsenal: Unai Emery's side make it nine consecutive wins\nArsenal manager Unai Emery said Aaron Ramsey is a \"very important player\" for the club after his goal of the season contender helped the Gunners thrash Fulham 5-1.\nA contract offer to Ramsey was withdrawn last month but the Wales midfielder showed his quality when he created and finished a stunning team move to help Arsenal to a ninth straight win in all competitions - their best run since April 2015.\n\"For me it was very important for him to take confidence and take that first goal,\" said Emery.\n\"He did not start in the first 11 today but when he was on he scored within a minute and that gives confidence for both him and us.\n\"We are happy because I think this shows the commitment we have in training and the quality and the understanding of our tactical position.\n\"I think we are in the first competition in the world, and we must keep taking confidence.\"\nAlexandre Lacazette scored two impressive goals before substitute Ramsey added a third and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice.\nFrenchman Lacazette claimed the opening goal of the London derby at Craven Cottage when he spun on Nacho Monreal's cutback before drilling the ball past England's latest goalkeeping addition Marcus Bettinelli.\nBut Fulham drew level before the break as Luciano Vietto pounced on a loose pass by Monreal to thread the ball through to Andre Schurrle, who chipped over Gunners keeper Bernd Leno.\nArsenal regained the lead through Lacazette, after his opportune strike from long range seemed to catch the Fulham keeper by surprise, as it nestled in the bottom corner.\nRamsey was introduced in the 67th minute - and the Welshman added a third just 39 seconds later as Arsenal moved from left to right with one-touch passing and neat headers, before Aubameyang cut the ball back for Ramsey to flick past Bettinelli.\nAubameyang added a fourth when he swivelled on a low cross from Bellerin to side-foot the ball into the far corner, before the Gabon striker rounded off the scoring after a neat low finish to cap a thoroughly entertaining victory in the derby.\nA sixth consecutive Premier League victory for Arsenal moved Unai Emery's men in to fourth in the table, after Chelsea won at Southampton and Manchester City claimed a point at Anfield.\nFulham remain just above the relegation zone in 17th.\nArsenal maintain under-the-radar title push\nAfter losing their opening two Premier League games to Manchester City and Chelsea, Arsenal are showing real signs of progress under Emery.\nAnd the feelgood factor seems to have returned to the club, with chants of \"we've got our Arsenal back\" ringing out from the away end at Craven Cottage.\nThe first half was an even affair but the Gunners showed a clinical edge in the second period to blow their opposition away.\nLacazette and Aubameyang appear to have a great relationship on and off the pitch, and they both scored from the two shots they had on goal on Sunday.\nRamsey and Aubameyang became the first two substitutes to register a goal and an assist in the same game in Premier League history.\nQuestion marks still remain over Arsenal's ability to achieve results against the division's top sides - but Emery is building a team that are making a habit of winning.\nAttack isn't always the best form of defence\nBefore Sunday's game, Fulham striker Aleksander Mitrovic said his side \"needed to be smarter at the back\" but would continue to play the same way and try to score goals.\nFulham are the only Premier League side yet to keep a clean sheet this season, and the Cottagers have also conceded 21 goals - the most in the division.\nBut that does not seem to have deterred Slavisa Jokanovic's men from playing attacking football, as the hosts produced 12 shots on goal in the first half, albeit five of those were blocked and four were off target.\nThe game could have been different as early as three minutes in when Luciano Vietto capitalised on a misplaced pass from Bellerin, but his fierce effort was well saved by Leno, via a Rob Holding deflection.\nBut as the match developed, the visitors' quality began to tell and Fulham's attempt to go toe-to-toe with the Gunners was ruthlessly exploited.\nDefeat by the likes of Arsenal will not determine the Cottagers' season, but Jokanovic may have to tweak his approach against top-quality opposition.\nMan of the match - Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal)\n'We tried to create but showed many weaknesses' - what they said\nFulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic said: \"It is without any doubt a hard defeat for us, we tried to create things but showed many weaknesses as they scored easy goals.\n\"We tried to be offensive and play high with two full-backs to find a solution - but from the second goal it is clear the plan was not working. We really need to work on the weaknesses in the defensive side.\n\"It [conceding goals] has to be a worry always. It is a hard result, but today Arsenal showed their quality and pace. We have 90 [possible] points ahead of us and we need to be brave and keep on fighting.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery said: \"Our performance over the 90 minutes was very important. To be together, and with our performance, we found each moment and each player.\"\nOn Arsenal finding themselves in the top four: \"I believe in us. We believe in our process but also we must keep taking confidence. I think we are in the first competition in the world. It is very difficult but we must prepare, continue improving and show big commitment.\"\nFulham hit record low points haul - the stats\nArsenal have a 51.5% win rate in Premier League London derbies (124 out of 241) - the best in the division. In contrast, Fulham have the lowest win rate in these games (20.7% - 25 out of 121).\nArsenal have won four of their past five away Premier League matches - as many as they had won in their previous 19 on the road.\nThis is Fulham's joint-lowest points haul after the first eight Premier League games in a season.\nArsenal's Alexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in six goals in five starts in the Premier League so far this season (four goals, two assists).\nArsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has had a hand in more goals in all competitions in 2018 than any other player at the club (16 goals, five assists).\nAaron Ramsey scored Arsenal's third goal just 39 seconds after coming on as a substitute - the fastest Premier League goal by an Arsenal substitute since December 2007.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal return to Premier League action after the international break at home to Leicester on Monday, 22 October (20:00 BST), while Fulham travel to Cardiff on Saturday, 20 October (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-3 Chelsea: Ross Barkley praised by Maurizio Sarri\nChelsea head coach Maurizio Sarri expects Ross Barkley to become \"very important for the England national team\" after the midfielder scored and provided an assist in the Blues' win at Southampton.\nBarkley set up Chelsea's opener with a fine pass to Eden Hazard, who finished with aplomb, before netting their second himself, tapping in Olivier Giroud's acrobatic cross.\nIn doing so, Barkley became the first Englishman to score and assist in a Premier League game for Chelsea since Frank Lampard in December 2013.\n\"Today he played really well,\" Sarri said of Barkley. \"I am really happy with him because from the beginning he has improved, day by day, week by week, match by match.\n\"Potentially, he is a great player because he has quality, very important qualities from the physical point of view, from the technical point of view, now he's improving from the tactical point of view.\n\"I think he will become very important in England and for the England national team.\"\nAlvaro Morata scored Chelsea's third deep into injury time, chipping over oncoming home goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, after a slick passing move.\nDefeat for Mark Hughes' side means they remain in 16th, and their run without a win against the Premier League's 'big six' is extended to 26 games.\nMeanwhile, the Blues have now won nine of their 11 games across all competitions this season, and sit second in the Premier League after Liverpool and Manchester City shared a goalless draw.\nHazard and Barkley shine for Blues\nFew believed the Chelsea squad would be able to alter their style of play to match Sarri's expectations when the Italian was appointed in July.\nBut in simple terms, they have flourished. And 'Sarriball' was on show for all to see in the first 15 minutes at St Mary's, as the Blues held 86% of possession.\nAlthough Southampton did grow into the game after that opening spell, in which Willian struck the bar, they could not keep Chelsea at bay for long.\nHazard's finish was typically clinical, but Barkley should also take plaudits for the opener, as it was the former Everton man who dispossessed Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in midfield before playing a perfectly weighted pass to the Belgian.\nThat assist was Barkley's first in the league since April 2017, and 12 minutes into the second half, he notched his first league goal since May 2017 by tapping in Giroud's cross.\nBarkley, who was named in Gareth Southgate's latest England squad on Thursday, was substituted on 81 minutes after a fine afternoon's work, but Chelsea didn't let up and they added a third deep into injury time.\nHazard again was at the heart of it as he slid in Morata, who dinked over McCarthy to score his second in as many games, after netting the winner in Thursday's Europa League clash with Vidi.\nThe international break has perhaps come at a bad time for Sarri and his team, given their form, but nonetheless they will carry plenty of confidence into their next Premier League match against Manchester United on Saturday, 20 October.\nSaints struggles continue\nThis defeat means Southampton have won just one league game at St Mary's in 15 attempts, a run that extends back to November 2017.\nThe returning Manolo Gabbiadini twice tested Kepa Arrizabalaga from range in the first half, though their best chance of the opening 45 minutes fell to Ings.\nThe summer signing from Liverpool has already netted three league goals for the Saints this term, but he was unable to add to that tally after 27 minutes when he volleyed Bertrand's cross over from close range.\nSouthampton did threaten an equaliser following Barkley's goal, and Chelsea had Arrizabalaga to thank for two fine saves in quick succession.\nThe Spaniard first denied Nathan Redmond's rasping effort from range, tipping it onto the bar, before diverting Ings' powerful strike away from goal with a strong right hand.\nHughes' side have now failed to beat a top-half opponent in their last 31 attempts, a run which runs back to April 2017.\nMeanwhile, Hughes' own terrible run against the Blues continues. He has lost a record 19 Premier League games against Chelsea as a manager.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\n'We showed them too much respect' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes told BBC Match of the Day: \"We showed Chelsea too much respect and allowed their players time and space. We needed to get closer, to force them back but we never did that.\n\"We had a chance at 0-0 for Danny Ings, if that goes in we get a different frame of mind. We never got any momentum. Sometimes you have to be brave and we weren't able to do that.\"\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC Match of the Day about his side's title hopes: \"I think the same as I did a week ago. I think Manchester City and Liverpool are a step in front of us so we are working to cover the gap.\"\nChelsea's Eden Hazard on Sky Sports: \"We are enjoying playing well and scoring goals. The first half was not so easy, they missed big chances and then we have had a bit of luck for our first goal, but we controlled the match in the second half.\n\"I don't know if I've played better [than I am at the minute], I'm just playing good football because we are playing good football. I want to keep doing it and keep everyone happy.\"\nCan we play you every week? - the best stats\nChelsea have won their last six Premier League games against Southampton, since losing 3-1 under Jose Mourinho in October 2015.\nThis was the ninth home Premier League game since the start of last season that Southampton have failed to score in - only Huddersfield (12) have failed to score in more home Premier League games in that time.\nEden Hazard has been involved in 11 goals in 15 appearances against Southampton for Chelsea in all competitions (six goals, five assists).\nSince Mark Hughes' first Premier League match in charge of Southampton in March, the Saints have lost nine Premier League games - only Newcastle have lost more (10).\nChelsea's Eden Hazard scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time since October 2016 - which was also at St. Mary's against Southampton.\nIn the last three seasons, Southampton have taken just seven points from their 26 Premier League games against 'big six' opposition (P26 W0 D7 L19).\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Chelsea host Manchester United on Saturday, 20 October (12:30 BST), and Southampton travel to Bournemouth later that day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-0 Man City: Guardiola and Klopp happy after \"intense\" Anfield draw\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola were both left satisfied after a goalless draw left their sides level on points at the top of the Premier League.\nChampions City have not won a league game at Anfield in 15 years, and Riyad Mahrez wasted a glorious opportunity to send them clear when he missed a late penalty.\nCity's \u00a360m summer signing from Leicester fired an 85th-minute spot-kick high over the bar after substitute Leroy Sane was brought down by Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.\nIt handed the Reds a reprieve as both sides extended their unbeaten league starts to eight games, with City now top on goal difference from Chelsea and Liverpool. All three are level on 20 points.\nKlopp said: \"It is a very intense, an unbelievable challenge to face Manchester City always - I've said that before - and as the last game of an intense period, it makes the challenge even bigger, so I am really happy with what the boys did.\n\"We've played City now that often and they're just outstanding.\"\nCity felt they were denied two earlier penalties when Dejan Lovren bundled over Sergio Aguero and Van Dijk handled in an aerial challenge - referee Martin Atkinson waving away the first appeal and awarding a foul for a push by Fernandinho in the second incident.\nMahrez also squandered City's other big chance in a game that failed to live up to expectations, dragging an effort wide, while keeper Ederson was virtually unemployed against Liverpool's normally potent attack.\nGuardiola said: \"We've had 40 or 50 years of not winning here and often we've lost. It's a good result - I'm so satisfied with what we have done.\n\"As a team you know Liverpool will punish our mistakes, and at the back we controlled it very well. So, it would be better to win at Anfield, but we don't lose, last season we lost here, this season we draw, maybe next season we win, we will see.\"\nAnalysis: Why were there no fireworks at Anfield?\nAll the reaction from Anfield\nThrills missing in Anfield stalemate\nThis Anfield confrontation was billed as a potential thrill ride between two sides who - along with Chelsea - have set the pace in the Premier League.\nThe league games last season brought a 5-0 win for City at Etihad Stadium and victory for Liverpool in a 4-3 thriller at Anfield, living up to the demands of Klopp and Guardiola, managers who have assembled teams built for goals.\nIt was not to be - this was a cagey and, at times, dull and tame affair.\nLiverpool's attacking trident of Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were unable to cause the damage they inflicted on City in last season's Champions League quarter-final, while Guardiola's intention was clearly to draw the early fire from Klopp's side.\nCity had no intention of being drawn into the sort of Anfield battles that saw them over-run last season and led to suggestions that Klopp's intense, pressing style was one that Guardiola could not master.\nLiverpool ran out of steam and ideas after the first 10 minutes, while City were content to slow matters down to throw cold water over the Anfield atmosphere - and in that respect it was highly effective as the home side, so irresistible in attack last season, barely troubled Ederson.\nKlopp's side have now gone four games without a win after a flawless start to the season and the influence James Milner has on Liverpool was illustrated by their lack of direction after he went off injured in the first half.\nCity were the better side, but neither was able to produce the decisive moment.\nMixed emotions for Guardiola\nGuardiola will have contrasting feelings at the end of a lacklustre game that only came into life fitfully in the second half.\nThe Spaniard, albeit a manager who always seeks victory, might have just settled for a point before kick-off, but he will be bitterly frustrated at how Mahrez wildly squandered that opportunity to end City's wretched run at Anfield.\nMahrez was hardly the natural choice to take the penalty, having missed three of his past five, and Gabriel Jesus seemed more than willing to step forward. It was an ill-judged decision as he sent his effort well over Alisson's bar and into the Anfield Road Stand.\nCity have lost on three occasions at Anfield under Guardiola so this is, to some extent, a satisfactory result, but the disappointment will come from the knowledge that it could have been even better.\nGuardiola's side have previously been ripped apart on two occasions on this ground, but here they were composed, competitive and kept Liverpool's attack well under control, with John Stones and Aymeric Laporte producing two fine individual performances.\nCity and Guardiola may reflect on an important point later on in the season, but they will also know they had the ideal opportunity to stop a winless sequence at Anfield that now extends to 18 games.\nSalah still searching for golden touch\nSalah was a scourge of Manchester City - and just about everyone else - as he scored 44 goals in a magical first season at Liverpool following his \u00a334m move from Roma.\nHe scored a brilliant, instinctive goal from Ederson's misplaced clearance in Liverpool's league victory at Anfield last season and scored in both legs of their Champions League win against Guardiola's side.\nThe golden touch, for now, has deserted him and this was once again a fruitless 90 minutes for the Egyptian as he strived in vain for the form that illuminated his glorious first campaign.\nSalah cut an increasingly frustrated figure, sending a half-chance tamely into Ederson's arms in the second half and was unable to wreak the sort of havoc that became his trademark last term.\nThe big plus for Liverpool and Salah is that his work-rate never drops and it may just be that one goal, perhaps even a fortunate one, will be the spark to re-ignite him.\nThe Kop have not lost faith, chanting his name and urging him on throughout - and they will be hoping their patience is rewarded.\n'We tried to be ourselves' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"The start of the game was brilliant and we were spot on, unfortunately we couldn't maintain that level. You cannot rest in a game like that, but if there is any chance to rest, it is with the ball.\n\"It looked like a penalty, but the rest of the game was good. If you play City, you have to be 100% spot on and confident. I would say we were 90% spot on after Wednesday but it has come after a tough period.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola:\n\"We competed and we controlled them in terms of the counter attack with their front three.\n\"Our back four was so good and we enjoyed a lot of patient build up, but we didn't create much after that. It's a good result.\n\"We tried to win and we didn't concede at Anfield which is quite special. We had our chance and we tried to be ourselves.\"\nMore penalty pain for Mahrez - the stats\nPep Guardiola has won just one of his past eight managerial meetings with Jurgen Klopp in all competitions (D3, L4), and is winless in the most recent four (D1, L3).\nLiverpool's return of 20 points is their joint-most after eight games of a Premier League campaign, having also done so in 1996-97 and 2008-09.\nWith Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City all yet to suffer a league defeat this term, this is just the second time in Premier League history that as many as three teams have gone unbeaten in their opening eight games of a single season (also 2011-12, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United).\nManchester City had 51% possession at Anfield; their lowest in a Premier League game since Pep Guardiola took charge of the club.\nManchester City striker Sergio Aguero has played 10 matches in all competitions at Anfield in his career (eight with Man City, two with Atletico Madrid), failing to score in any of those games.\nAmong players to have taken at least 10 penalties in the Premier League, only Juan Pablo Angel (50%) has a lower success rate than Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez (58%).\nMan of the match - Bernardo Silva (Manchester City)\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Manchester City return to Premier League action with a home game against Burnley on Saturday, 20 October (15:00 BST).\nOn the same day, Liverpool face a trip to Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium in the evening kick-off (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-2 Man Utd: Jose Mourinho involved in bust-up after Ross Barkley saves Blues\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho was involved in a furious touchline bust-up after Ross Barkley's 96th-minute equaliser rescued Chelsea's unbeaten Premier League start at Stamford Bridge.\nMourinho's side looked on course for an outstanding win over his former club after two goals from Anthony Martial overturned the first-half lead given to the hosts by Antonio Rudiger's 21st-minute header.\nHe bowed his head in disappointment as Barkley scored in the dying seconds after a goalmouth scramble, but then reacted angrily as Chelsea technical assistant Marco Ianni celebrated in front of him before then pumping his fists in Mourinho's direction again.\nThe Portuguese jumped from his seat and was then held back by a mixture of stewards and Manchester United staff as he attempted to get down the tunnel at Ianni.\nIt was a dramatic conclusion as Mourinho saw victory snatched away after he had replied to the taunts of Chelsea fans by holding up three fingers to remind them of the three Premier League titles he won while in charge at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Blues looked in control when Rudiger took advantage of Paul Pogba's poor marking to head home Willian's corner, but United responded superbly after the break and Martial's double - a smart, swivelling finish and a composed, low effort - put the visitors on the brink of three points until that frantic finale.\nHow the game unfolded at Stamford Bridge\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nMourinho's emotions boil over\nMourinho kept his emotions in check for most of the afternoon as returned again to the club where enjoyed success still under pressure at Manchester United - but then it all boiled over in that super-charged finish.\nHe allowed himself a celebratory fist-pump when Martial drove in United's second goal. It was low-key and would have gone pretty much unnoticed had it not been caught on the television cameras.\nIt was then, as the clock ticked down, that Mourinho's body language became animated and his emotions bubbled to the surface, concluding in that chaotic confrontation by the tunnel entrance as he felt Chelsea technical staff member Ianni overdid the celebrations of Barkley's late leveller.\nThe manager's temperature was rising even before then as United protected the lead that could have given them a crucial win, with the added delight for Mourinho of achieving it at Stamford Bridge, where he won those three titles. No matter how calm he tried to remain, you could see how much this meant to him.\nWhen goalscorer Martial chased back towards the halfway line to close down a Chelsea player, Mourinho was jumping out of his seat in the technical area - first to urge the France forward on to greater efforts to win the ball, then with an extravagant fist-pump, applause and even an advance onto the pitch to slap him on the back for completing his task.\nMourinho's understandable anguish as Barkley celebrated his equaliser was not helped by what he clearly saw as gloating from the Chelsea backroom member, and he was only persuaded to let the matter rest after being calmed down by stewards and his staff.\nThe Portuguese decided to have the last word with that three-fingered gesture towards Chelsea fans - but victory would have been a much sweeter response.\nMartial delivers for Mourinho\nMartial has often cut a discontended figure at Manchester United this season - and his relationship with Mourinho has been the subject of much debate.\nThe 22-year-old France forward has been marginalised on occasions this season, but has now proved his worth and quality in successive games.\nMartial's snapshot finish played its part in the comeback from two goals down to beat Newcastle United before the international break, and on Saturday at Stamford Bridge he was the spearhead for United's revival after Chelsea controlled the first half.\nHe equalised with a finish of superb technique on the turn, then coolly completed good work by Juan Mata and Marcus Rashford by steering a low shot into the bottom corner.\nMartial was also willing to do the dirty work and was rewarded with a warm embrace and words from his manager that brought a smile to his face when he was substituted.\nUnited's hierarchy clearly see Martial as a key element of their future and hope he will commit to a long-term contract. Mourinho will certainly be grateful for his contribution in the past two games.\nChelsea show fighting spirit\nChelsea's wild celebrations after Barkley scrambled home their equaliser demonstrated the importance of keeping their unbeaten league start going against one of their close rivals.\nMaurizio Sarri's side had been the victim of Daniel Sturridge's late equaliser when Liverpool took a point here - but were grateful for something similar of their own this time, with Barkley on hand to smash home after David Luiz's header hit a post and David de Gea saved brilliantly from Rudiger.\nChelsea boss Sarri will surely be concerned about how his side lost the control they enjoyed in the first half, when they were untroubled by United, but he must be delighted they were still battling and pushing so deep into six minutes of stoppage time to rescue what could be an important point.\nThe Blues have shown they are willing to scrap as well as turn on the style - and it was enough to ensure they are yet to suffer a league loss this season.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial (Manchester United)\n'We were in the wrong' - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri to BBC Sport: \"We have played very well in the first hour but then we have played the match of United - a physical match, and United are better than us in a physical match. I am disappointed with the last 30 minutes. We could win but at the end one point is enough.\n\"We were not organised for the long ball, we usually play with short passes so we were not organised for this in the last half hour. This is not our football. I prefer to play our football for 90 minutes.\n\"I didn't see what happened but I have spoken to Jose Mourinho. I understood that we were on the wrong side of the situation. I have spoken to a member of my staff and have dealt with this immediately.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho to BBC Sport: \"A fantastic match, a very undeserved result for us but that is football. We were the best team, even in the first half when we were losing.\n\"We were in control, tactically - the result is really unfair for us. We conceded from two set-pieces, but that is a way to score goals and you have to be able to defend against that.\n\"Anthony Martial is improving, he is doing different things than before. He is a more complete player than before - but he needs to improve. He has a huge talent and he wants it, which is a good thing. The team as a team was really good.\"\nTell us about your reaction at the end...\n\"It is not my reaction, it is Sarri's assistant. He was very impolite but Sarri took care of the situation. They have both apologised to me. I accept. For me, the story is over.\n\"Don't do what everyone does and say: 'It's Mourinho who does things.' I don't know his name, I don't need to know. Everything is fine.\"\nFortress Stamford Bridge - the stats\nChelsea have lost just one of their past 17 home Premier League games against Manchester United, a 3-2 defeat in October 2012.\nThe Blues are unbeaten in their past 65 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge in which they have been ahead at half-time, winning 54 of those. They last lost 5-3 against Arsenal in October 2011.\nRoss Barkley's goal was the latest Manchester United have conceded in the league since October 2009.\nBarkley has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2015, when he played for Everton.\nAnthony Martial has scored more goals for Manchester United than any other player (40) since he arrived at the club in September 2015.\nMartial scored twice in a competitive game for United for the first time since November 2016 against West Ham.\nManchester United have kept just one clean sheet in their nine Premier League games this season, after having had seven by this stage last season.\nAll three of Antonio Rudiger's Premier League goals for Chelsea have come at Stamford Bridge.\nWhat's next\nChelsea host Bate Borisov in the Europa League on Thursday (kick-off 20:00 BST), before returning to Premier League action at Burnley on Sunday, 28 October (13:30 GMT).\nManchester United welcome Juventus to Old Trafford in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 BST), and then host Everton in the league next Sunday (16:00 GMT)."

But against Brighton, who came to the North East winless in 17 away league games, that cutting edge that almost saw off Manchester United was missing once more.\nAfter going behind in the 29th minute, they continually pressed the visiting backline. But many of their efforts on target barely troubled Ryan, who was only really tested by Shelvey.\nScottish midfielder Matt Ritchie, with a header that flew narrowly wide, and Yoshinori Muto, nodding over a difficult chance, were the only other efforts of note from Newcastle.\nAn away trip to Southampton is next for the Magpies.\nBrighton make the most of few chances\nThe mini-jinx is over. After four failed attempts, Hughton has finally won at St James' Park as a former manager thanks to a brilliant defensive display, led by Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk, and Kayal's first-half strike.\nThe loss of Murray early in the match took the bite out of his side's attack, but they were less profligate than their opponents in front of goal and scored with the one shot on target from their seven efforts.\nKayal's name is on the scoresheet, but much of the credit for the goal goes to Colombian jack-in-the-box Izquierdo, whose shot from a corner took a slight deflection off the Israel international and beat keeper Martin Dubravka.\nThe Seagulls almost added another in the closing minutes, but substitute Yves Bissouma fired a foot wide after racing clear of the Newcastle defence.\nHe might be asked to do extra shooting practice in training, while his defence deserve an extra day off.\nMan of the match - Shane Duffy (Brighton)\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Southampton next Saturday, still looking for their first league win of the season, while Brighton host Wolves (both 15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-2 Watford: Capoue and Pereyra seal Hornets win\nTwo goals in 58 first-half seconds saw a dominant Watford seal their first win since September and end Wolves' six-game unbeaten run.\nA rocket shot from Etienne Capoue opened the scoring for the Hornets following a tentative start at Molineux, before a slick finish from Roberto Pereyra doubled their lead moments later.\nIt was a minute that knocked the wind out of the Wolves players' sails on what proved to be a frustrating afternoon for the hosts, who were fielding an unchanged starting line-up for the ninth successive game.\nThe defeat was their first at home this season, while Watford ended a five-game winless streak.\nLittle could separate the sides in a drab opening 20 minutes before Capoue scored his second goal of the season, receiving the ball outside the area from Abdoulaye Doucoure and sending it flying through the legs of Wolves captain Conor Coady and past helpless keeper Rui Patricio.\nMost Watford fans had yet to sit back down before their side went two ahead, Pereyra delightfully dinking the ball over Patricio with the outside of his left boot.\nWolves found another gear in the second half but were left exasperated as they struggled to convert their chances, with late efforts from Helder Costa and substitute Ivan Cavaleiro going begging.\nWhat else happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nHow the action unfolded at Molineux\nTurning point for Watford?\nJavi Gracia was forced to make big changes to his line-up. Both Christian Kabasele and Jose Holebas were missing through suspension, while striker Troy Deeney was ruled out with a minor hamstring injury.\nBut his changes paid dividends as Watford found the form they had been lacking in recent weeks, after winning their first four games of the campaign.\nThey blew Wolves away with their rapid double and could have had a couple more but for the hosts' resolute defenders, who refused to be embarrassed having conceded just once in their previous seven games.\nShortly after the goals, Gerard Deulofeu had a chance to make it three when Isaac Success was brought down by Willy Boly just inches outside the penalty box, but his free-kick hit the wall.\nWolves had no answer as their visitors continued to dominate the first half, and Pereyra almost had his second seven minutes before the break but curled his effort over the bar.\nVictory marked Watford's 50th Premier League win and lifted them above Wolves to seventh in the table.\nFrustration for Wolves\nSo impressive has Wolves' start to the season been that manager Nuno Espirito Santo had named the same starting line-up for nine successive games, but Watford proved their undoing as they lost for the first time at Molineux since January and failed to find the assured level fans have become used to seeing in the first half.\nHowever, a different side came out after the break and threatened Watford early in the second half, substitute Ruben Vinagre seeing his cross spilled by Ben Foster before another cross from Helder Costa just floated too high for Diogo Jota in the box.\nA much sharper performance meant the Hornets were prevented the time and space they had enjoyed in the first half - but they failed to trouble Foster, who saved a cheeky backheeled effort from Boly on the hour mark.\nThe home supporters were incensed when Vinagre was pulled up by referee Lee Mason when through on goal after he had judged the defender to have pulled down Adrian Mariappa - and the boos continued when a penalty appeal was waved away following a tackle on Costa by Will Hughes.\nWolves piled the pressure on in the dying minutes but their afternoon was summed up when Cavaleiro sent a free header over the bar.\nMan of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford)\n'The first half was amazing' - what they said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We played a good game. The first half was amazing, and with two goals we managed the game until the end.\n\"The two goals in a short time were key. After that we managed the situation well. Wolves played better at the start of the second half, but we took control again and defended well.\n\"We wanted to offer a good version of us, a good face and try to offer this win to our supporters. Today is a reward for them as well.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We didn't play well, particularly in first half. When you don't perform well you cannot achieve a result.\n\"That minute with the goals, we must look at carefully. Two mistakes, two goals. In the second half we had a better attitude. Even if you lose you must lose with dignity and we tried until the end.\"\nThe stats\nThis was Wolves' first defeat in 15 games at Molineux, since losing to Nottingham Forest in the Championship in January.\nWatford have won two of their past four away games in the Premier League, more than they had in their previous 16 games (W1 D2 L13).\nWolves have named the same starting XI for their opening nine games of the season, extending that Premier League record.\nThey are the first Premier League team to name the same starting XI nine times in a row since Burnley in February 2015.\nThere were just 58 seconds between Watford's first and second goals against Wolves - both were assisted by Abdoulaye Doucoure.\nRoberto Pereyra's goal was his first away league goal for Watford since scoring against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October 2017 - each of his previous seven goals had been at Vicarage Road.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Brighton in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 BST kick-off), while Watford host Huddersfield at the same time."

        "article_text": "Cardiff City 4-2 Fulham: Bluebirds move off bottom with first win of season\nFulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic said his side have \"so many defensive problems to fix\" after they slipped into the Premier League relegation zone with defeat at Cardiff.\nAndre Schurrle's spectacular 30-yard strike put the visitors ahead against the run of play, but within 10 minutes they trailed against a resurgent Bluebirds side inspired by a fervent home crowd.\nJosh Murphy equalised with a precise low finish, then Bobby Reid seized on frenetic Fulham defending to slot in his first goal for the club - only for Ryan Sessegnon to make it 2-2 before the break.\nFulham seemed to grow in confidence from that point, but Cardiff responded again, with Callum Paterson shooting on the turn to squeeze the ball into the bottom corner to make it 3-2.\nThen, as the visitors went in search of a late equaliser, a slip from Tim Ream allowed Victor Camarasa to square the ball to Cardiff substitute Kadeem Harris, whose close-range finish prompted delirious celebrations among the home fans.\nCardiff's season starts here - Warnock\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nThe best Premier League stats\nCardiff's first league win of the season lifted them off the bottom of the table and out of the relegation zone, while Fulham have now conceded 12 goals in their past three games.\n\"We must find a solution to stop this kind of situation, fix our mistakes and concede fewer goals,\" said Jokanovic.\n\"We are definitely not doing enough good work in our box. Even when we defend with four or five centre-backs, we didn't find the solution.\"\nCardiff finally taste victory\nEven manager Neil Warnock said on Friday he would not bet on Cardiff surviving this season - although, having then pointed out the odds were also against them winning promotion from the Championship last term, one got the impression the remark was tongue in cheek.\nIt was not without sincerity, though. After all, Cardiff had not won at home in the Premier League since beating Fulham here in March 2014.\nThere was hope for the hosts in the fact their opponents were the only team in the division yet to keep a clean sheet this season.\nIt was clear to see why that was the case. Either side of Schurrle's spectacular opener, Cardiff created chances with a frequency they had not enjoyed since they were in the Championship.\nMurphy was their most potent threat, tormenting Calum Chambers to such an extent that the Fulham right-back was substituted at half-time.\nFittingly, it was Murphy who scored the equaliser, cushioning a brilliant long ball from Sol Bamba and advancing into the penalty area before firing into the bottom corner.\nCardiff's second owed more to luck, with Fulham unable to clear a free-kick and Aron Gunnarsson's block falling kindly to Reid, who threaded the ball between Marcus Bettinelli's legs.\nWorryingly for the home side, however, they could not make this period of dominance count and still found themselves pegged back by Sessegnon's equaliser.\nThe sense of frustration was palpable, and so was the relief when Paterson swivelled smartly in the penalty area to guide his low, slow shot into the net.\nIf the celebrations after that goal were loud, the noise that greeted Harris' late fourth was deafening, as Cardiff's supporters dared to dream their team could yet again confound the odds this season.\nSaturday's Premier League reaction\nAll the action as it happened at Cardiff City Stadium\nFulham's leaky defence proves costly again\nGoing into this game, Slavisa Jokanovic's side were without a victory since August, and their biggest concerns were defensive - having conceded eight goals in their previous two matches. Those worries worsened here.\nFulham were rattled by their opponents' purposeful start, and were disorganised and panicky under pressure.\nBut once Sessegnon drew them level - running on to Aleksandar Mitrovic's neat flick to finish with similar style - the visitors settled.\nThey kept possession and played with more composure in the second half, keeping Cardiff's direct attacks at bay for long periods.\nOnce again, however, their defensive frailties were exposed as Paterson restored the hosts' lead.\nFulham had chances to snatch a point, the best of which fell to former Swansea City centre-back Alfie Mawson, whose late header was superbly saved by Neil Etheridge. But a draw would have been a lucky escape for Fulham.\nIn the 87th minute there was a moment that crystallised their collective defensive effort, when Ream slipped near the halfway line, allowing Camarasa to run clear and set up Harris for Cardiff's fourth goal.\nMan of the match - Josh Murphy (Cardiff)\n'I can enjoy my weekend now' - what they said\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock: \"It's just a great feeling for everyone at the club. We have been playing well the last few weeks and not had the rub of the green. We persevered and they didn't let the disappointments get them down.\n\"We are made of stern stuff, the fans are unbelievable as well. In the second half we rolled our sleeves up and said, 'This is our season'.\n\"We wanted to have a go at them and we did. Everyone worked to the plan and on another day we could have got more, but I can't be too greedy. I can enjoy my weekend now.\"\nFulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic: \"We are frustrated after this kind of defeat. We weren't strong enough in our box. They scored easy goals, even when we defend in numbers they finish the action and score.\n\"We have so many problems in the defensive side but we have to find a solution. It's still early on in the competition. We can find improvement, we must be brave and keep going to fix our mistakes.\"\nCardiff are back in the goals - the stats\nCardiff have scored four or more goals in a top-flight game for the first time since September 1961 vs Chelsea (5-2).\nFulham's Ryan Sessegnon is the first player born in or after the year 2000 to score a Premier League goal. Sessegnon is also Fulham's youngest ever goalscorer in the Premier League (18 years 154 days).\nCardiff have won their first Premier League game since April 2014 (vs Southampton), ending a run of 12 matches without a victory.\nFulham have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 23 Premier League away games - the longest such run since QPR between October 2011 and November 2012 (also 23 games).\nCardiff's Josh Murphy scored in consecutive home league appearances for the first time in his career.\nFulham's Andre Schurrle has scored 73% of his Premier League goals in away games (11 of 15).\nWhat's next?\nCardiff face a daunting trip to Anfield to face Liverpool next Saturday, 27 October (15:00 BST), while Fulham take on Bournemouth at Craven Cottage on the same day."

I am very proud about the team. We must continue like this but nobody is happy with the result.\"\nWest Ham's Andriy Yarmolenko was carried off on a stretcher with an ankle injury in the first half, while Javier Hernandez had a goal ruled out for offside in the closing stages.\nTottenham have now won nine of their past 11 league games and sit fourth in the table, while Manuel Pellegrini's side remain 15th after back-to-back defeats.\nLamela and Lloris the difference for Spurs\nA 3-0 win at Manchester United in August aside, Tottenham's title challenge has gone largely under the radar despite Pochettino's side equalling their best start to a Premier League season with victory over Cardiff before the international break.\nBut the lethargic nature of that 1-0 win prompted Pochettino to demand they \"improve a lot\" if they are to challenge for the top honour.\nSpurs - now level on points with third-placed Chelsea - did find a way to win once again - but only just - to record successive away wins over West Ham for the first time since August 2009.\nThe visitors had Lloris to thank on several occasions as West Ham grew in confidence.\nLamela took his opportunity to impress on a rare start, and linked up well with Lucas Moura and Harry Kane going forward, although it was another afternoon of limited opportunities for the England captain.\nThe majority of chances Kane and Spurs did create were blocked by West Ham bodies, and the Hammers were often allowed time to get men behind the ball when Spurs threatened.\nThis was the first of seven games in only 22 days for Tottenham, who face a likely must-win Champions League tie against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday.\nHammers recovery put on hold\nA 1-0 defeat by Brighton before the international break ended a four-game unbeaten run for West Ham, who had begun to turn around a miserable start to Pellegrini's tenure.\nBut, seeking successive home wins for the first time in almost two years, they hosts failed to start with the same purpose that blew Manchester United away in their previous home fixture.\nArnautovic was deemed fit to start and proved the main goal threat for West Ham as summer signing Yarmolenko was replaced after 40 minutes and fellow forward Felipe Anderson failed to make an impact.\nThe hosts recorded 13 shots - 10 of which came in the second half - to Tottenham's 10, and would have taken at least a point had it not been for Lloris, who was equal to everything Arnautovic sent his way.\nEncouraged by Spurs' inability to add a second goal, the Hammers launched an assault on the Tottenham penalty area in the closing stages which culminated in Michail Antonio firing a powerful effort over from the edge of the area.\nAlthough largely comfortable at the back, West Ham were unable to find a breakthrough for the second game running.\nMan of the match - Hugo Lloris (Tottenham)\nLamela in fine form - the stats\nSpurs have won nine of their past 12 away league games, including five of six on the road this season.\nErik Lamela has scored five goals in eight games in all competitions for Spurs this season, one more than he managed in 33 games last season.\nLamela has been directly involved in 10 goals in his past nine games for Spurs (seven goals, three assists).\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini has lost consecutive Premier League games without his sides scoring a goal for the first time.\nWest Ham are without a win in eight Premier League London derbies since beating Chelsea in December 2017.\nTottenham have won five consecutive top-flight London derbies for the first time since January 1961 - when they won the First Division.\nWest Ham's return of seven points from their opening nine games of the season is their worst return at this stage since 2010-11 when they finished bottom.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham are away to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday (17:55 BST), before hosting Premier League leaders Manchester City on Monday, 29 October (20:00 GMT).\nWest Ham face Leicester City at the King Power Stadium next Saturday (17:30)."

The goals were so outstanding - beautiful, beautiful goals - and the chances we created, and it's three more points.\"\nGuardiola's side were briefly knocked off the summit by Chelsea's draw with Manchester United earlier on Saturday, but opened up a two-point lead before Liverpool moved level on points with a 1-0 win at Huddersfield in the late kick-off.\nCity's procession towards the three points was initially held up by Clarets keeper Joe Hart, making his first return to Etihad Stadium after ending his 12-year stay in the summer.\nHart, a huge crowd favourite during his spell at the club, made superb first-half stops to deny Sergio Aguero and David Silva, but was powerless to stop Aguero firing home as the duo combined to round off a neat passing move. Hart's afternoon was to get a lot worse.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nThe best Premier League stats\nReaction to Saturday's games\nBurnley barely threatened before half-time but their hopes were only truly extinguished when City added two more goals in two minutes shortly before the hour mark.\nThere was some controversy about City's second goal, which came after Leroy Sane went down in the area under a challenge by Jack Cork.\nReferee Jon Moss waved play on but the Burnley defence stopped, allowing Silva to retrieve the ball before it ran out of play and cross for Silva to sweep home.\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche and his players continued to protest as the game resumed, although it was unclear whether they felt the game had been stopped, or that the ball had gone behind before Silva reached it.\nIt clearly played on the Clarets' minds, however, and their usual defensive organisation was nowhere to be seen when, seconds later, a corner was cleared as far as Fernandinho on the edge of the area and he found a sublime finish.\nFrom that point, the game was over as a contest, although the City fans still had more reasons to celebrate, firstly when a fit-again Kevin de Bruyne appeared off the bench for his first appearance since the opening weekend of the season.\nThere were more goals to come as Fernandinho teed up Riyad Mahrez to curl home a superb fourth goal late on, and Sane converted a Benjamin Mendy cross.\nHart makes unhappy return\nHart, 31, had to contend with Cardiff fans chanting \"England's number four\" at him during Burnley's last away game, but got a much warmer reception on his return to his former home.\nEven Guardiola, who loaned him out for two seasons before selling him last summer, wrote some affectionate words about the England international in his programme notes.\nHart, who won every major domestic honour during his time at City, was given a standing ovation by the home fans before the game, but the occasion will not be remembered for his fine saves to keep out Aguero's acrobatic volley or Silva's close-range header.\nHart would have been hoping for a clean sheet that became his trademark during his time at City - he managed 82 on home turf alone.\nInstead, on his 180th appearance here, and his first as an opposition player, he conceded five goals at Etihad Stadium for the first time.\n\"There is a feeling of frustration in my chest right now,\" Hart said. \"The crowd reaction was nice but I came here as a Burnley player. It was far from a perfect day.\"\nHowever, there was little he could do about any of the goals, with Burnley's usually solid defence looking particularly brittle in the second half, and collapsing completely by the end.\nDyche lists Burnley grievances\nBurnley did not manage a single shot on target and Dyche accepted his side were well beaten, but felt big decisions went against them at \"key moments\" of the game.\nThat started in the very first minute, when Vincent Kompany's reckless challenge on Burnley winger Aaron Lennon saw the City captain booked.\nDyche said: \"Kompany is out of control and he does not know where the man is, or the ball. It is just a throw of the leg and it is high - Aaron has got a cut with two stitches in it, high in his thigh.\n\"It is not vicious or anything but there is no control in the challenge and we are told that is a big thing in challenges like that, so in the modern game that is a red card.\"\nWhile Dyche felt his players were at fault for switching off for City's second goal, he was adamant it should not have stood, with Hart also saying the assistant referee apologised to him later.\nDyche said: \"Sane goes down with the tiniest of touches and the referee is going to blow his whistle, but then decides not to and waves it away.\n\"In the meantime a player who is off the pitch has walked back on the pitch to go and get the ball that is off the pitch to deliver a cross that they then score from. If that is not confusing for everyone in the stadium, it is certainly confusing for me.\n\"I thought it at the time, and I have seen it back since. With the best view that we can get of it, the ball is out of play, so you can forget about everything else.\"\nDyche also felt Sane should have been sent off late on for a challenge on Matt Lowton.\n\"With Sane right at the end, it has got to be a red card,\" Dyche added. \"He kicked Matt for no reason at all, just smashing him around his legs. It has got to be a red card, as simple as that.\"\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Manchester City)\nFive goals again for City - the stats\nManchester City are now unbeaten in their past 34 Premier League games kicking off at 3pm on a Saturday - the longest such run in the competition (W30 D4).\nThis was City's 23rd Premier League victory by a margin of five goals or more - 10 of them have been under manager Pep Guardiola.\nThis was just Burnley's fourth Premier League defeat by five or more goals - half of them have been against City.\nThere were only 115 seconds between City's second and third goals.\nCity's David Silva provided more than one assist in a Premier League game for the 12th time. Only Ryan Giggs (17), Cesc Fabregas (17) and Thierry Henry (13) have done so in more.\nCity's Sergio Aguero has scored seven goals in seven games in all competitions against Burnley, including in all four appearances against them at the Etihad.\nSilva has assisted Sergio Aguero more than any other City player in all competitions (20).\nCity's Fernandinho scored and assisted in a Premier League game for only the second time, also doing so against West Brom in October 2017.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to Ukraine to face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 BST).\nCity face Tottenham at Wembley on Monday 29 October (20:00 GMT), while Burnley welcome Chelsea to Stamford Bridge on Sunday, 28 October (13:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 0-1 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah's strike earns narrow win\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he is \"winning average games\" for the first time in his life after Mohamed Salah sealed a narrow victory at Huddersfield that keeps them level on points with Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nSalah's 50th goal in English football came courtesy of a smart low finish, as he put away Xherdan Shaqiri's 24th-minute through ball to dampen a mood matching Huddersfield's bright start.\nEgypt forward Salah was visibly buoyed, having failed to score in his previous four appearances, but Huddersfield reacted positively as they twice went close to equalising before half-time.\nCaptain Jonathan Hogg smashed a long-range drive against the post before Alex Pritchard was marginally offside when lifting a finish past Alisson, while a penalty appeal for handball against James Milner was turned down.\nAfter the break, Laurent Depoitre saw a header well held with Huddersfield's only attempt on target, while Salah fired wide when presented with a tough chance to finish at speed on the counter-attack.\nThere was a league debut for the Reds' \u00a339m former Monaco midfielder Fabinho but, even with his introduction, Liverpool failed to totally assume control of a game that Huddersfield substitute Steve Mounie almost snatched away from them.\nWith eight minutes to play, the Benin striker rashly blazed over from inside the box after a cross spilled through unconvincing blocks from Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren.\n\"It is the first period in my life that we can win average matches,\" Klopp said. \"I prefer the spectacular way, but I would take that today completely.\n\"When you come back from the international break there are many things no-one asks about, like the time difference.\n\"That is why I was a bit more animated on the touchline today because if you are tired, you at least need to be afraid of your manager.\"\nVictory lifted Liverpool into second in the table. They trail Pep Guardiola's side on goal difference, with the defending champions 10 goals better off after a 5-0 win over Burnley earlier on Saturday.\nHuddersfield, who last season defied the odds to avoid relegation, remain without a victory this term and are now two points from safety in 19th.\nRelive Huddersfield v Liverpool\nOne touch is enough - just\nThis was not a vintage performance from a Liverpool side who many recognise as the most likely challengers to City, but, having drawn away to Chelsea and at home to the defending champions in their previous two league games, getting three points was what mattered most.\nWithout regulars Sadio Mane and Naby Keita - both were injured over the international break - at times the link-up play between midfield an attack was flat, and there were plenty of errors in possession.\nIn fact, Liverpool made the most failed passes they have all season - 111 - a statistic which also helps reflect Huddersfield's combative display.\nDavid Wagner's side often forced errors, but they were lacking in quality when chances presented themselves. The same was not true of the Reds in the one moment that ultimately mattered.\nSalah's goal, tucked home first-time from Shaqiri's clever pass, decided the contest, as this Liverpool team became the first in the club's history to concede as few as three goals in the opening nine matches of a league campaign.\nThe dry run goes on\nHuddersfield are now without victory in 13 league games, having drawn five and lost eight since a 1-0 victory at home to Watford on 14 April.\nIn failing to score once more, they equalled a top-flight record by going five consecutive home fixtures from the beginning of a season without a goal.\nMight things have turned out differently? Had Hogg's blistering strike found net instead of post, they may well have grown further and capitalised against a side that looked vulnerable despite their lead.\nIn the end, Depoitre's 55th-minute header was comfortably saved by Alisson. Mounie appeared to lose his head when presented with a golden chance to equalise late on.\nOnly Huddersfield and bottom club Newcastle have failed to win since August's opening day, and neither can rely on the poor form of those around them any longer.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nSalah's landmark total - the stats\nHuddersfield have failed to score in their past seven home Premier League games, since Tom Ince netted in a 1-0 victory over Watford in April. Only Manchester City (eight in 2006-07) have ever had a longer such run in the competition\nHuddersfield have become just the second side in Premier League history to fail to score in any of their opening five home games of a season after Everton in 1998-99\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in three goals in three Premier League outings against Huddersfield (two goals and one assist)\nSalah's opener for Liverpool was his 50th goal for English sides (48 Liverpool, 2 Chelsea), reaching this tally in just 83 games in all competitions\nLiverpool's Alisson has kept six clean sheets in his opening nine Premier League starts - the only goalkeeper to have kept more in his opening nine starts in the competition is Petr Cech (seven)\nWhat the managers said\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"This handball situation was a huge situation and I don't understand why it wasn't a penalty. I haven't spoken to the referee.\n\"It was a clear handball and the ball changed direction because of this handball and Laurent Depoitre couldn't receive the ball. It is handball. That could easily decide the direction of the match.\n\"But apart from this we limited them and they're a top class team. We were with them and we can take this forward with us.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The basis we have created so far is brilliant - 23 points. I don't think I've had that after nine games. And there is still space for improvement, which is good as well, so let's get home and work on improving.\n\"Huddersfield did well. They defended well and were very aggressive around the second balls. After this game, everybody knows how good they are and how good they will be in the future.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool next play in the Champions League, at home to Serbian champions Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday. Next Saturday they play at home to Cardiff in the Premier League.\nHuddersfield travel to Watford in the Premier League next Saturday."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-0 Crystal Palace: Hosts score twice in last three minutes\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson said it was \"hard to stand here as a loser again\" after Everton scored twice in the last three minutes to snatch a dramatic Premier League victory.\nTactical changes by Toffees boss Marco Silva decided the game, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin heading in fellow substitute Ademola Lookman's cross.\nMoments later a third substitute, Cenk Tosun, hit the winner at Goodison Park.\n\"Had we won or drawn no-one would have begrudged us that,\" Hodgson said.\nEarlier in the second half, Everton keeper Jordan Pickford saved Luka Milivojevic's penalty with his feet.\nEverton's third victory in a row lifted them to eighth in the table, while Palace stay 15th, two points above the relegation zone with only two wins this season.\nHodgson's team, who have only scored five goals this term, face a tough run of fixtures over the next month, starting with next Sunday's home game against fifth-placed Arsenal.\nPalace then go to Chelsea the following weekend and host Tottenham on 10 November, before returning after the international break with a trip to Manchester United.\n\"Football does not give you what you deserve, it is a question of results. All you can do is hope the team played well enough to get a result,\" Hodgson said.\n\"Every game in the Premier League is a tough assignment. Obviously the top teams have very good quality players and have more resources than some of teams we play against.\n\"But the bottom line is have to play all the teams in the league. Everton have qualities and we were prepared to try and nullify them. We will do same against Arsenal.\"\nSilva strikes gold with substitutes\nFor most of the afternoon a rather drab encounter looked destined to finish goalless as both sides struggled to create clear chances.\nWhat swung the game in Everton's favour was Silva's decision to make a bold attacking double change, bringing on forwards Calvert-Lewin and Lookman with eight minutes left.\nThe home side effectively switched to a 4-2-4 formation, having earlier introduced striker Tosun for attacking midfielder Bernard.\nLookman clipped in a precise, curling ball from the left which was met by a Calvert-Lewin header from close range.\nAs Palace belatedly tried to respond, Tosun latched on to a long punt clear by defender Michael Keane to fire through Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey's legs one minute 44 seconds later.\n\"It came down to which manager was brave enough to make the big changes - and it was Marco Silva,\" former Scotland winger Pat Nevin said on BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"Luck favoured the brave. I don't think you will see too many better substitutions this season.\"\nThis was the first time since August 2017 that three substitutes were directly involved in goals in a Premier League game.\n\"We, the staff, are here to make decisions, it is not just the starting 11,\" Silva said.\n\"The three players who came on were aggressive, it is really good and I'm very happy for them.\"\nPickford lets his feet do the talking... again\nEngland international Pickford, 24, attracted plaudits during the international break after his distribution helped set up two goals in the surprise 3-2 Nations League win over Spain on Monday.\nAgain he produced a moment of quality with his feet, albeit in a rather different manner after Seamus Coleman tripped Wilfried Zaha to concede the penalty.\nDiving to his left, Pickford stuck out his right boot to stop Milivojevic's spot-kick down the middle and prevent Palace from taking the lead with only their second shot on target.\nIt was only Milivojevic's second penalty miss in his past 11 attempts.\n\"It was a good save from the goalkeeper,\" Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson said. \"If Luka had scored it might have been a different story.\"\nWickham returns after two-year absence\nOne positive for Palace was the return of striker Connor Wickham after a two-year absence because of a serious knee injury and subsequent problems.\nThe 25-year-old made his first appearance since November 2016 when he came him on seconds after Tosun's 89th-minute goal, but had little time to make an impact.\n\"He has worked so very hard to get into that position where he is deemed fit enough to get on the bench,\" Hodgson said.\n\"We would not have risked him for a long period of the game. I'm sure he will be pleased to have got on the field for Palace in a Premier League game and hopefully it will give him hope and heart.\n\"He has still got a lot of hard work to do on the training field.\"\nMan of the match - Jordan Pickford (Everton)\nHodgson must hate going to Goodison - the stats\nEverton have won three straight Premier League matches for the first time since January 2017\nCrystal Palace are now without a win in four league matches, drawing one and losing three\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson has not won on his past eight Premier League visits to Goodison Park, losing seven and drawing one\nEverton have scored more headed goals in the Premier League this season than any other side\nDominic Calvert-Lewin and Cenk Tosun are the first two Everton substitutes to score in the same Premier League game since March 2014, when Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith netted against Fulham\nSince the beginning of last season, only Manchester City's Raheem Sterling (six), has won more Premier League penalties than Crystal Palace's Wifried Zaha (five)\nWhat next?\nEverton look to continue their winning run when they visit Manchester United on 28 October at 16:00 GMT.\nPalace begin a tough run of fixtures when they host Arsenal at Selhurst Park on the same day (13:30)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-1 Leicester City: Ozil turns in stunning display for Gunners\nMesut Ozil produced one of the best midfield displays in the Premier League this season as Arsenal beat Leicester to record a 10th successive win in all competitions.\nOzil's first-time finish for the equaliser, the pass that led to the second goal and his two flicks in the build-up to the third were the catalyst for a remarkable performance by the Gunners, who had been overwhelmed by Leicester in the opening 30 minutes.\nRelive the action from Emirates Stadium\nThe Foxes deservedly took the lead in the 31st minute, and might argue they should already have been awarded a penalty when Rob Holding appeared to intentionally handle the ball.\nTheir goal came from a pacy counter-attack, which resulted in Ben Chilwell's attempt at a low cross being turned in by the boot of Arsenal's Hector Bellerin.\nThat appeared to jolt the Gunners into action. They levelled just before the break when Ozil sprinted forward and played a one-two with Bellerin before opening up his foot to place the ball in off the far post. It was a stunning finish.\nArsenal, who came into the match having scored 14 of their 19 league goals in the second half, were a different proposition after the break.\nTheir second goal came after Ozil cut open the defence with a beautifully weighted ball which found Bellerin. The Spaniard then played it square for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who tapped home two minutes after coming on.\nThe Gabon international's second followed one of the moves of the season. Ozil's audacious flick in midfield set it in motion, before a sand-wedge of an assist by the German gave Aubameyang a simple finish.\nAlexandre Lacazette should have added another but his shot, from Ozil's pass, was saved at point-blank range by Kasper Schmeichel.\nOzil's renaissance fires Arsenal\nA poor 2017-18 season, a rotten World Cup and a row which resulted in him quitting international football - Ozil's lead-up to this campaign could not have been worse.\nBut something has suddenly clicked for him. Has new manager Unai Emery had an effect? Is Ozil trying to prove a point to members of German football's hierarchy who openly criticised him?\nAccused at times of being lackadaisical in his midfield running, he was anything but for the equaliser when he burst forward before producing a feather-light finish. His 30th league goal meant he became the highest scoring German player in the competition's history.\nThe confidence grew in the midfielder, and in Arsenal, in the second half. First Ozil's threaded ball resulted in the second before he delved into his box of tricks for the third - a goal reminiscent of those scored under Emery's predecessor.\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has a big job on his hands to keep Ozil and his Arsenal side quiet when they visit Selhurst Park next Sunday.\nFoxes regret early missed chances\nLeicester might be wondering how they failed to earn at least a point after an impressive opening 30-minute spell.\nArsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno was twice tested, blocking Kelechi Iheanacho's effort before he pushed away Harry Maguire's header, which seemed destined for the net.\nAnd when it wasn't the German, it was referee Chris Kavanagh who frustrated the visitors. His decision in the 18th minute not to award a penalty for Holding's handball incensed manager Claude Puel on the touchline.\nTheir goal, via Bellerin's boot, was just reward but after earlier bad luck, perhaps Puel and his team knew it was not going to be their day.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\n'Ozil's commitment is very good' - manager quotes\nArsenal boss Unai Emery:\n\"It was good in the second half, and we finished well in the first half. We started cold maybe.\n\"The progression in the 90 minutes was good and we played with good attitude and level in our quality. The victory is a big one and we deserved it.\n\"Each match and training Ozil's commitment is very good. The players are working and helping each other. The performance of the team and also with Mesut was very good.\n\"A good result and good goals - the team was only missing the first 30 minutes.\"\nLeicester boss Claude Puel on the decision not to award a penalty to his side:\n\"I am angry about it because of all the good work by my players. I thought it was a penalty, we saw this from the bench. All the people in the stadium saw this was a penalty - it was handball.\n\"It is not possible to have another decision other than a penalty, and also it was another yellow card and sending off.\n\"I didn't speak to the referee afterwards because it is finished and we can't come back with another decision. But I regret this decision because all the people in the stadium saw this decision was wrong.\n\"The penalty is an important thing, but also afterwards we needed to score more and be more clinical.\"\nAubameyang's heavy influence - the stats\nArsenal have won 10 consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since October 2007 (a run of 12).\nIn all competitions, Leicester are winless in their last 26 visits to Arsenal (P26 W0 D6 L20) since winning 2-0 in the top flight in September 1973.\nLeicester are winless in their last eight Premier League away games in London (D3 L5), losing the last three in a row.\nAubameyang has been directly involved in 21 goals in his 22 Premier League games for Arsenal (16 goals, five assists).\nArsenal have scored more Premier League goals via substitutes this season than any other team (six).\nOzil became the highest scoring German player in Premier League history (30 goals) ahead of Jurgen Klinsmann and Uwe Rosler (both 29).\nOzil has scored three goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as he bagged in his previous 22 in the competition.\nBellerin scored his first own goal in the Premier League in what was his 133rd appearance in the competition. The Spanish defender also provided two assists in a Premier League game for the fourth time in his career.\nWhat's next?\nAfter facing Sporting Lisbon in the Europa League on Thursday (17:55 BST) they travel to Palace on Sunday (13:30 GMT). The Foxes host West Ham next Saturday (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-3 AFC Bournemouth: Callum Wilson heaps misery on struggling hosts\nCallum Wilson scored twice to help Bournemouth continue their fast start to the Premier League season - and inflict another damaging defeat on Fulham.\nIn an open game at Craven Cottage, the visitors opened the scoring from the penalty spot after Wilson was clumsily fouled by Timothy Fosu-Mensah early on.\nThe hosts had chances throughout but were never as clinical as the visitors - a fact highlighted when the Cherries turned defence to attack before David Brooks' composed finish for their second.\nFulham's Kevin McDonald was sent off for a second bookable offence late on, and Wilson scored his second and Bournemouth's third to wrap up victory and condemn the Cottagers to their fourth straight defeat, having conceded 15 goals along the way.\nWeary sections of the home support met the full-time whistle with jeers and the defeat means the Cottagers' remain 18th and in the relegation zone.\nMeanwhile, Eddie Howe's men stay sixth and have closed the gap on Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham - the teams above them - to one point.\nRelive Fulham's defeat to Bournemouth as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nThe home side did have their moments, but mustered just a single effort on target, which came when Andre Schurrle stung the palms of Asmir Begovic from outside the box after Bournemouth's opener.\nAboubakar Kamara and Denis Odoi went wide with headed efforts as Fulham tried to find a way back, but when Wilson set Fraser away to set up the second goal, it was effectively game over.\nMoments later, a sloppy pass from Odoi saw goalscorer Brooks intercept before McDonald brought him down to earn a second yellow from referee Andre Marriner.\nKamara, who often cut a frustrated figure, could have joined McDonald when he kicked the ball away when on a yellow, but he was given a reprieve.\nHowever, it was little help to Fulham's cause. Bournemouth completed the victory when Fraser fed Wilson in space before the Englishman struck his fifth goal of the season.\nWoe and worry for Fulham\nIn many respects, Bournemouth are the template that promoted Premier League sides would like to copy - exciting to watch and watertight at the back.\nAt times, Fulham fulfilled the first part - but their porous defence stands to prohibit their chances of remaining in the top flight next season.\nHaving conceded four in defeat to fellow strugglers Cardiff last time out, Jokanovic appeared to go back to basics with a 4-4-1-1 formation. But from the outset, the visitors stifled any attempt at game management from the home side.\nIt can't help confidence that Fulham are the only side to have conceded in every league game this season.\nBut just as Cardiff's purposeful start rattled the Cottagers last week, so too did Bournemouth's this time. When Wilson was felled, there were no appeals against the penalty decision and a sense of inevitability crept in.\nThat mood that was briefly lifted by captain Tom Cairney's return as a substitute on the hour after two months out injured, but when Brooks added a second the point of no return was reached.\nJokanovic said before this game that \"seasons are full of good and less good afternoons\" - and it's becoming easy to forget that this is a club who enjoyed the ultimate high of winning a Championship play-off final just a few months ago.\nIf the Londoners can't stop the rot at Huddersfield on Monday week, though, the questions about how many more afternoons Jokanovic will see as Fulham boss will intensify.\nBournemouth in bloom\nIt is probably fair to assume that Sunday's papers will focus on forlorn Fulham, rather than Howe's buoyant Bournemouth.\nPerhaps just as well then, that the visitors' and their 2,500-or-so-strong support made sure to come together and savour this result at the final whistle.\nThe Cherries are now in esteemed company at the top of the table, just behind the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham who play on Sunday.\nOn showings like this, it feels patronising to say Howe's side are greater than the sum of their parts, but even without the injured Joshua King, this was a professional job well done - and evidence that their league position is merited.\nIn attack, their front men are potent, with Wilson stating afterwards his belief that Bournemouth are \"flourishing\" this season.\nThe sweeping nature of their two goals from counter-attacks in the second half served as a case in point, while in defence they have now kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for just the second time.\nIf Howe's side can play in the same way against Jose Mourinho's Manchester United a week from now, aspirations of a tilt at qualifying for European football in 2019-20 will start to feel far from fanciful.\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson (Bournemouth)\n'I'm not thinking about my future' - what they said\nFulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: \"We have enough quality to score but we can't find a way to find a clean sheet. The Premier League is tough not just for us but for many clubs. We are making expensive mistakes.\n\"I am not thinking about my future. I will be ready for the next challenge. I am living my present and that is today a very hard defeat. I must be brave and keep going and encourage my team.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We knew it would be tough against a good side. They have good players who can hurt you.\n\"We were defensively very good. It was a better performance than the Watford one [a 4-0 away win] where we also played well and got a lot of plaudits.\"\nSuccess at both ends for Bournemouth - the stats\nFulham have lost four consecutive league games for the first time since August 2014, when they were in the Championship.\nBournemouth have won four of their last six away games in the Premier League (L2), as many as they had in their previous 27 away trips in the competition.\nFulham have conceded 28 goals in the Premier League this term, the joint-most after 10 games in the division's history (tied with Barnsley in 1997-98 and Southampton in 2012-13).\nBournemouth have won six penalties in the Premier League this season (5 scored), already twice as many as they did in the whole of the 2017-18 campaign (3 won, 3 scored).\nCallum Wilson has been directly involved in 10 goals in his last 11 appearances in the Premier League (six goals and four assists).\nBournemouth midfielder David Brooks has scored three goals in his last four league appearances, as many as he had in his previous 35.\nBournemouth have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for just the second time, last doing so in November 2017.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides feature in next week's fourth round of the EFL Cup, with Bournemouth hosting Championship club Norwich City on Tuesday, 30 October (19:45 GMT) and Fulham on the road at Manchester City on Thursday, 1 November (19:45).\nThe Cherries then welcome Manchester United in the early Premier League kick-off on Saturday, 3 November (12:30), with the Cottagers next in league action away at Huddersfield on Monday, 5 November (20:00)."

But we have many things to improve.\n\"I always expect the best of players, I know what they are capable of and I know they will always focus on the next game.\"\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner, to MOTD: \"Defensively this was not the performance we wanted. We didn't look solid, stable or compact. In open play we were not aggressive enough or making them uncomfortable.\n\"Defensively we were not good enough to collect points, you have to use your opportunities and we have not done that today.\n\"I am disappointed because in recent weeks we had defended better, but it was our worst performance defensively for a while.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Newcastle in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Huddersfield welcome Fulham to the John Smith's Stadium the following Monday (20:00)."

Our fans were fantastic, they know we are up against it. The lads gave everything. It was so quiet when Paterson scored, you had to dream of a comeback.\"\nIt is worth remembering how far Cardiff have come in a short space of time.\nTwo years ago they ended October 21st in the Championship.

The fans realise it's a difficult situation and they got behind the team.\n\"In the circumstances it is a positive result, a clean sheet and one point away.\"\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nHow the action unfolded at St Mary's\nBertrand eyes England recall\nSouthampton forward Charlie Austin did put the ball in the back of the net in the second half - but only after fouling Dubravka in a collision that eventually saw Austin withdrawn.\nAnd, in an eventful finale, Shane Long looked destined to score but dragged his effort wide before Jack Stephens narrowly failed to meet James Ward-Prowse's floated free-kick in stoppage time.\nThe result means it is no win in six for Hughes' side, who remain 16th in the table and have now failed to score in their last five in the league.\nBenitez's winless side, meanwhile, moved off the foot of the table courtesy of Huddersfield's defeat by Watford.\nShooting issues for winless Magpies\nFollowing defeat by Brighton last weekend, the club's seventh loss in their opening nine games, Newcastle fell to the foot of the Premier League table, prompting manager Benitez to admit the current situation had become the toughest of his managerial career to date.\nAnd, after failing to score in that 1-0 defeat - despite producing 27 shots on goal - the Spaniard called on his side to be \"more precise and clinical\" for their trip to St Mary's.\nBut the Magpies failed to register a shot on target, in what appeared a crucial game for both sides on the south coast.\nIndeed, they rarely threatened throughout and were lucky to leave with a point - their third of the season - as they failed to record a win in their opening 10 matches of a league season for the first time in 120 years.\nThe visitors had goalkeeper Dubravka to thank on several occasions, while the desire of the back-four to block shots demonstrated the sort of fight the Newcastle players must continue to show if they are to stand a chance of surviving in the top-flight this season.\nDefeats for Cardiff, Fulham and Huddersfield ensured the bottom of the table remains tight, but Benitez cannot rely on the misfortunes of other clubs and a positive result against Watford is now imperative.\nSaints unable to climb away from trouble\nLast week's goalless draw with south coast neighbours Bournemouth was described as a \"statement\" performance by manager Hughes, as his side ended a dismal run of three straight league defeats.\nThough that point drew a line under a difficult period, another stalemate at home to Newcastle extended Saints' winless run as well as their drought in front of goal - on an afternoon that could have allowed Hughes' side to create daylight between themselves and the relegation places.\nIt was a familiar case of missed opportunities for Southampton, who, like Newcastle, have only registered six league goals so far, as the hosts failed to find a breakthrough despite their 22 attempts.\nLemina was often Saints' biggest threat going forward and was unlucky to be denied by the post, while Ryan Bertrand and Cedric Soares offered excellent offensive support from the flanks.\nDefender Jack Stephens' proved dangerous from set-pieces and saw a powerful header saved by the alert Dubravka just before the interval.\nBut the final few minutes, as Stephens' went agonisingly close to securing the points and Long failed to hit the target from close-range, summed up Southampton's predicament in front of goal so far this season.\nAt the back, Hughes' side were solid. But their proximity to the drop-zone after 10 games is a growing concern and, with champions Manchester City arriving at St Mary's next weekend, pressure on Hughes will likely continue to mount.\n\"It's disappointing once again in respect of not getting what we deserved, we had 22 shots and we weren't able to convert any of them,\" said Hughes.\n\"At the end of the day it's back-to-back clean sheets, but at the top end of the pitch we need to start scoring goals.\n\"Clearly we are creating chances, right at the death we had a good chance for Shane, there were balls bobbling around the box, but sometimes you need something to go in off someone's backside and the football gods aren't smiling on us at the moment.\"\nMan of the match - Mario Lemina (Southampton)\nWorst start for 120 years - the stats\nNewcastle have failed to win any of their opening 10 matches of a league season for just the second time in their history - last doing so 120 years ago in the 1898-99 top-flight campaign.\nEach of the last six sides who failed to win any of their opening 10 Premier League matches went on to be relegated.\nNewcastle United are now winless in each of their last eight away games in the Premier League, losing five and last winning on the road in April.\nSouthampton have failed to win any of their opening five home league matches at home for the first time since 2001-02.\nAnd the Saints have failed to score in five straight Premier League matches for the first time since April 2001.\nSouthampton winger Nathan Redmond has now had 19 shots in the Premier League this season, more than any other player yet to score a single goal in the competition so far.\nOf managers he has faced at least 10 times in the Premier League, against no other has Southampton manager Mark Hughes won fewer matches against in the competition than current Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez (P14 W1 D7 L6).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton are in league cup action on Tuesday night (19:30 GMT) as they travel to face Leicester in the round of 16, before welcoming Manchester City to St Mary's on Sunday (15:00 GMT).\nNewcastle host Watford on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Brighton 1-0 Wolves: Murray scores 100th Brighton goal in victory\nGlenn Murray said he was \"immensely proud\" to score his 100th Brighton goal against Wolves, which secured the Seagulls' third consecutive Premier League win.\nMurray, who was a doubt for the game after suffering concussion last weekend, turned Bruno's scuffed shot in from close range shortly after half-time.\nThe Englishman is now Brighton's second all-time leading scorer and is only the second player to score 100 goals for the club.\n\"I've had some special moments here at the Amex. I've been here a long time and I'm immensely proud of scoring 100 goals for the club,\" he told the club's website.\n\"It was a special moment as far as getting the three points was concerned.\n\"Now that I've got 100 goals, I want to move on to 101 goals and get as many as I can this season.\"\nThe win sees Brighton earn three consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since 1981 - in a game that was dominated by their opponents.\nWolves, with greater possession and more on-target shots, were unfortunate not to come away with at least a point.\nThey came close through Matt Doherty, who shot just wide of the post from 10 yards early on, and could have had a first-half penalty when another effort from Doherty hit the raised arm of Jose Izquierdo.\nShane Duffy headed off the outside of the post at the end of the first half for Brighton but Murray's goal was the hosts' only shot on target in the game.\nWolves pressed hard for an equaliser in a remarkable finish with Brighton's goalkeeper Mat Ryan saving brilliantly from Ryan Bennett in stoppage time.\nRyan also dived low to stop Ruben Neves' strike from distance while Doherty had another chance blocked wide.\nBrighton climb to 11th with the win while Wolves stay ninth.\nBrighton fan dies at Wolves match\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nBrighton v Wolves as it happened\nMurray shows worth to Brighton\nIn total, Wolves had 25 shots to Brighton's seven but the three points were decided by Murray's clinical finish, plus a bit of fortune.\nBrighton were lucky Bruno's mis-hit shot fell to their top scorer but he instinctively directed the ball inside the post from seven yards.\nIt was the striker's only shot of the game - a game he might well not have played.\nEven on Friday, manager Chris Hughton had said he was yet to decide whether Murray would play after his concussion at Newcastle last Saturday but the Englishman once again proved how crucial he is to his side.\nAfter the match Hughton praised Murray's desire to play in the game, adding that he did not see any reluctance from the striker to play.\n\"Glenn always was adamant he was fine, he wanted to play,\" said Hughton.\n\"Because we followed the protocol, we knew that medically he was fine to play so then really it's about the player.\n\"He's somebody who wants to play and wants to play as many games as possible.\n\"My thoughts were always to play him, if we were able to. He's somebody that's desperate to score goals.\"\nThe goal was Murray's sixth in 10 games this season - one less than the league's top scorer Eden Hazard - and it saw him become just the second player to score 100 goals for Brighton, after Tommy Cook did so in the 1920s.\nMurray has scored 40% of Brighton's goals since their return to the Premier League and he has scored in three of their four wins this season.\nWolves unfortunate to lose again\nThis defeat is Wolves' second in a row in the league.\nLast week their manager Nuno Espirito Santo criticised their performance but he had no similar complaints this weekend, though he was upset that his side conceded from Brighton's only chance.\nNuno made a change to his starting line-up for the first time this season - replacing Diogo Jota with Adama Traore to end their record-breaking nine-game run without a change - and, but for a 15-minute spell either side of half-time, Wolves dominated the game.\nDoherty impressed again in the right wing-back role but could have scored twice with better finishing.\nWhen introduced off the bench, Jota added impetus in the closing stages and also had a shot saved by Ryan.\nWolves' best chance, and Ryan's best save, came in the 93rd minute to deny Bennett.\nThe Wolves centre-back met a cross seven yards out in the centre of the goal but his well-hit strike was palmed away by Ryan diving to his right.\nIt is credit to Wolves' excellent start back in the Premier League that they remain in the top half despite losing their last two games. The overall performance suggested they should have little fear of the losing run continuing for too long.\n\"The only moment I am disappointed with is when we conceded,\" Nuno said.\n\"We did enough to deserve a different result, we bounced back from the last game. We must be optimistic.\n\"All the game we were trying to win, we had many chances and we conceded the only chance they had - that disappoints me.\n\"It is a moment that requires focus. From a throw-in you cannot concede a goal. The result was not for us but the performance was good.\nBrighton's impressive defensive run\nAll three of Brighton's consecutive wins have been by a 1-0 margin and they have now equalled their club record of three consecutive top-flight clean sheets.\nThat comes after they conceded in all of their first eight matches.\nAs well as the excellent Ryan, Duffy and centre-back partner Lewis Dunk again impressed by heading the ball away consistently.\nThey each completed nine clearances - five more than any other player on the field.\n\"Dunk and Duffy, they are massive for us,\" goal scorer Murray said. \"We struggled for clean sheets at the start of the season but we have got our ship together and it's huge for confidence.\"\nHughton said: \"I am delighted, we had to really earn it against a very good side. They threatened a lot and we had to defend really well. It was hard-earned.\n\"We are not playing at our best, nowhere near. We have players who are not at their level, we are not good on the ball but we are defending really well.\"\nMan of the match - Mat Ryan (Brighton)\nWolves beaten by bogey team - the best stats\nBrighton have won three consecutive games in the top-flight for the first time since May 1981 (when they had a run of four wins).\nWolves have lost back-to-back league games for the first time under Nuno Espirito Santo, with the club previously doing so back in April 2017.\nBrighton have won each of their seven top-flight games against Wolves - the best 100% record for a team against a single opponent in English top-flight history.\nAfter losing just one of their first eight games of the Premier League season (W4 D3), Wolves have now lost two games in a row.\nBrighton striker Glenn Murray has scored six goals in his last eight starts in the Premier League, with five of those coming at the Amex.\nAt the age of 38 years and 26 days, Brighton defender Bruno (Bruno Saltor Grau - known as Bruno) is the oldest player to assist a Premier League goal since Jussi Jaaskelainen (38y 257d) on New Year's Day 2014 for West Ham against Fulham.\nBrighton scored with their only shot on target of the game, with Glenn Murray doing so in the 48th minute.\nWhat's next?\nWolves host Tottenham in their next game at 19:45 GMT next Saturday. Brighton play Everton at Goodison Park the same day at 15:00."

He went close with a header and late in the game had a fierce strike saved by Fabianski.\nWith the Hammers poised to take all three points, Ndidi's long-range shot took a wicked deflection off Balbuena to beat Fabianski.\nThere was concern at the end of the game, as Leicester right-back Daniel Amartey left the pitch on a stretcher in injury-time in some pain with an injury to his ankle.\nPuel addressed the Vardy rumours at the end of the game, he said: \" I don't know why it is a problem.\n\"I wanted him to come on in the second half to win the game.

        "article_text": "Chelsea beat Burnley 4-0 as unbeaten Blues go second in Premier League\nRoss Barkley's performance in inspiring Chelsea to a comfortable victory at Burnley is evidence that he is a \"complete\" player, head coach Maurizio Sarri says.\nThe England midfielder scored one goal and set up two more as Sarri's unbeaten side moved second in the Premier League.\nBarkley set up the visitors' 22nd-minute opener, sliding a wonderful through ball for Alvaro Morata to poke past Burnley keeper Joe Hart.\nHe then scored himself, sending a 25-yard shot into the bottom corner of Hart's net just before the hour mark.\nFive minutes later, he registered his second assist of the match, as he set up Willian, to cut in on to his right foot and curl a shot past Hart into the same corner.\nRuben Loftus-Cheek, who scored a midweek hat-trick in the Europa League, added a fourth in injury time to seal the win.\nBarkley, 24, joined Chelsea from Everton for \u00a315m in January, but barely featured under Antonio Conte, playing just four games.\nHe has been a player reborn since Sarri arrived in July, earning an England recall and scoring in three consecutive Premier League games, the first Englishman to do so since Frank Lampard in February 2013.\n\"Barkley is doing very well in this period,\" said Sarri. \"He improved in the defensive phase, improved very much. He improved his physical condition because the last season for him was really very difficult.\n\"He's a very good player from the technical point of view. Now I think Ross is complete.\"\nBarkley added: \"I am made up with how things are going, we are chipping in with the goals. I believe we can stay in the title race.\"\nChelsea are two points behind leaders Liverpool and one ahead of Manchester City, who play Tottenham on Monday night.\nBurnley, who stay in 15th, barely threatened and were reduced to chasing Chelsea's shadows for much of the game.\nLive reaction to Chelsea's win\nNo Hazard, no problem\nSarri's side were without their star Belgium forward and top goalscorer Eden Hazard, who missed the game with a back injury.\nThe exceptional Willian and Barkley more than made up for his loss, while Morata looked like a striker brimming with confidence.\n\"For 10 minutes it was difficult at the beginning but then we played very well,\" said Chelsea's head coach. \"I am very happy for Alvaro Morata and Loftus-Cheek again. We played very well in full control of the match for the last 80 minutes.\"\nMorata could easily have had a first half hat-trick. Hart tipped over an instinctive header in the 12th minute, and after his opener, the forward ran on to a Willian pass and turned Ben Mee, but dragged his shot wide of the near post with the goalkeeper to beat.\nMore chances came for the former Real Madrid and Juventus striker, as he controlled a ball over the top from Jorginho and tried his luck with an acrobatic effort but sent his half-volley clear of the bar. Just after the break, he glanced over with a header at the near post.\nMorata jogged straight down the tunnel as he came off in the 74th minute to be replaced by France's World Cup winner Olivier Giroud, who looked as if he was on a one-man mission to break his club goal duck for the season.\nHart tipped his header on to the bar in injury time, and he then tried to guide an ambitious volley into the top corner.\nSarri said he was \"disappointed\" for Giroud, adding that \"he needs to score\".\nBurnley gave Barkley and Willian far too much respect as the pair caused countless problems; the only blemish on the Brazilian's afternoon was receiving a yellow card in the first-half for diving.\nAn injury to Pedro in the 30th minute enabled Loftus-Cheek to come on and get some valuable Premier League minutes under his belt, while there was also time for Cesc Fabregas to make his first league appearance of the season.\nSarri said he will not rest Hazard, when the Belgium returns, but says he is unlikely to play in the Carabao Cup in midweek.\n\"I want Hazard in every match if it's possible because we have a lot of very good players but Hazard, I think, is something different,\" added Sarri.\n\"I am very happy because the team was able to score seven goals in two matches without Hazard. It's a very good sign. I want Eden as soon as possible. I don't know for Wednesday but I hope for Sunday [against Crystal Palace].\"\nFloodgates open for Burnley\nThe home side started the beginning of each half with intensity and took the game to Chelsea, but soon dropped off the pace as the visitors enjoyed almost 70% possession.\nSean Dyche's side built last season's success on their defence, but they have conceded nine goals in two games, having shipped five against Manchester City last week.\nNeither Barkley nor Willian were closed down for their long-range goals, while Hart was needed to make a string of saves. Going forward, they managed just one shot on target.\nBurnley continue to struggle against the 'big six' teams at home and have taken just two points from their past 13 games at Turf Moor against those sides, losing 11.\nThey did show plenty of fight, exemplified with James Tarkowski and Morata's running battle, which resulted in the pair getting booked just before half-time.\nDyche was at least able to give 90 minutes to two players who are fit again after long-term knee injuries, as Robbie Brady made his first appearance since December 2017 and Steven Defour also played.\n\"On reflection, we have played two top sides back to back in City and Chelsea, who have delivered top performances and it's hard to deal with that,\" said Dyche. \"It was a top side doing what top sides do; they finish clinically.\n\"Ever since Leicester threw the form book out of the window, the superpowers have moved forwards. They have deeper squads, and it is getting more difficult to compete. If you look at the table, the only real anomaly at the moment is Manchester United.\"\nMan of the match - Ross Barkley (Chelsea)\nStats - Sarri's record-breaking start\nBurnley are yet to beat Chelsea at Turf Moor in a Premier League match - their last home league win over the Blues was in April 1983 in the second tier.\nChelsea are unbeaten after the first 10 games of a top-flight season for just the fifth time in their history alongside 1964-65, 1966-67, 2005-06 and 2014-15 - the went on to win the title in the two most recent occasions.\nBarkley was involved in three of Chelsea's goals in this game against Burnley - only the second time in his Premier League career that he's been involved in three goals in a single match and for the first time since November 2015 ,when he was at Everton.\nSarri has become the first Chelsea manager to remain unbeaten in his first 10 Premier League matches in charge of the club.\nTen of Willian's 27 Premier League goals for Chelsea have come from outside the box (37%); more than any other Chelsea player since the Brazilian made his debut in October 2013.\nAfter scoring a hat-trick in the Europa League on Thursday, Ruben Loftus-Cheek scored his second Premier League goal for Chelsea in 25 appearances, 939 days since his first against Aston Villa in April 2016.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Derby County in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (19:45 GMT), before returning to league action against Crystal Palace on Sunday (16:00).\nBurnley travel to West Ham on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-2 Arsenal: Milivojevic scores twice in dramatic draw\nCrystal Palace captain Luka Milivojevic scored twice from the penalty spot to earn his side a dramatic draw and end Arsenal's 11-game winning run.\nThe Serb smashed in a late equaliser after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's controversial goal had put the visitors ahead after the break.\nMilivojevic scored the opener in the first half after Shkodran Mustafi brought down Cheikhou Kouyate.\nGranit Xhaka's sublime free-kick had drawn Arsenal level at 1-1.\nFollow all the Premier League action\nWilfried Zaha was brought down by Xhaka in the box with seven minutes to go and Milivojevic drilled his spot-kick into Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno's right corner, having also beaten him on that side in the first half.\nEarlier in the second half, the ball appeared to brush Alexandre Lacazette's hand before it fell at the back post to Aubameyang, who poked home off the inside of the post - with the ball going over the line by just 9mm.\nBefore his error in bringing down Zaha to give away the late penalty, Xhaka's stunning curler had cancelled out Milivojevic's opener - which was Palace's first goal at home this season.\nZaha also hit the outside of the post before the break, while Andros Townsend dragged a shot wide.\nPalace substitute Max Meyer struck over the bar from close range later in the second half and Alex Iwobi's deflected shot flew wide.\nArsenal remain fourth in the Premier League table, a point behind Manchester City, while Palace move up to 14th and three points above the relegation zone.\nNerves of steel from Milivojevic\nPalace had to wait three months for their first goal at Selhurst Park this season - before Milivojevic provided two against one of the most in-form teams in the league.\nLast week, Jordan Pickford had denied him from the spot in their 2-0 defeat by Everton, but this time Milivojevic held his nerve to ensure Palace did not finish empty-handed against Arsenal.\nThe skipper has now scored 11 of his past 13 penalties for Palace and it was the first time he had netted since scoring against Bournemouth in April.\nHis first goal for Crystal Palace was also a penalty against Arsenal, in their 3-0 home win in April 2017.\nWinning run comes to an end\nArsenal missed an opportunity to move into third place as Manchester City and Tottenham do not face each other until Monday (20:00 GMT kick-off).\nThe result also meant their impressive winning streak came to an end.\nGunners manager Unai Emery's request for a quicker start to the game was not met - and it was Palace who deservedly led at half-time.\nBut Arsenal's intensity increased in familiar fashion after the break and they thought they had completed the comeback and won all three points when Aubameyang's effort just crossed the line.\nLacazette's main involvement in the game was the build-up to that goal. His performance was disappointing and his only shot was a scuffed effort from the edge of the box.\nBut strike partner Aubameyang continued to provide a threat - he has now been directly involved in 22 goals in his 23 Premier League appearances for Arsenal.\nPalace denied the Gunners victory but Emery's side are still just four points off the top and unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions.\nSlow out of the blocks - the best of the stats\nCrystal Palace's opening goal from Milivojevic ended a run of 417 minutes without scoring a league goal at home.\n75% of Arsenal's Premier League goals this season have come in the second half (18 of 24).\nSince the start of last season, Crystal Palace have won more penalties (13) and scored more penalties (10) in the Premier League than any other side.\nSince the start of 2016-17, Arsenal have conceded more penalties (18) and goals from penalties (17) in the league than any other team.\nCrystal Palace midfielder Milivojevic has taken the most (11) and scored the most (nine) penalties in the Premier League since the start of 2017-18.\nSince the start of 2014-15, only Jamie Vardy (13) has won more penalties in the Premier League than Crystal Palace's Zaha (11 - level with Raheem Sterling).\nArsenal have not been leading a game at half-time in the league this season.\nAll five of Xhaka's Premier League goals for the Gunners have come from outside the box.\n'It was tough to concede' - view from the bosses\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson to BBC Sport: \"I'm not even happy to end up with one point especially when you see how clear the handball was. It was tough to concede an equaliser after working so hard for the 1-0 lead.\n\"I thought the attitude of the players and the way we got in control of the game again after going behind, it was a very deserved equaliser. I'm very happy with the performance; I'm just a bit sad it didn't give us the three points.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery on Sky Sports: \"I am disappointed with the result but our work is good.

He took quite a long time to understand what we want from him, quite a long time for his brain and body to be ready for how we want him to play.\n\"At the moment he is solid, playing very well. Even if he doesn't score, to create what he is creating, it is a solid performance for the team. That is what we need.\"\nBernard the bright spark\nGoing into the game, Everton were above their opponents in the league, after a winning streak which had seen them beat Fulham, Leicester and most recently against Crystal Palace with two late goals.\nBut they have now been beaten 36 times in the Premier League by United - a competition record for a single club against one opposition - and are winless in their past 19 games against the established top six.\nAlthough their approach play was eye-catching at times against United, they were left disappointed by poor decision-making or lacklustre finishing in the final third.\nAndre Gomes and Sigurdsson both headed straight at De Gea from promising positions, while Theo Walcott struck efforts which were comfortable for the goalkeeper to gather.\nFree signing Bernard was a bright spark with his nifty footwork and intelligence, but the Brazilian missed a clear-cut opportunity when failing to hit the target from the angle.\nIt proved to be costly as his side failed to gain a point despite being given hope when Sigurdsson netted his fourth goal as a visiting player at Old Trafford after Chris Smalling chopped down Richarlison in the box.\nEverton boss Marco Silva said: \"It was a tough match but we came here to win. It is the only way we work.

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-2 Man Utd: Marcus Rashford hits injury-time winner\nJose Mourinho said he was the \"luckiest manager in the Premier League\" in the first half as Manchester United needed a late Marcus Rashford goal to beat Bournemouth.\nRashford's dramatic injury-time goal snatched the three points for the Red Devils as he netted at the second attempt following Paul Pogba's cross.\nUnited had been fortunate to be level at 1-1 at the interval after a lacklustre first-half display.\n\"The score should have been like 6-2,\" said Mourinho.\n\"We were defensively awful. As a team we didn't press or do any of the work we did in the week. People watching this game will not believe how hard we worked this week.\"\nThe Cherries had come close three times inside the first 10 minutes before a corner was half-cleared to Lewis Cook. The young England midfielder played a superb through pass to Junior Stanislas, whose pinpoint right-wing cross was stabbed in by Callum Wilson.\nAnd the visitors were lucky not to be further behind by the time Ashley Young burst down the right and played in Alexis Sanchez, who cut it back for Anthony Martial to guide home.\nMourinho said \"top teams don't start as bad\" as United did and described the first-half performance as \"chaotic\".\n\"I'm upset with that. The second half was much better. We created lots of chances and deserved to score before the 92nd minute,\" he said.\nUnited nearly took the lead after the break when Young rattled the frame of the goal with a free-kick. Rashford's goal-bound follow-up was cleared off the line by Nathan Ake, before David Brooks hacked Pogba's effort clear.\nBut Rashford eventually found a way through - and victory will lift Mourinho at the start of a week during which his side have two more away trips - to Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, and Manchester City next Sunday.\nMan Utd labour on the road\nOnly a win by a four-goal margin would have allowed eighth-placed United to displace Bournemouth from their lofty position in the top six, but that did not look like happening as they were caught cold early on.\nUnited goalkeeper David de Gea had already been called into action to block efforts by Ryan Fraser and Wilson before Cook opened up the defence and De Gea was given no chance by the in-form Wilson - who, like his manager, was nominated on Friday for a Premier League monthly awards.\nWhile their defence was regularly threatened by the pace of Fraser and Wilson, United were disjointed in midfield, where there was a private battle between the two clubs' record signings to dominate the centre of the park, and attack.\nBournemouth's \u00a325m capture Jefferson Lerma had the better of the \u00a389m Pogba for much of the game, while Sanchez had a frustrating afternoon, often left isolated up front or beseeching referee Paul Tierney to give a decision in his favour.\nBut a double substitution 11 minutes after the interval improved United's fortunes, with Rashford and fellow replacement Ander Herrera both going close.\nIt was the home side who were hanging on by the end, although the visitors still threatened on the break and De Gea stood firm to keep out Brooks before Rashford's late winner.\nBournemouth still standing tall\nIt shows how far Bournemouth have come in their rise through the divisions that a one-goal defeat by Manchester United - in a league fixture whose very existence was unthinkable five years ago - must feel such like a kick in the teeth for their fans.\nIndeed, based on the first quarter of the game, there was only one team here deserving an invitation to a European Super League, as United and others have reportedly been given - and it was not the visitors.\nDespite having been sixth in the table after 10 games, it would be premature to suggest the Cherries are ready to pit their red and black striped shirts against those of AC Milan or other European opposition, but it would have been a different result if they had added a second goal during their period of first-half dominance.\nBournemouth - as ever, so much more than the sum of their parts under Eddie Howe - have the pace and skill in attack to threaten any Premier League team.\nWhile they had to defend in numbers at times - with Steve Cook and particularly Nathan Ake standing tall in central defence until that late winner - Howe's men can count themselves unlucky not to have taken a point.\nBetween now and the end of December, Bournemouth face some stiff tests against the Premier League's elite - with six of their next 10 league and cup fixtures against Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham before they travel to Old Trafford for the return fixture with United on 30 December.\nIf they can maintain a top-half placing in the table by the time 2018 becomes 2019, it will be a considerable achievement for the Dorset club.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford\n'In the first half we were a lucky team'\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"A tough one for us, a lot of our play was really good especially during that opening period. We created chances and we were disappointed we weren't winning at half-time as we deserved to lead by more than one.\n\"They made some good substitutions but I'm very pleased with the effort, That's one of the best first-half performances I've seen since we've been in the Premier League and I can't fault them in terms of effort.\n\"Full credit to Manchester United for sticking in the game, it couldn't have been easy for them, some of our movement was second to none. The first goal we conceded could probably have been avoided.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"When we make a defensive mistake, instead of forgetting it and keeping playing, it triggers instability - like after a couple of minutes of the game with Ryan Fraser facing David de Gea, that triggered instability.\n\"It looked like we don't work tactically during the week, which is the worst thing for me as we work hard. But we have the faith that the game is not over, in the second half I could understand the frustration as we created chances but couldn't score.\"\nLast-gasp Rashford - the stats\nBournemouth lost at home for the first time in seven Premier League games (W4 D2), since losing to Manchester United in April (0-2).\nNo team has come from behind to win more points in the Premier League this season than United (seven, level with Arsenal and Leicester).\nUnited have kept just one clean sheet and conceded 18 goals after 11 Premier League games this season. At this stage last season they had registered eight clean sheets and shipped just five goals.\nMourinho is unbeaten in his 21 Premier League meetings with English managers with United, winning 17 and drawing four.\nIn 11 Premier League appearances this season, Wilson has already equalled his tally of goal involvements from last season (10), achieved in 28 games.\nStanislas has had a hand in four goals in his past five Premier League home games (three goals, one assist), one more than he managed in his previous 14 (three).\nRashford has scored two 90th-minute winning goals in Premier League games for Man Utd - no player has netted more for the club (level with Paul Scholes and Robin van Persie)."

They then beat odds of 5,000-1 to claim the Premier League title in 2015-16 in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time.\nHis death - along with those of Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, pilot Eric Swaffer and his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz - was described as the darkest day in the club's history.\nThe tragedy cast a shadow over the entire city, evident in the outpouring of grief throughout the week from players, staff and supporters.\nHaving postponed Tuesday's Carabao Cup tie against Southampton, this return to action gave Leicester the opportunity to pay their respects on the pitch.\nIt was a decision to which the club gave deep consideration, consulting the Srivaddhanaprabha family and the players, who Vardy said were determined to honour their owner's name with a display of strength.\nThey were wholeheartedly backed by their travelling supporters, most of whom were wearing t-shirts bearing an image of Srivaddhanaprabha's face and the words 'The Boss'.\nDuring the pre-match warm-up, Leicester's players were even given a standing ovation by Cardiff's fans, such was the sense of harmony as the two clubs stood shoulder to shoulder in such extraordinary circumstances.\nThe Foxes rose to the occasion admirably, harnessing the emotion of the occasion and using it to fuel a powerful performance.\nNext, the players will fly to Thailand to attend Srivaddhanaprabha's funeral as Leicester - the club and city - continues to grieve.\nFoxes overcome penalty controversy to get win\nLeicester manager Claude Puel had said beforehand the result was \"not important\", while his Cardiff counterpart Neil Warnock acknowledged football can seem \"irrelevant\" in the aftermath of such a tragedy.\nHowever, they fully supported the decision to play and, after the solemnity of the pre-match tributes, Cardiff City Stadium was at full volume as the game started at a ferocious pace.\nThe hosts set the tempo, pressing their opponents and trying to force them into mistakes.\nThat approach almost bore fruit after half an hour, with an unsettled Leicester defence fouling Harry Arter on the edge of the penalty area and Camarasa striking the resultant free-kick against the crossbar.\nAfter a tricky period in which England centre-back Harry Maguire left the field injured, Leicester eventually got a foothold in the game and had an excellent chance to score when Wilfred Ndidi headed wide from a corner.\nThe Foxes felt they should have had a penalty just before the interval but, although Vardy's shot on the rebound appeared to hit Bamba's arm, referee Lee Probert ignored the visitors' furious protestations.\nIt did not prove to be a costly decision for Puel's side, who made the decisive breakthrough 10 minutes into the second half.\nBen Chilwell sped into the penalty area and clipped a perfectly weighted cross to Gray, who carefully guided his half-volley low into the net to spark emotional celebrations which will live long in the memory.\n'Hopefully we did his family proud' - what they said\nLeicester captain Wes Morgan: \"You can see by our reaction at the end of the game, how much we wanted to get the win and do it for the chairman. We felt the pressure before the game. It was a scrappy game, the lads fought to the very end.\n\"We were very close to the chairman. We know what his wishes were. He used to come down at home games, have a joke and laugh, always say 'want win and three points'. We did that today. It has not been an easy week, we had to try and hold our emotions in today and do the best we can. We have a very emotional connection with the fans, so we stayed till the end and celebrated victory with them.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"It was a normal thing for us to have the players and staff for the minute's silence, it is important for solidarity and we want to give our best for our chairman, step by step, to continue his work.\n\"It is a family and I think Vichai with his warmth, it is a mission to keep this way, and put in place a project that we must try to continue. When we saw the flowers in front of the stadium - it is a family and the feeling that our chairman gave this club.\"\nLeicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel: \"That was a tough game not just on the pitch but mentally. There are a lot of exhausted people in there now but I am proud of this team and the club, the way everyone has handled themselves has been unbelievable. We were very lucky to know Khun Vichai.\n\"Today was difficult, coming out for the warm-up was tough, the first 10 minutes I couldn't steady myself, I was shaking a little bit. But it was nice to get a win to take to Thailand now and hopefully we did his family proud.\"\nCardiff defender Sol Bamba: \"He [Vichai] was a good man. I had the chance to meet him and he was a big loss. It was difficult for us, the whole build-up wasn't easy to handle. But that is not an excuse, the gaffer warned us about this. Obviously we pay respects before and after, but during the game we are professional.\"\nMan of the match - Ben Chilwell\nStats - Cardiff draw a blank again\nCardiff have just one win in their past 15 Premier League games, drawing three and losing 11.\nLeicester are the only side to score in all their Premier League games this season (11 games).\nCardiff have failed to score in six Premier League games this season, a joint-divisional high along with Huddersfield and Southampton.\nLeicester have won seven of their past nine Premier League games against promoted sides (drawn one, lost one).\nLeicester have won three of their past five Premier League away games (lost two), as many victories as they had managed in their previous 12 on the road in the competition (drawn one, lost eight).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester's players travel to Bangkok for the funeral of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and arrive back in midweek to prepare for their home match against Burnley on Saturday, 10 November (15:00 GMT) while Cardiff host Brighton on the same day at 12:30."

For us to play well and score goals we need to do big work.\"\nIt was a deserved win for Everton, although it took a spirited second-half performance to finally overcome a well-organised Brighton.\nThe Seagulls were content to let Everton dominate possession in the opening stages, but were perhaps fortunate not to fall behind when Gylfi Sigurdsson spurned two early opportunities.\nEverton did eventually take the lead from a Brighton corner, with Sigurdsson leading the counter-attack from inside his own half before teeing up Richarlison, who finished first time beyond goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\nRelive the action from Goodison Park\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League games\nBrighton showed spirit to hit back almost straight away with a clever short corner routine, with Solly March's cross headed home by Dunk for his first goal since March.\nBut Everton were dominant after the break. Idrissa Gueye had already hit the post before Coleman drove Everton in front five minutes into the second half.\nIt was a lead Everton never looked like losing, and Richarlison put the game beyond doubt late on by capitalising on a loose pass by Dunk before rounding Ryan to score.\nRicharlison shines again\nAlmost exactly 12 months ago, Richarlison scored for Watford at Goodison Park in a 3-2 win for Everton that lifted the struggling Toffees out of the relegation zone.\nThe 21-year-old would score just once more that season, mirroring a dramatic dip in form for the Hornets that saw manager Marco Silva sacked in January.\nSilva and Richarlison were reunited at Goodison Park this summer and the Brazilian once again seems to be thriving under the Portuguese's stewardship.\nAfter beginning the season out wide, he has been deployed as a central striker in recent weeks and his two goals against Brighton mean he has now scored more goals this season than he did in the whole of the last campaign.\nSigurdsson is another player whose influence is growing after a difficult 2017-18. The \u00a345m signing from Swansea was pushed out to the left for much of last season but looks far more comfortable playing in a central position.\nThe 29-year-old had a 100% pass completion rate during the first half, which included running half the length of the field to tee up Richarlison for a fine opening goal.\nThis win was further evidence that Everton are starting to settle under Silva as they look to improve on last season's eighth-place finish.\nThe former Hull boss was even able bring on summer signing Yerry Mina in stoppage time for his Everton debut, with the Colombian defender finally fit again after suffering a foot injury at the World Cup.\nLack of cutting edge costs Seagulls\nBrighton went into this game full of confidence after three successive victories without conceding a goal.\nThey had less possession than their opponents in each of those three wins, so it was no surprise that they were content to sit back here.\nEven after falling behind, the Seagulls remained patient, willing to wait for their chance to counter-attack and threaten from set pieces.\nBut aside from Dunk's equaliser, which came from a quickly taken short corner, the visitors failed to truly test Jordan Pickford in the Toffees' goal.\nBrighton only managed three efforts on target all game, with Alireza Jahanbakhsh's late shot coming when the result was already beyond them.\nGlenn Murray has scored half of Brighton's Premier League goals this season and the 35-year-old needs more support if they are to maintain their position in mid-table.\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Everton)\n'Our best performance of the season'\nEverton boss Marco Silva: \"It was our best performance at home this season. First 30 minutes, we played really well. The only thing I didn't like was that corner when they scored. We worked for and prepared for - you need to react faster. What I liked was the second half. We kept doing what we did in the first half. We had chances to score more and it was a good and deserved win.\n\"For us it is important to do better than last season. We want to give the fans something to enjoy and feel a connection with what we are doing.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"We weren't in the game long enough in the second half. They got the goal and their tails were up. We then played two up front but were up against a quality team.\n\"You kick on by accepting you are Brighton, playing a second season in the Premier league. There will be ups and downs. We were playing a team who will push for the top six. You always have to look as a whole. We have had three really good results and then a bad result. We have to accept that and be better next time. Come out fighting in the next game.\"\nEverton win again - the stats\nEverton have enjoyed four wins in their past five Premier League games (L1), as many victories as they managed in their previous 14 in the competition.\nBrighton have never won away at Everton in any competition, drawing two and losing five of their seven visits.\nBrighton have managed just one win in their past 19 Premier League away games, drawing five and losing 13.\nAll 11 of Everton forward Richarlison's Premier League goals have come under manager Marco Silva (11 in 33 apps under Silva, 0 in 14 apps under Javi Gracia).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been directly involved in six goals in his past seven Premier League appearances for Everton (five goals, one assist), as many as he managed in his previous 19 games in the competition.\n10 of Lewis Dunk's 12 league goals for Brighton have been headers.\nEverton's Seamus Coleman found the back of the net for the first time in 26 Premier League appearances, since scoring against Crystal Palace on 21 January 2017.\nWhat's next?\nEverton face a trip to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea on Sunday, November 11 at 14:15 GMT. Brighton are away from home against Cardiff the previous day at 12:30 GMT."

        "article_text": "West Ham 4-2 Burnley: Anderson double downs Clarets\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini said Felipe Anderson put in a \"massive\" performance as his two goals helped the Hammers beat Burnley.\nThe Brazilian midfielder joined the east London club from Lazio for \u00a336m in July, but has struggled for consistency thus far, scoring just one goal before Saturday's game at London Stadium.\nPellegrini even said Anderson was \"bad\" in West Ham's Carabao Cup defeat to Tottenham, in which he was replaced by Robert Snodgrass at half-time.\n\"I said before the game that maybe some players need more time to adapt to the league, but his commitment has always been 100%,\" said Pellegrini.\n\"I talked a lot with him, and there was never a chance of him not playing. He knew from the beginning that despite playing bad against Tottenham, he was going to play. It was a massive performance.\"\nThe Hammers opened the scoring when Arnautovic dispossessed James Tarkowski before racing clear and firing home before Johann Berg Gudmundsson slotted home to equalise just before the break.\nThe hosts then retook the lead when the excellent Anderson curled a shot past Burnley keeper Joe Hart before second-half substitute Chris Wood's thumping header hauled the visitors level again.\nAnderson, who was at the heart of everything West Ham did well, scored his second of the match six minutes from time, capitalising on some sloppy Burnley defending.\nHernandez completed the victory in injury time with a fine dinked finish which finished off a move started by Anderson in midfield.\nIt was a deserved victory for Pellegrini's side, whose previous victory was over Manchester United on September 29, are now 13th in the table two places above the Clarets.\nBurnley, who have now lost six of their past nine games against West Ham, had Hart to thank on several occasions, with the former England and Manchester City goalkeeper saving well to deny Arnautovic either side of the break.\nAnderson spearheads Hammers victory\nDespite a winless October, the Hammers dominated throughout, slicing through Burnley at will, with Anderson the key player.\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian took more touches (103) and played more passes (75) than anyone else on the pitch, illustrating his heavy influence on the game.\nHe scored West Ham's second, with a precise finish after being found in space by the excellent Grady Diangana.\nAnd he claimed his second goal to restore West Ham's lead, his low shot cannoning into the net via a deflection off a despairing Ben Mee.\nHe was also involved in his side's fourth, it was his sublime cross-field pass that began the attack which led to the goal.\n\"I am delighted for him because we know what he can give us,\" said Pellegrini of Anderson's performance.\nYoung Englishman Diangana also stood out. The 20-year-old winger was direct in his approach and he gave Clarets left-back Charlie Taylor a torrid afternoon.\nHe made five key passes, more than any of his team-mates, and provided the assist for the Hammers' second goal.\nBurnley's struggles continue\nAfter successive thumpings by Manchester City and Chelsea, Clarets boss Sean Dyche would have looked at this match as one his side needed to take points from.\nBut despite their resilience, which saw them equalise twice, they did not deserve anything from the game.\nThey were forced onto the back foot from the first whistle and struggled to gain any momentum at any point.\nDyche was animated over what he thought was a foul in the build-up to West Ham's second goal, but ultimately it proved inconsequential as the Brazilian stuck again before Hernandez added a fourth, consigning Burnley to their third defeat in a row.\nThey have conceded 13 goals in their past three league matches, and it could have been more against the Hammers with Mee and Hart both putting in impressive performances.\nMan of the match - Felipe Anderson\n'We could have scored more' - what they said\nWest Ham United boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"We needed to win because we have had a lot of games where have created chances but not won. Yes, we could have scored more.\n\"The first and most important thing is we won the game. We have been playing well and creating chances but we have either drawn or lost. We trust the way we play. I think the fans enjoyed this and in the moments of bad results I have always felt they were behind the team.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We reacted well to falling behind. The mentality and energy were good in the first half. The third goal is a real blow and we are chasing the game when they score the last one.\n\"I'm not disappointed with the mentality of the team but we can't give away the ball so cheaply. There are some details in that game that need working on.\"\nHernandez scores from the bench again - the best of the stats\nBurnley have won just once in their last eight Premier League away games (D2 L5), losing four of the last five.\nThe Clarets have failed to keep a clean sheet in nine of their last 10 Premier League games, shipping at least twice in six of those contests.\nChris Wood has been directly involved in five goals in three Premier League games versus West Ham (four goals, one assist).\nSince the start of last season, Johann Berg Gudmundsson has been directly involved in 16 Premier League goals (four goals, 12 assists) - more than any other Burnley player.\nWest Ham's Marko Arnautovic is now the highest goalscorer in all competitions at the London Stadium (nine goals).\nOnly Jermain Defoe (24) and Olivier Giroud (19) have scored more goals as substitute in Premier League history than West Ham striker Javier Hernandez (17).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham and Burnley both face away matches next Saturday. The Hammers travel to Huddersfield, while the Clarets face Leicester City at King Power Stadium (both 15:00 GMT kick-offs)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool: We made life too easy for Gunners - Jurgen Klopp\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side made \"life a bit too easy\" for Arsenal to fight back for a hard-earned 1-1 draw in a thrilling encounter at Emirates Stadium.\nAlexandre Lacazette's late equaliser extended the Gunners' unbeaten run to 13 games.\nJames Milner's powerful strike just after the hour, drilled home after Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno's clearance rebounded off Rob Holding, looked to have put unbeaten Liverpool on course for victory.\nLacazette, however, had other ideas and drew the Gunners level eight minutes from time with a superb finish on the turn after he had taken the ball away from Liverpool keeper Alisson.\n\"It was very intense, Arsenal are in a very good moment,\" Klopp said.\n\"A point at Arsenal will always be a good result, so we take that and move on.\"\nThe point puts Liverpool back on top of the Premier League but they will feel hard done by after a first-half strike from Sadio Mane was incorrectly ruled out for offside, while Virgil van Dijk hit the post with a header and forced a fine save from Leno after the break.\n\"I think it was a goal, it should have been a goal,\" Klopp said.\n\"He runs to the ball because he doesn't think he is offside and then the referee whistles.\"\nArsenal's persistence deserved reward despite those escapes and their display confirmed their development under new manager Unai Emery.\nArsenal pass Liverpool test to suggest resurgence is no false dawn\nArsenal answer the questions\nDespite Arsenal's unbeaten run, questions remained unanswered about the new Emery regime, no matter how impressive their results since defeats in their opening Premier League games at home to Manchester City and away at Chelsea.\nIt was felt Liverpool's potent attack would provide their most severe test - and to come through against Jurgen Klopp's unbeaten side with a point will do wonders for belief and self-confidence.\nArsenal still have much to do to catch Liverpool but Emery's era is in its infancy and there was much to admire about the Gunners - even though they got lucky with the first-half offside call that saw Mane's goal ruled out for offside.\nThey showed real urgency in the first half to shade an enthralling first 45 minutes but arguably even more satisfying will be the manner in which they dug in to rescue a point after Milner put Liverpool ahead and Klopp's side looked in the mood to finish Arsenal off.\nArsenal, with Lucas Torreira a fine addition and Lacazette a force up front, stuck to their task and were rewarded with a point.\nThey remain a work in progress but in a match many felt would see the new Arsenal's flaws exposed, Emery and his players can regard this as a highly satisfactory result and performance.\nVan Dijk the tower of strength\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was prepared to play a game of patience to land Virgil van Dijk after his initial move to sign the Netherlands captain from Southampton in the summer of 2017 ended in acrimony.\nKlopp was not interested in any other target and as soon as the January transfer window opened Van Dijk was through the door at Anfield for \u00a375m, a world record fee for a defender.\nAnd with every passing game, Liverpool's lavish pay-out looks money well spent.\nVan Dijk was the focal point as Arsenal's first half excellence put Liverpool's defence to the test, demonstrating not only his aerial prowess but also his uncanny knack of making vital interceptions and deflections at the vital moment.\nHe was also a threat in the air, hitting the post with a header in the first half and bringing a fine save from Arsenal keeper Leno after the break.\nHe has solved an obvious area of vulnerability in Liverpool's team and gives them an added dimension. He will be a central figure in their Premier League title pursuit.\nEmirates Stadium alive again\nArsenal's home games in Arsene Wenger's final season were soulless and acrimonious in varying degrees - but not now, as the home fans relish the positive approach of Emery's side.\nWenger spoke of the stadium's \"negative environment\" in his latter days, as supporters who had lost faith in their long-serving manager, combined with Arsenal's failure to mount a serious Premier League title challenge, watched with mounting discontent.\nIt is clear that during the course of Arsenal's unbeaten 13-match run Emery has not only rekindled hope and optimism but restored some of the heart and soul to this vast arena.\nEmery's own urgency in the technical area transmits itself to the stands with, especially during the first half, a thunderous atmosphere in a place that seemed to have forgotten how to enjoy its football last season.\nArsenal's supporters gave their team a warm reception at the final whistle and will have seen enough to confirm that Emery is on the right lines after succeeding Wenger.\nMan of the match - Lucas Torreira (Arsenal)\n'Maybe we deserved more' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: \"A point is a good result - Unai Emery can say the same, but we had clear chances. When Arsenal chase the game they throw everyone on the pitch which is really cool and we were not as compact as I wanted.\n\"Our workhorses in midfield, we put too much on their shoulders. And it was one time we didn't close Alex Iwobi and he plays the pass for the goal.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery speaking to BT Sport: \"We wanted to win but the performance is good, we push and we work the match, doing our tactics and with our supporters pushing us with energy. For the supporters it is a great match and a good spectacle but I am only 50% happy because we wanted to win.\n\"Today the balance was good in our speed and intensity. We worked very well for the 90 minutes and the two goals is the difference in the match. This is a point and a draw, maybe we deserve a little more.\"\nGunners barren run against Liverpool continues - the stats\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their opening 11 matches to a Premier League campaign for the first time since the 2007-08 campaign.\nArsenal have won more points from losing positions than any other Premier League side in 2018-19 (8).\nArsenal are winless in their last seven Premier League meetings with Liverpool (D3 L4).\nArsenal have not led at half-time in any of their 11 Premier League matches so far this season. However, the Gunners have scored more goals after the break than any other side (19).\nLiverpool midfielder James Milner's opener was his 50th goal in the Premier League - 14 of them have been for Liverpool, more than any other side he has played for in the competition.\nMilner's strike was his first from open play in the Premier League since March 2016 v Man City - ending a run of eight successive goals from the penalty spot in the competition.\nFollowing Alex Iwobi's assist for their equaliser, Arsenal's subs have now been involved in 10 Premier League goals this season (6 goals, 4 assists), more than any other side.\n17 of Alexandre Lacazette's 23 goals for Arsenal in all competitions have been scored in home games.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Sporting Lisbon in the Europa League on Thursday (20:00 GMT), before playing Wolves at Emirates Stadium next Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nLiverpool travel to Serbia to face Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on Tuesday (17:55 GMT), before taking on Fulham in next Sunday's lunchtime kick-off (12:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham defender Juan Foyth produced a \"very good\" performance despite conceding two penalties on his Premier League debut against Wolves, said manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nSpurs were coasting after establishing a 3-0 lead, before Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez scored from the spot after two fouls by 20-year-old Foyth.\nIt made for an uncomfortable finish for Pochettino's side at Molineux, but they hung on to climb above north London rivals Arsenal into fourth place.\nPochettino refused to blame Foyth, who started in place of Davinson Sanchez.\nColombia defender Sanchez was rested before Tuesday's must-win Champions League Group B game with PSV Eindhoven at Wembley, but was sent on in the closing stages.\n\"These things happen,\" Pochettino told BBC Sport, when asked about Argentina Under-20 international Foyth's performance.\n\"He is so young, it's his first game in the Premier League. I think he played well. He always tried to play and was relaxed and calm. I think his performance was very good and I am happy with him.\"\nReaction from Molineux as Spurs go level with third-placed Chelsea\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nTottenham survive stirring Wolves fightback\nThis was Tottenham's fifth fixture in 15 days, and for over an hour there appeared to be little sign of fatigue from Pochettino's side as they overcame the early loss of Mousa Dembele to injury to sail into a commanding lead.\nBelgium midfielder Dembele's 250th Spurs appearance lasted a little over one minute before he suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury after Helder Costa fell into him following a challenge by Ben Davies.\nSpurs were already without Dele Alli - one of several players rested before PSV Eindhoven's visit.\nHowever, there was a real menace about the visitors as Harry Kane forced a decent save from Rui Patricio before unmarked Argentine midfielder Erik Lamela opened the scoring after finding space inside the penalty area and firing through the legs of the Wolves keeper.\nTwo minutes and 54 seconds later it was 2-0, Lucas Moura left unmarked to head home Kieran Trippier's delicious cross before Kane struck from inside the six-yard area for his first league goal in five weeks.\nBut Foyth's late mistakes made for an unnecessarily nervy finish.\nFirst he clearly fouled Jimenez before pushing Wolves defender Jonny 10 minutes later, becoming the first player to give away two penalties in the same Premier League game since Phil Jagielka in 2016.\nHugo Lloris dived the wrong way for both penalties but Tottenham held on to secure a sixth top-flight win in seven attempts away from Wembley.\nPositives in defeat for Wolves\nWolves have settled quickly into life in the Premier League following promotion. But having gone on a six-match unbeaten run, they have now lost to Watford, Brighton and Tottenham.\nIt does not get any easier for Nuno Espirito Santo's side, with a visit to Arsenal - unbeaten in 14 league and cup games - up next.\nDespite a second successive Molineux defeat, there were positives.\nWolves showed in their battling second-half performance that they have character, and they have every right to feel aggrieved at the officials after Jimenez's celebrations in the 37th minute was wrongly cut short by an offside flag.\n\"It could have made a big difference. It's hard not to feel a little bit unfairly done by,\" said Wolves' Portuguese boss.\nJimenez, Willy Boly and Neves all went close in a three-minute spell at the start of the second-half - Lloris producing a stunning stop to keep out the latter.\nHowever, Wolves' marking - particularly for the first two Spurs goals - was naive and it will have to improve if they are to stay away from the relegation zone.\nThey have already proved they can hold their own against the heavyweights of the division by holding both Manchester City and Manchester United to 1-1 draws.\nWith matches against Arsenal (away), Chelsea (home) and Liverpool (home) coming up in the next few weeks, Wolves cannot afford to gift the opposition three-goal starts.\n\"It was a disappointing result, but a fantastic reaction in the second half. Tottenham counter-attacked twice and that defined the game,\" added Nuno.\n\"We had the character to go back in the game when everybody thought the game was lost. The boys gave everything, took risks. We had chances. Maybe we would have deserved a draw.\"\nMan of the match - Erik Lamela (Tottenham)\nWhy Wolves struggle against sides in the top half of the table\nWolves have won none of their past 25 Premier League matches against sides starting the day in the top half of the table (D10 L15).\nTottenham have won 24 points from their 11 Premier League games this season, only in 2011-12 (25) have they picked up more at this stage of a single campaign in the competition.\nWolves midfielder Ruben Neves' penalty goal was his first league goal scored inside the box in English football, with his previous seven coming outside the box.\nSpurs have only lost two of their last 17 away games in the Premier League, winning each of the last four in a row.\nTottenham are unbeaten in their last 39 Premier League games against promoted sides (W36 D3).\nTottenham forward Harry Kane has scored 27 goals in his last 27 away Premier League games.\nKane has scored against 27 of the 28 teams that he has faced in the Premier League, with the only exception being Cardiff City.\nWhat's next?\nAnother stern test awaits Wolves when they travel to face Arsenal at the Emirates next Sunday (16:30 GMT). Tottenham are back in action on Tuesday when they host PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League Group B game at Wembley (20:00 GMT)"

        "article_text": "Man City 6-1 Southampton: Blues cruise to comfortable win\nManchester City cruised to victory over a sorry Southampton side to return to the top of the Premier League.\nCity took just six minutes to open the scoring as Wesley Hoedt smashed an attempted clearance of Leroy Sane's cross into his own net, before Sergio Aguero doubled their lead by tapping in Raheem Sterling's cross.\nDavid Silva slammed home their third from Sane's flick-on after 18 minutes but Danny Ings did pull one back from the spot after Ederson brought him down in the area.\nSterling then netted either side of the break to complete an impressive personal performance, while Sane added a late sixth to cap off a fine afternoon for Pep Guardiola's men.\nSterling is no longer scared, says Guardiola\nWho infuriated Garth Crooks but still made his team of the week?\nBoth of the England forward's goals were assisted by Aguero, as the Argentine first crossed for Sterling to stroke in, before a slide-rule pass enabled the 23-year-old to finish emphatically.\nSane's goal came deep into injury time, firing past Alex McCarthy following a lightning counter-attack with Southampton legs tiring.\nGuardiola's side have now won eight of their past nine matches across all competitions, although Ings' penalty was the first league goal they have conceded in six games.\nLiverpool had moved above City after their draw with Arsenal on Saturday evening but the Reds held on to top spot for less than 24 hours.\nMeanwhile, Saints are now seven Premier League games without a victory and lie 16th.\nFree-scoring City\nCity's thumping win marked the 12th time that Guardiola's side have scored five or more goals in a single Premier League game since the Spaniard arrived at the club - no other team has done so on more than six occasions in the same timeframe.\nAnd they threatened from the off, as Southampton had already been warned of their hosts' attacking quality several times, before Hoedt's attempted clearance ended up in his own net.\nAguero had already spurned one good chance before he turned in Sterling's cross for his 150th Premier League goal, after the England forward and Bernardo Silva linked up classily.\nDavid Silva then added his side's third in the 18th minute, his powerful volley from Sane's flick-on leaving McCarthy helpless, but before then the Blues had seen a number of dangerous attacks break down.\nThe home side eased off after this early blitz, which saw them enjoy 81% of the possession in the opening 20 minutes, with a fifth straight league win over Southampton already in the bag.\nLivewire Sterling shows his class\nIngs' penalty seemed to reignite the hosts' appetite for goals, as City began to push again, in large through the excellent Sterling.\nAnd it was the ex-Liverpool winger who netted their fourth, stroking in at the second attempt, after initially miss-controlling Aguero's pass.\nAfter being heavily involved in all three of their opening goals, Sterling's effort was richly deserved.\nThe England man was lively throughout, and although he could have done better with several half-chances, he illustrated his clinical side by powering in his 50th goal for the club on 67 minutes.\nHaving earlier set up Aguero's tap-in, Sterling again turned provider late on, as it was from his pass that Sane netted City's sixth.\nThe German's strike took his club's goal tally to 33 after the opening 11 Premier League games, meaning they are well on their way to matching last season's record-breaking tally of 106, although they had already netted 38 by this stage in 2017-18.\nSaints blown away\nFew would have given Saints much of a chance coming into this match, given the fact they were winless in their last eight visits to the Etihad prior to Sunday, and that proved to be the case.\nGuardiola's side were ruthless, punishing nearly every goalscoring opportunity in the opening stages.\nAnd although Ings' fifth goal of the season did provide them with a potential way back into the game, they never looked like producing any sort of comeback.\nChances were few and far between for Mark Hughes' side, although Ings did draw a good save from Ederson after the Brazilian had fumbled a powerful James Ward-Prowse strike.\nAnd City's goalkeeper also had to be alert shortly after, getting down low to keep out Ings' near-post header.\nBut they failed to mount a sustained period of pressure, and it was the home side that looked more likely to score throughout the second half, as the Saints' search for a second Premier League victory of the season goes on.\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling\n'We were brilliant' - what they said\nManchester City forward Raheem Sterling, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I thought it was a great team performance, not just with the ball. We were brilliant at times today. I am grateful for the position I am in, learning and trying to get better. It is great times at the moment.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We played excellently, without and especially with the ball. We were aggressive in the final third, but we were lucky to score the goal in the last minute of the first half. The game was not over, because we concede. Southampton created more chances than most teams this season.\"\nSouthampton boss Mark Hughes, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We were poor in that opening period, you have to be resolute to keep back an outstanding City team. We were a bit lightweight and didn't deal with one-on-one situations. Very quickly we found ourselves 3-0 down and the game was gone.\"\nCity the traditionalists - the stats\nManchester City are unbeaten in their past 43 Premier League games when kicking off at 3pm (W37 D6), the longest run at this specific time kick-off in the league's history.\nSouthampton are winless in nine games at the Etihad Stadium (D1 L8) since winning their very first game there in April 2004.\nDanny Ings' penalty for Southampton was their first goal in 505 minutes of Premier League football, and ended Manchester City's run of 630 minutes without conceding a goal in the competition.\nSergio Aguero scored his 150th Premier League goal in his 217th appearance - only Alan Shearer (212 games) has scored 150 in fewer games in Premier League history.\nWesley Hoedt has now scored two own goals in this season's Premier League, more than any other player in the division.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City are back in action on Wednesday when they host Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League (20:00 GMT), before they take on Manchester United on Remembrance Sunday (11 November, 16:30).\nMeanwhile, Southampton face Watford at St Mary's on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-1 Crystal Palace\nChelsea striker Alvaro Morata is \"fragile\" and \"needs to improve\" despite scoring two goals in the win against Crystal Palace, says Blues boss Maurizio Sarri.\nThe Spain international inspired the hosts to a victory which took them above Liverpool and into second place in the Premier League.\nMorata has netted 14 times in 40 league appearances since joining from Real Madrid for a then club record \u00a360m in July 2017.\nAsked after the match whether Morata can be the main striker at Stamford Bridge, Sarri told BBC Sport: \"I don't know. I think potentially he can.\n\"He has to improve more in personality and in confidence - because sometimes he's a little bit fragile.\"\nWhy Morata is the top striker Chelsea need - Gullit analysis\nWho infuriated Garth Crooks but still made his team of the week?\nReaction from Stamford Bridge as Chelsea go second\nHazard makes impact on return\nThe headlines will be about Morata - and the former Real Madrid and Juventus forward has now scored five Premier League goals, plus another in the Europa League, this season.\nYet the return of Eden Hazard added much needed energy and flair to a team that had struggled to open up Palace for the first hour.\nHaving missed the previous three league and cup games with a back injury, the Belgium international did not take long to make an impact after replacing Willian in the 64th minute with the score locked at 1-1.\nNinety-one seconds after his introduction, Chelsea were back in the lead after Palace's defence failed to deal with Hazard's free-kick into box, allowing Morata to drill home.\nAnd five minutes later it was 3-1. Pedro - who had delivered the pass for Morata to break the deadlock in the first half - produced an unstoppable finish from Marcos Alonso's low cross.\n\"We were in a little bit of trouble so we needed some quality, some personality,\" added Sarri. \"We were lucky today because Eden was on the bench so he was able immediately to change the match.\"\nSince arriving in the summer of 2017, Morata has struggled to convince his critics he is a consistent goal source for Chelsea.\nYet his performance against Palace could well win him a few more admirers - even though he missed a chance to complete his hat-trick in the closing stages after being sent clean through by Hazard.\nWill Palace stay out of danger?\nAndros Townsend's lovely equaliser after James McArthur sent him clear raised hopes Palace could leave Stamford Bridge with a potentially vital point.\nInstead, they are without a win in six league matches and must plan for their next game at home to Tottenham on the back of a fourth defeat in five top-flight games.\nAfter Spurs next Saturday, Palace's first game after the international break is at Manchester United on 24 November.\nHaving been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Championship side Middlesbrough in midweek, Palace started well against Chelsea.\nWith Wilfried Zaha causing problems at one end of the pitch and Mamadou Sakho strong at the other, Chelsea became frustrated until Morata scored with their first shot on target.\nChelsea have managed just two clean sheets in nine league and cup home games this season and Townsend's quality finish against the run of play - only Palace's eighth top-flight goal of the campaign - left them in sight of a first away point since 15 September.\nInstead, Palace have now lost four in a row away from home and problems appear to be mounting for manager Roy Hodgson.\n\"The season has got a lot of football left in it and there's many more games to play,\" he said.\n\"I'm fairly confident with the players we have and the way we play that results will come. If you continue to perform at the right level the results have got to follow.\"\nMan of the match - Alvaro Morata\nGood omen? The stats\nChelsea are undefeated in their opening 11 Premier League matches of this season - they won the league in the previous two seasons they achieved this (2005-06 and 2014-15).\nBlues boss Maurizio Sarri is unbeaten in his first 11 Premier League games as Chelsea manager - this is the joint-longest unbeaten start by a manager new to the competition, equalling the record set by Frank Clark in 1994.\nCrystal Palace have taken just five points from their past 10 league matches.\nChelsea striker Alvaro Morata has scored four goals in his past four Premier League games - one more than in his previous 23 appearances in the competition combined (3).\nChelsea's Eden Hazard has assisted in three consecutive league appearances as a substitute.\nCrystal Palace's Andros Townsend has scored three Premier League goals against Chelsea - more than he has against any other opponent.\nChelsea's Pedro has ended on the winning side in 39 of the 40 top-flight home matches he has scored in during his career (26 of 27 with Barcelona, 13 of 13 with Chelsea), drawing the other with Villarreal in January 2010.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea are on their Europa League travels to Belarus to face Bate Borisov on Thursday (17:55 GMT) while Palace face another tough match at home to Tottenham in the league next Saturday (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield 1-0 Fulham: Fosu-Mensah own goal ends home side's scoring drought\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner says the win over Fulham - the club's first of this Premier League season - is one of the most important they have achieved during his three years at the club.\nTimothy Fosu-Mensah's headed own goal was Town's first at home this season and lifted them off the bottom of the table at their opponents' expense.\nIt had been 659 minutes since Huddersfield found the net on home soil - through Tom Ince's injury-time winner against Watford on 14 April - and it was reward for a performance that showcased energy and endeavour in the first half and discipline and commitment in the second.\n\"This is huge for us,\" said Wagner, who was celebrating the third anniversary of his appointment as head coach. \"We have the winning feeling back. For sure it is one of the most important wins we've had in the past three years. Everybody needed this belief back. It's massive for us.\n\"Nothing is more important than this winning feeling, having happy faces in the dressing room and in the club. We are back in the race after 11 games.\n\"When you look at the fixtures in front of us, they are teams in and around the area where they'll be open games. Today I think we were the team who really wanted this win.\"\nFulham weren't in the game before the break and while they improved after that, they have now equalled a Premier League record by conceding 29 goals in their opening 11 games.\nMonday's defeat was the Cottagers' fifth in a row and exacerbates what has already been their worst ever start to a top-flight season.\nThis is represented in their new league position, which sees them level on five points with Cardiff and 20th courtesy of the league's worst goal difference.\nHuddersfield remain in the bottom three and are just a point and two places above Fulham, but will be buoyed by their superiority over a relegation rival and a first victory in 15 top-flight matches.\nRelive Huddersfield's win over Fulham\nTown off the mark\nHuddersfield set the tone for the evening in the early stages, dominating possession, pressing high and snapping into tackles to win the ball back whenever Fulham threatened to counter.\nIt quickly became clear that this was a fragile Fulham side, stripped of confidence and there for the taking, which the Terriers almost did when the tireless Jonathan Hogg dispossessed Aleksandar Mitrovic in midfield to set up Philip Billing for a 30-yard drive that struck the crossbar.\nUndeterred, the Terriers stuck to their positive game plan and were rewarded when Fosu-Mensah beat Schindler to the ball but succeeded only in heading it in just before the half-hour mark.\nTown were facing the prospect of becoming only the second side in English Football League history to fail to score in their first six home games of a season, joining Mansfield who failed to score in their first nine in the third tier in 1971-72.\nIt was a good time, then, to face the top division's weakest defence.\nThe home side were understandably less forward-thinking as the second half wore on, focusing all their efforts into a defensive display that helped them manage and see the game out without conceding.\n\"I don't care who scored it or how we performed,\" added Wagner. \"People know we can perform better. The pressure was on for both teams but how we fought... we left everything on the grass.\n\"It was deserved. In the first half, we were clear, and in the second half we were able to keep them away from our goal.\"\nFulham's defensive woes continue\nWhere do Fulham go from here?\nHaving spent \u00a3100m in the summer following promotion, they have acquired the necessary forward talent to help them stay up - not that they should much evidence of it here.\nThey did have the ball in the net in the second half, but Andre Schurrle's finish was ruled out as a result of Mitrovic straying unnecessarily offside.\nAnd the German wasted a subsequent opportunity with a poor finish after he had broken clear down the left and had team-mates better placed to score.\nHowever, such attacking errors pale in comparison to their inability to prevent goals going in at the other end, even against the division's bluntest attack.\nIt doesn't help that manager Slavisa Jokanovic still appears unsure of his best combination at the back, with Maxime le Marchand partnering Dennis Odoi in the manager's latest vain search for a clean sheet.\nTheir concession of 29 goals in their first 11 games means they emulate the unwanted defensive record set by Southampton in 2012-13. The Saints would go on to finish 14th that season but, on the evidence of this performance, such a recovery looks beyond the Cottagers.\n\"We're disappointed we didn't play well enough or show enough intensity, especially in the first 45 minutes,\" said Jokanovic. \"We found some improvement but it wasn't enough to equalise.\n\"They must fight - this is a tough competition. There are 27 games ahead of us. We didn't show a positive reaction and we must be brave and look for improvement. At the moment it is not enough at this level.\"\nAsked if he was concerned about his own position, Jokanovic said: \"This is my job, that is it. I know in this kind of situation many things can happen but it is outside of my control.\n\"I will follow my plan and work with the team. I must find the solution. Other people, if they need to say something, they can use some words.\"\nMan of the match - Jonathan Hogg (Huddersfield)\nTerriers finally join the party - the stats you need to know\nHuddersfield ended a run of 14 Premier League games without a win (D5 L9).\nThey are the final side in the top four tiers of English football to register a league victory this season.\nFulham are the only Premier League side yet to keep a clean sheet in the competition this season, last registering a top-flight shut-out in April 2014 (1-0 at home to Norwich).\nSince the start of last season, only Manchester City, Tottenham and Leicester (five each) have benefited from more opposition own goals in the Premier League than Huddersfield (four).\nWhat next?\nHuddersfield are at home again on Saturday when they host West Ham (15:00 GMT). Fulham remain on the road with a tough fixture at unbeaten Liverpool on Sunday (12:00)."

Contact was minimal, but the velocity of the tackle prompted Martin Atkinson to show a straight red card.\nBrighton then battled to hold on as Victor Camarasa twice tested Mat Ryan, and it appeared the Bluebirds would be denied before their dramatic winner in the last minute of normal time.\nBamba, created chaos in the penalty area with a bicycle kick that struck the post, with Ryan brilliantly tipping Paterson's rebound onto the crossbar.\nHowever, Bamba reacted quickest, blasting home to earn Cardiff a vital win.\nMan of the match - Kadeem Harris\nDunk head above the rest\nBrighton have won just one of their past 20 Premier League matches away from home (D5 L14), with that victory coming against Newcastle in October.\nCardiff have conceded the first goal of the game on more occasions than any other team in the Premier League this season (nine).\nEleven of Lewis Dunk's 13 league goals for Brighton have been headers.\nCardiff's Callum Paterson has scored three goals in his past four league appearances, after netting in just one of his previous 14.\nNeil Warnock took charge of his 100th match as Cardiff City boss (W46 D21 L33), with his side beating Brighton for the first time in three attempts during his reign at the club (W1 D1 L1)\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Cardiff travel to Everton before hosting Wolves.

He showed what he can do and is giving us something different.\"\nCherries struggle as Smith suffers \"serious\" injury\nDefeat condemned Bournemouth to consecutive league defeats for the first time since April, though they remain a creditable sixth in the league.\nEddie Howe, the Premier League's manager of the month for October, had described Marcus Rashford's late winner for Manchester United last weekend as \"a tough one\" - but the Cherries were slow to start on this occasion, despite their good form.\nThat was largely due to Newcastle's disruptive play, however they did create the game's first opportunity as Federico Fernandez was forced to produce a last-gasp block to deny Ibe.\nThe opening goal filled the hosts with a confidence that Howe's side struggled to contain, before Adam Smith's injury halted the Cherries as they looked to be growing into the contest.\nSmith appeared to injure his knee as he stuttered in his run-up to take a free-kick, and received oxygen before being stretchered off after a lengthy delay.\nLerma - also replaced due to injury - offered a lifeline to the visitors to set up a delicately poised second half, but Ibe squandered his side's best opportunity to rescue a point in a game where Callum Wilson, fresh from his first senior international call-up, was often left isolated.\nThe Cherries thought they had found a late equaliser but Dan Gosling was correctly flagged for offside after bundling in David Brooks' effort as Newcastle resisted the visitors' late pressure.\nHowe's side embark on a tough run once the Premier League resumes, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool all to come within their next four fixtures.\n\"Adam Smith looks like he's got a knee injury, it looks quite serious. It did disrupt the flow of the game - the long delay - and obviously the players were concerned so that didn't help,\" said Howe.\n\"I was pleased with aspects of the second half, we were on the front foot more and we had the ball in some dangerous areas. We will use this time to assess the injuries and come back fresh. You are judged game by game and today was a disappointment.\"\nMan of the match - Salomon Rondon (Newcastle)\nRondon puts an end to drought - the stats\nNewcastle have won consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April - when they went on to win four in a row.\nMagpies striker Rondon scored his first Premier League goal in 10 appearances, since netting versus Liverpool in April.\nRondon has scored more than once in a Premier League game for just the second time - also scoring three against Swansea in December 2016.\nBournemouth lost their first away game in all competitions against Newcastle since February 1990.\nThe Cherries have lost their last two Premier League games, despite losing just two of their previous 12.\nBournemouth's Jefferson Lerma scored for the first time in 57 appearances in Europe's big five leagues, since netting for Levante against Espanyol in La Liga in December 2015.\nWhat's next?\nOnce the international break concludes, Bournemouth host Arsenal on Sunday, 25 November (13:30 GMT) while Newcastle travel to face Burnley a day later (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield 1-1 West Ham: Anderson denies Town a second win in a week\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner felt his side \"had no luck\" as West Ham's Felipe Anderson scored a late equaliser to prevent the Terriers claiming their second win in six days.\nStill buoyant from Monday's victory over Fulham, Wagner's men started brightly and Alex Pritchard opened the scoring with just their second goal at home this season - and the first scored by a Huddersfield player.\nThe hosts hit the woodwork twice and Wagner believed they should have had a penalty for a foul on defender Mathias Jorgensen, nicknamed Zanka, before the break.\nThe Huddersfield boss said: \"We hit the post and bar again, and we had another big decision against us when Zanka got fouled. It was a penalty from my point of view and, again, we had no luck in the game.\"\nBut West Ham had the better of the second half and although Anderson drew the Hammers level, they were unable to follow up last week's win over Burnley with another victory.\nThe Hammers remain 13th in the Premier League after missing the chance to gain back-to-back league wins for the first time since January 2017, while Huddersfield are second-bottom after Cardiff's win over Brighton earlier.\nThe Terriers will now be without Chris Lowe for several weeks as the German midfielder was carried off after an injury late in the first half.\nWagner added: \"He looks to have a shoulder ligament injury. We need to see if he needs surgery, but he will miss a few weeks now for sure.\"\nTerriers show stomach for a fight\nIt took six games for Huddersfield to score at home this season but the Terriers carried that momentum from Monday into Saturday's game.\nThey won a second-minute corner from which Steve Mounie headed Aaron Mooy's delivery goalwards, only to see Lukasz Fabianski tip it against the crossbar.\nWest Ham then gave the ball away in their own half and Pritchard played a one-two with Jonathan Hogg before dragging a left-footed shot towards goal, but it had enough power to creep into the bottom corner.\nThe Terriers deserved their half-time lead and they could have been more comfortable as Philip Billing's left-wing cross drifted over Fabianski and hit the inside of the far post before bouncing on the goalline.\nMounie was again denied by Fabianski after being put clean through by Pritchard, and in the second half Huddersfield had to rely on the defensive resolve that served them so well last term.\nAnderson may have struck eventually, denying the Terriers their first back-to-back league wins since February, but four points in a week has more than doubled their tally.\nHammers consistently inconsistent\nIn this fixture last season, West Ham showed just what they are capable of by cruising to a 4-1 victory and, after Manuel Pellegrini's appointment in the summer, they have displayed their potential again with wins over Everton and Manchester United before brushing aside Burnley last week.\nBut Pellegrini's biggest challenge is getting that level of performance out of his side on a regular basis - and for 90 minutes - as it needed a much-improved second-half showing to secure a draw.\nA lively start could have seen the Hammers strike as a break resulted in Marko Arnautovic forcing home goalkeeper Jonas Lossl to turn his shot wide.\nBut moments later Anderson's pass put Declan Rice under pressure and Huddersfield pounced to take full advantage, and more loose play by the visitors in their own half handed Mounie his second chance of the game.\nIn last season's trip here, West Ham scored three goals in 16 minutes at the start of the second half and they almost struck just after the restart again as Javier Hernandez, who replaced Grady Diangana at half-time, had a close-range shot blocked by Lossl before heading the rebound over.\nPedro Obiang had glancing a header wide from a Robert Snodgrass corner before Anderson burst down the left wing and passed for Snodgrass to cross into the box.\nThe Hammers had two shots blocked before Anderson, who by now had drifted into the box, swept in his third goal in two games from 12 yards, and they nearly won it as Issa Diop had a header cleared off the line by Mooy from a Snodgrass corner.\n'I really can see the positives' - what they said\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner said: \"The frustration is there, after the first half when we were very strong. In the second half I have to be honest, West Ham had opportunities as well. But in the last five minutes we were the team that wanted to push for the win.\n\"The good thing is four points in a week. I really can see the positives. We'll take this result even if I think we deserved more.\"\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini said: \"We didn't play well in the first half after their goal. You have to fight for every ball when you come here, they play with a great intensity and aggression. We also kept the ball too much in our own half, this is a team that aggressively presses you.\n\"In second half we improved a little bit more, we created chances and we got the goal. But if you review the 90 minutes, the draw was the result that both teams deserved.\"\nMan of the match - Philip Billing (Huddersfield)\nMatch stats - Hogg's overdue assist\nHuddersfield haven't scored more than once in any of their past 22 Premier League games, netting just nine goals in total in that run.\nSix of West Ham's seven Premier League goals against Huddersfield have been scored in the second half.\nWest Ham have kept just one clean sheet in their past 15 Premier League away games, a 2-0 win at Leicester in May.\nHuddersfield's Jonathan Hogg registered his first league assist in 112 appearances, since setting up goals for Huddersfield against Bolton in the Championship in December 2014."

As it is, they are still waiting for their first home win of the season.\nThe referee incorrectly believed Austin's shot had gone in off team-mate Maya Yoshida, who was in an offside position.\nWatford, meanwhile, climbed to seventh in the Premier League thanks to the point gained when Jose Holebas' equaliser deflected in off home defender Cedric Soares late on.\n\"The performance of the referee is not good enough,\" the Southampton boss said afterwards.\n\"All we want in a game is the key match-defining moments to be correct. At 2-0 the game is over. It is unfortunate and a bad mistake. He admitted it on the pitch. I mean for goodness sake, he needed a bit of help. These decisions affect what we are trying to do here.\"\nAustin said: \"It's ridiculous, they shouldn't be in the game. We scored a perfectly good goal that was ruled out for offside. The officials cost us two points.\"\nSouthampton's failure to cling on to their lead leaves them hovering just above the relegation zone in 17th.\nIt also ensured an unwanted record of failing to win any of their first six homes games in a season for the first time in their history.\nFour of those fixtures have ended in draws, but their inability to convert promising situations into three points is likely to increase the pressure on Hughes, with reports\n, external\nsuggesting his job is on the line.\nDespite Watford enjoying some good fortune to equalise, manager Javi Gracia also felt aggrieved not to be awarded a penalty when Ryan Bertrand appeared to foul Nathaniel Chalobah.\n\"There were different situations that were difficult for the referee but it was a clear penalty,\" he said.\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nRelive Southampton's draw with Watford\nHughes remains under pressure\nHughes, who has now recorded just three victories in 20 league matches as Southampton manager, will be aware of the background noise questioning his position.\nHowever, he has pointed to his \"limited\" input in recruitment.\nThe departures of technical director Martin Hunter and vice-chairman Les Reed on Thursday represented an acknowledgement of the club's recent struggles in this area.\nPremier League finishes of eighth, seventh, sixth and eighth were largely constructed upon the club's resourcefulness in the transfer market and the integration of those players into a clear football philosophy that allied neat passing with high pressing.\nBut replacing the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Victor Wanyama, Dusan Tadic and Sadio Mane and expecting the same results and style of play is a difficult proposition.\nAt St Mary's on Saturday, Southampton's fluency was largely sparked by Stuart Armstrong, starting only his second game since his \u00a37m move from Celtic in the summer.\nThe Scotland winger linked well with Ryan Bertrand and Italian forward Gabbiadini, and covered the most ground of any player in the first half.\nAs he tired his influence waned, but Hughes must hope for more from Armstrong and Gabbiadini - who scored his first Premier League goal at home for over a year - to spark a revival over the coming weeks.\nWatford show their grit\nIf recent reversals against Newcastle and Bournemouth had suggested a side with a soft underbelly, Watford dispelled doubts over their character on the south coast.\nWhile not at their best, they delivered a performance brimming with grit which was helped by the introduction of Troy Deeney just before the break.\nThe forward was instrumental in the build-up to Chalobah's penalty claim and added physicality to the Hornets attack which at times panicked the home defence.\nAlex McCarthy's late attempt to punch clear was one such example with the ball ricocheting back against the Southampton crossbar as Yoshida and Watford's Isaac Success jumped for the ball.\n\"I think our idea was to get a win, but in the first half we started losing,\" said Gracia.\n\"In the second we showed character and ambition and were improving. Maybe we could win in the last part of the game but Southampton created good chances. It was fair in the end.\"\nIn contrast to Hughes, Gracia is being talked about as a long-term managerial solution at Vicarage Road and is expected to sign a new three-year deal at the club.\nThe 48-year-old Spaniard is the 10th Hornets boss since the Pozzo family took charge of the club in 2012 and would be the first to sign a contract extension in their ownership.\nMan of the match - Mario Lemina\nHolebas the attacking defender - the stats\nSouthampton have lost just one of their past 11 matches against Watford in all competitions (W5 D5).\nWatford have failed to keep a clean sheet in 11 of their past 12 Premier League away games.\nWatford's Jose Holebas has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season than any other defender (two goals, four assists).\nSouthampton's Manolo Gabbiadini scored his first Premier League goal at St Mary's stadium since October 2017 v Newcastle, 391 days ago.\nSouthampton's opening goal was their first in the Premier League that wasn't from the penalty spot in 615 minutes since Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg netted v Brighton in September.\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Southampton travel to Fulham in the Premier League on Saturday, 24 November (15:00 GMT) while Watford host Liverpool on the same day (15:00 GMT)"

        "article_text": "Leicester City held to a goalless draw by Burnley\nLeicester City's emotional return to the King Power Stadium for the first time since the death of owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in a helicopter crash outside the stadium ended in a 0-0 draw with Burnley.\nIt was a poignant occasion - sad, yet commemorating the man whose vision inspired Leicester's unlikely Premier League title win in 2015-16.\nBoth sides' fans delivered a fitting tribute to his memory and the four others who died after the game with West Ham two weeks ago.\nSupporters, led by squad members such as Harry Maguire and James Maddison, steered a tribute march from the city centre to the stadium while the pitch was framed by hundreds of Leicester City shirts, flags and banners.\nThere was a two-minute silence before kick-off with Vichai's son Aiyawatt in attendance and wreaths laid for both his father and the forthcoming Remembrance Sunday.\nIt was no surprise that Leicester started brightly then faded after the emotional and physical exertions of the past two weeks, which included a 12,000-mile round trip to pay their respects at the former owner's funeral in Bangkok.\nLeicester had the best of the first half, with Jamie Vardy's shot cleared off the line by Matt Lowton, Rachid Ghezzal heading against the bar and Joe Hart saving at the feet of Demarai Gray.\nBurnley grew into the game and will be satisfied with a point, although Chris Wood should have done better than lift a second-half chance over the top.\nOn this day, for once, the result was arguably secondary to the occasion - this was a day to remember the Thai businessman whose ambition and investment allowed Leicester City and their fans to live the dream.\nLeicester City honour 'The Boss' with dignity\nThis was a day of raw emotion, not just at the King Power Stadium, but in the city of Leicester and the memory of beloved owner Srivaddhanaprabha was honoured with dignity and class.\nFrom the moment thousands joined the '5,000-1' march, named after The Foxes' odds at the start of the 2015-16 season when they won they Premier League title, to the pre-match tributes, this was an occasion befitting the man simply known as 'The Boss'.\nClaudio Ranieri, the manager who brought the title to Leicester, was in attendance and received a rapturous reception, along with his predecessor Nigel Pearson and successor Craig Shakespeare.\nThe man who built the modern Leicester was also honoured with a standing ovation and applause - with the scarves left on every seat held aloft - in the 60th minute, a time chosen as he was 60 at the time of his death.\nSupporters gathered around the stadium hours before kick-off, their numbers swelling when the marchers arrived, and there were many tears during a video looking back on Vichai's time at the club and ambassador Alan Birchenall's tribute speech.\nAnd there were even more tears after the final whistle when Leicester's players stayed on the pitch to be joined by Srivaddhanaprabha's son Aiyawatt as well as Ranieri, Pearson and Shakespeare besides two other vital components of that landmark title-wining campaign - former director of football Steve Walsh and defender Robert Huth. Former Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, a hugely popular figure, was another paying his own tribute.\nIt was a gesture of thanks for the comfort the supporters have given him and his family - and also a real show of unity for players, staff, fans and all who played their part in this remarkable story.\nBurnley play their part\nBurnley's supporters played their own part in the pre-game tributes - and when the action started, in a football context, they will be pleased with the outcome.\nAfter conceding 13 goals in their last three Premier League games, manager Sean Dyche knew he had to stop the rot - although it did not look likely as Burnley were fortunate to come through a wretched first 30 minutes when Leicester dominated but could not make their supremacy count.\nAs Leicester tired, the emotion not just of this day but the last fortnight making its impact, Burnley started to look more composed and came through the second half with relatively few scares, even creating the odd opening for themselves with Chris Wood squandering the best chance.\nThis was a tough day for Leicester, the city and the football club. It was, in some respects, a difficult day for Burnley too and Dyche will be pleased with a point.\nWhat they said after 'emotionally draining' week\nLeicester City's Marc Albrighton:\n\"This week has been hard. We went to Thailand and paid our respects to Vichai and his family. It is something we felt we wanted to do. It is a tough time for everyone but everyone has done their part. Every single person at this club has stuck together.\n\"It's extraordinary the way the fans have come together. Leicester fans have been brilliant for us and we need them. It's going to be a tough road. The lads are emotionally drained. Today was one of the hardest games I have ever played.\"\nFoxes boss Claude Puel:\n\"We were unlucky but I was proud of the players' performance because they gave their best in this situation.\n\"It was a tough week to prepare this game without training sessions and a long journey to Bangkok. The players compensated with desire. I would like to congratulate the players because it was difficult. I hope we can continue this response to honour our chairman.\"\nSome post-match stats:\nLeicester hit 22 shots in the game - the most they have attempted in a Premier League game without scoring since they returned to the top flight in 2014-15.\nBurnley have failed to score in a joint-league-high six Premier League games this season.\nClarets boss Sean Dyche has never won a league match at the King Power Stadium (W0 D3 L3).\nBurnley registered their first clean sheet in six Premier League games.\nLeicester failed to score in a Premier League game this season for the first time, with every side now failing to score in at least one top-flight game this season.\nWhat next?\nAfter an international break, Leicester are away to Brighton while Burnley host Newcastle."

To improve, you have to make mistakes and that is going to help him.\n\"He has so much potential and only needs time and games to improve. After last week we said 'you need to forget that situation' because it has happened and it can happen to footballers.\n\"His performance today was fantastic. He played so well. He needs to learn and keep improving but he is a very good prospect for us.\"\nPalace have now failed to win in seven games in all competitions and were left rueing James Tomkins' failure to hit the target with a free header when it was goalless.\nThe hosts pushed for an equaliser late on, but Spurs captain Hugo Lloris did well to deny Jeffrey Schlupp, ex-Tottenham man Andros Townsend and substitute Alexander Sorloth as the visitors held on.\nThe result leaves the Eagles 16th, only out of the relegation zone on goal difference, while fourth-placed Tottenham are two points behind leaders Manchester City, although the top three are all in action on Sunday.\nIt was not all good news for Tottenham, however, as England international Kieran Trippier, who on Thursday was named in Gareth Southgate's squad for the friendly against the United States and the Nations League game versus Croatia, limped out of the game after only 22 minutes.\nMidfielder Erik Lamela also had to leave the field when he suffered a badly cut head as he slid in to challenge Schlupp.\nFrom villain to hero\nFoyth, who joined Tottenham from Argentine club Estudiantes in August 2017 in an \u00a38m transfer, had only played in cup games before making his poor league debut at Molineux last weekend.\nHe was not in the 18-man matchday squad for Spurs' 2-1 win over PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Tuesday, but a hamstring injury to Davinson Sanchez gave Foyth another chance.\nHe made a nervous start when he needlessly conceded a corner under no pressure with a misplaced pass to Lloris, although Palace could not capitalise from the set-piece.\nBut he became the match winner in the second half, reacting quickest as Palace failed to attack the second ball after Harry Kane's header had deflected into Foyth's range.\nTottenham had 65% of the possession and had the best chances in the first half, but Dele Alli headed wide when unmarked, Kane had a 25-yard shot pushed away and Lucas Moura headed over.\nAfter the game, Foyth admitted he had learned a lot from his mistakes against Wolves.\n\"I think the two penalties I conceded against Wolves, I have to learn from,\" said Foyth. \"I've worked in training but these two penalties helped me with experience.\"\nFoyth's team-mate, Dele Alli, added: \"Juan deserves a lot of credit. It says a lot about his character after conceding those two penalties at Wolves.\n\"He works hard every day in training and he's come in and got the winner.\"\nPalace lose again when Zaha is not there\nFor Palace, it continues a remarkable record of results when talisman Wilfried Zaha is not available.\nHodgson said Zaha tweaked his hamstring in the final 10 minutes of the Eagles' 3-1 loss to Chelsea last weekend, although the Ivory Coast international did manage to finish that match.\nAnd this result means Palace have now lost each of the past 13 games that they have played when the 26-year-old is absent.\nHis influence has also been shown this season, with him playing a part in five of the eight league goals Palace had scored (three goals and two assists).\nHowever, Roy Hodgson's side, who last won on 25 September with a 3-0 away win against Championship West Brom in the third round of the Carabao Cup, should have at least earned a point against Tottenham.\nDespite the visitors having more of the ball, the home side were a threat at set-pieces in wet conditions.\nTomkins, who later went off injured, should have scored when he lost his marker at the back post but headed narrowly wide following a corner in the second half.\nPalace's best play came in the final 15 minutes, but Lloris, one of six Tottenham changes after he had been suspended for the Champions League tie against PSV, excelled to frustrate Hodgson's team.\nMan of the match - Hugo Lloris (Tottenham)\nSpurs beat Palace again - the stats\nCrystal Palace have lost seven consecutive top-flight matches against a single opponent for the first time ever.\nTottenham have won 1-0 in each of their last five Premier League meetings with Crystal Palace, the longest run of consecutive identical results between two sides in the history of the competition.\nTwenty-six of the last 27 goals scored in Premier League games between Crystal Palace and Spurs have been netted in the second half - there has been one first-half goal scored in the last 15 meetings.\nCrystal Palace are the only side this season yet to score a home Premier League goal excluding penalties.\nTottenham have won more away Premier League games in 2018 than any other side (12). Only once have Spurs won more top-flight away games in a single calendar year (17 in 1960).\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has won nine Premier League games against Crystal Palace - more than he has managed against any other side.\nTottenham have had 146 different goalscorers in the Premier League, more than any other team in the competition's history (excluding own goals).\nJuan Foyth is the third Argentine to score for Spurs in the Premier League, after Erik Lamela and Mauricio Taricco.\n'So pleased' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BT Sport: \"It was a very competitive game. It was an even game and it was tough. Before the game we were talking a lot about how difficult it is to play here.\n\"I'm so pleased because the team fought well under difficult circumstances and got the three points.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to Match of the Day: \"The gap between us and the top teams isn't that big - we've shown that in the last few games.\n\"The players aren't allowing themselves to become disheartened. The attitude throughout was excellent today. In the last 20 or 30 minutes we were laying siege to the Tottenham goal. They will realise that it was quite a fortunate win.\n\"We go home very dejected because once again we have very little to show for our efforts.\"\nWhat's next?\nThe international break means neither side are in action again for two weeks, with Crystal Palace playing away at Manchester United on Saturday, 24 November (15:00 GMT kick-off).\nTottenham have another London derby as they entertain Chelsea on the same day (17:30 GMT)."

It's a completely absurd situation to defend.\n\"In this country normally you cannot show disrespect to the referee and this is a problem because it's shown disrespect to my team, myself and Fulham supporters.\"\nSalah's goal came after goalkeeper Alisson initiated a lightening counter attack, with the Egyptian running unopposed from the halfway line to open the scoring.\n\"We were a bit lucky and maybe because of Robbo it is not 100% offside because of his heel,\" said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\nXherdan Shaqiri's cushioned finish in the second half confirmed victory for the Reds who equalled their best start to a Premier League season, which came in 2002-03.\nFollow Sunday's Premier League action\nLiverpool and Salah approaching their best?\nKlopp has maintained his Liverpool team are not yet at their free-flowing best - and that in itself should swell confidence around Anfield.\nThis victory ensured the Reds remain unbeaten after 12 league outings, eight points better off than at the same time last term and well placed to challenge for the league title.\nLast season Liverpool toiled against the bottom three, drawing twice against West Brom, once against Stoke and losing at Swansea.\nBut Salah, who has now scored five goals and provided five assists in 633 minutes against newly promoted teams, helped to ensure the outcome of this fixture was not in question.\nThe Egyptian had scored nine times at the same stage last term but his performance against Fulham, where he registered his sixth goal of the campaign, suggested he is not far from replicating his best form.\nThe 26-year-old instigated a glorious early exchange with Roberto Firmino to carve the visitors' defence apart, only to see Rico react well to save at his feet.\nAnd that was a precursor to what was to follow, with Rico again saving from the Egyptian before he broke clear to open the scoring.\n\"The most important thing is reacting quick in that situation and it was brilliant: Alisson, Trent (Alexander-Arnold), Mo and done,\" Klopp added.\nRevised style sees Fulham improve\nFulham, whose expansive style of play proved so successful in the Championship last season, have yet to deliver results against clubs in the Premier League.\nThe Cottagers, who spent more than \u00a3100m on players in the summer, arrived at Anfield with the worst defensive record in the league, having conceded 29 goals from their opening 11 fixtures.\nThat prompted Jokanovic into a rethink as he deployed four central defenders in a revised system and fended off pre-match questions about his team selection.\nAnd after early teething problems - with Sadio Mane firing wide from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross - Fulham grew into the game.\nHappy to concede possession and sit deep, the visitors could have delivered the perfect riposte of a goal when Ryan Sessegnon was sent clear by Mitrovic's flick-on.\nThe England under-21 winger, who covered more ground (12.22km) than any other player during the course of the afternoon, guided his shot wide of the right-hand post.\nGerman forward Andre Schurrle then tested Alisson and Mitrovic failed to connect properly with a shot from 10 yards out.\nWhen the Serbia forward powered a header past Alisson from Tom Cairney's cross it appeared as though Jokanovic's strategy might yield an unlikely dividend.\nInstead the visitors, who managed the same number of shots on target as Liverpool in the first half, were undone by a moment of naivety with Denis Odoi's attempt to catch Salah offside.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nFulham close unwanted Barnsley record - the stats\nLiverpool have picked up 30 points from their opening 12 Premier League games (W9 D3 L0) - their joint-best total at this stage in the competition (level with 2002-03).\nFulham have conceded 31 goals from their first 12 league games this season; only Barnsley in 1997-98 conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League campaign (35).\nFulham have taken one point from their past 19 Premier League games against the 'big six' sides (W0 D1 L18), losing all four games this season by an aggregate score of 2-13.\nLiverpool have won all nine home Premier League games under Jurgen Klopp against newly promoted teams, scoring 27 goals and conceding just three.\nLiverpool have kept 10 clean sheets in 14 Premier League games at Anfield in 2018; as many as they'd kept in the past calendar year (10 clean sheets in 21 home league games).\nXherdan Shaqiri has either scored or assisted in five of his past six games for Liverpool in all competitions (two goals, three assists).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Watford for their next Premier League fixture on Saturday, 24 November (15:00 GMT) while Fulham host Southampton on the same day (15:00)."

We know when to press because they have got a lot of good runners but we won a lot of our 50/50s. We deserved the point.\n\"Jordan Pickford made a few good saves but they didn't cut us open. It is down to the training and it is down to the talking and the organisation on the pitch.\"\nMan of the match - Jordan Pickford (Everton)\nSarri sets a record - the stats\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri has become the first manager in Premier League history to remain unbeaten in his first 12 games in the competition (W8 D4 L0), overtaking former Nottingham Forest manager Frank Clark's previous record of 11 games, set in 1994.\nChelsea and Everton have now played out eight goalless draws in the Premier League. Only Everton v Liverpool (nine) has seen more in the competition's history.\nEverton are now winless in their last 24 Premier League visits to Chelsea (D11 L13), their second longest run without a win away at any opponent in the league after a 36-game streak at Leeds United between 1953 and 2001.\nThis was Chelsea 21st Premier League clean sheet against Everton. They have not managed more against any other opponent in the competition (also 21 v Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur).\nThis was Everton manager Marco Silva's first goalless draw in the Premier League since August 2017, when he was in charge of Watford against Brighton.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Chelsea return to Premier League action with a trip to Wembley to face Tottenham on Saturday, 24 November (17:30 GMT).

Against Wolves it was different as the visitors proved stubborn at the back before Mkhitaryan struck.\nHaving drawn against Liverpool and Crystal Palace in their previous two league games, the Gunners are now without a top-flight win in three matches - proof there is much for Emery to work on despite his team's unbeaten run.\nAlex Iwobi, starting a league game for the first time since 28 October, lasted until half-time before he was replaced while Mesut Ozil was also taken off as the under-par Gunners struggled against their vibrant opponents.\nArsenal's first match after the break is away at Bournemouth before back-to-back top-flight matches at home to Tottenham and away to Manchester United.\nEmery will hope his side have returned to winning ways before the north London derby on 2 December.\nWolves have the quality to thrive\nWolves' players were visibly hurting at the final whistle after failing to hang on for a stunning victory.\nThey are without a win in four top-flight games and they have much to ponder during this month's two-week break from action - most it it positive.\nHaving held both leaders Manchester City and Manchester United, Wolves once again proved against Arsenal they are a handful for anyone at this level.\nThey were a frightening force on the counter thanks to Jimenez and Helder Costa.

        "article_text": "Man City 3-1 Man Utd: Hosts claim deserved derby victory & go back top\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho said Manchester City's preparations for their derby victory were helped by playing in two \"friendly\" matches during the past week.\nCity returned to the top of the Premier League as goals from David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Ilkay Gundogan earned the champions three points at Etihad Stadium.\nBut Mourinho said the hosts had an advantage as their past two games - home thrashings of Southampton and Shakhtar Donetsk in which they won by an aggregate 12-1 - were significantly more straightforward than his team's most recent matches.\nThis was United's third away game in succession, following back-to-back wins at Bournemouth last weekend and Juventus on Wednesday.\n\"It's a heavy result for the effort of a team that had three away matches in the same week, with a super difficult match of a high, demanding level in Juventus against a team that had two friendly matches at home against Southampton and Shakhtar,\" Mourinho told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"The physical fatigue and the mental fatigue leads to mistakes. They were tired physically and mentally. You need to be in football or another high-level sport to know what that is. The concentration of the big matches, they dry you. You are dry inside. To be ready again for another big match is not easy.\"\nCity's victory was rarely in doubt after Silva bundled home an early goal to give them a narrow interval advantage.\nThey got the second their superiority deserved with Aguero's rasping, rising finish past David de Gea three minutes into the second half following an exchange of passes with Riyad Mahrez.\nMourinho's side, without injured Paul Pogba, barely mounted a serious threat but were given hope of earning an unlikely point just before the hour when Romelu Lukaku was hauled down by Ederson seconds after he had come on as substitute. Anthony Martial sent the Brazilian keeper the wrong way from the spot.\nIt briefly revived memories of last season's dramatic derby here when United came from two goals down to win, but City never looked like losing control and wrapped up the win two minutes from time when substitute Gundogan took advantage of static United defending to beat De Gea from close range following a 44-pass move.\n\"We deserved the victory,\" City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport. \"The first half we played a little bit with fear and we didn't want to lose the ball. We didn't want to attack and they defended well.\n\"In the second half the game was a bit open so we had to find more space and we made a good performance against a top, top team.\"\n'Mourinho deluded if he can't see gulf in class between Man City & outclassed Man Utd'\nDid Man City score 'the perfect goal'? Reaction to move that took up 2.13% of match\nFootball Daily podcast: Man City v Man Utd - a widening gulf in class\nWho can stop rampant Man City?\nManchester City's answer to Liverpool briefly returning to the head of the Premier League table earlier in the day was emphatic because this win was as comfortable as the scoreline suggests, arguably even more so.\nLiverpool and Chelsea remain unbeaten in the Premier League, Jurgen Klopp's side beating Fulham 2-0 and Maurizio Sarri's side slipping as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton at Stamford Bridge.\nThey remain very much in the title shake-up, as do fourth-placed Tottenham.\nThe problem for the chasing pack appears to be that Manchester City are operating on a different level to everyone else.\nUnited were probably feeling pleased with themselves that somehow, despite barely laying a glove on City, they were actually still in contention for a point until Gundogan's late goal ended all the arguments.\nAnd it was a goal that summed up City under Guardiola.\nThe finish looked simple enough as Gundogan slipped in past some static United defenders to score with ease but it crowned a 44-pass sequence, the most before a goal since Juan Mata scored for Manchester United against Southampton in September 2015.\nCity are two points clear of Liverpool but have a goal difference of +31 as opposed to +18 and this was another of their most difficult fixtures negotiated with their usual flair.\nMan City's old guard key to victory\nManchester City's latest win was built on the foundations of three established members of their recent glories.\nAguero may have gone from brunette to striking blonde but under the new hairstyle remained the same lethal striker who has been the centrepiece of so many of their successes.\nIt was classic Aguero when he scored City's crucial second three minutes after the break, exchanging passes with Mahrez before lashing home a near-post finish that carried so much power, De Gea barely had time to react.\nIt was his 151st goal in 218 Premier League games and his 208th goal in 307 games in all competitions for City. These statistics emphasise his status as one of the modern game's great strikers.\nDavid Silva, at 32 now an elder statesman at City, set them on their way with the early opener and showed his usual knack of finding space in crowded areas and ability to dictate tempo even at the most frenetic times.\nAt the heart of it all was the unsung Fernandinho, the 33-year-old Brazilian patrolling midfield with class and quality, working effectively in the shadows.\nGuardiola knows his worth - and will also know he will be very difficult to replace when the time comes.\nMan United's slow start finishes title hopes\nMourinho has bemoaned his team's slow starts this season and appears at a loss to discover the cure. And it is now too late to salvage any title aspirations.\nThey had survived a couple of narrow escapes before Silva scored after 12 minutes to put them on the back foot once more and to give City the sort of control and impetus they relish.\nUnited clearly missed the injured Pogba, who helped turn this derby around last season, but this was still a performance lacking in invention and serious attacking threat.\nAnd while Gundogan's goal crowned a glorious move, Mourinho will have looked on in anguish as United defenders stood around like statues.\nUnited are now 12 points adrift of City. They can forget the Premier League title for another season.\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\n'Ours was a performance with mistakes' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to Match of the Day: \"We wanted to play good in front of our fans and we know how important it is to play in this game. We did well [in the second half] and that goal from Sergio Aguero helped us a lot after half-time.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho to Sky Sports: \"We were in the game until the 80th-something minute and the third goal killed the spirit and morale of the team.\n\"One thinking is a bad performance and one thinking is a performance with mistakes. I think ours was a performance with mistakes.\n\"We are outside the top four, how can we speak about the title? Let's fight to close the gap to jump into the top four. If we jump into the top four then let's see the difference.\"\nA start to forget for United - the best of the stats\nIt is the first time since 1990-91 that Manchester United have lost as many as four of their opening 12 games in a top-flight season.\nThis is the first time since 1977-78 that United have a negative goal difference after 12 games of a top-flight season.\nIt is the first time in English top-flight history that three clubs have remained unbeaten in their opening 12 games of the season (Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea).\nOnly Fulham (0) have kept fewer clean sheets than Manchester United (1) in the Premier League this season.\nMan City's Sergio Aguero has scored eight Premier League goals against Manchester United - only Alan Shearer (10) has more against the Red Devils in the competition.\nThere were just 30 seconds between Lukaku coming on as a substitute for Man Utd, and winning the penalty that made it 2-1.\nDavid Silva has scored in three consecutive home games in all competitions for Man City for the first time.\nThis was Jose Mourinho's 300th Premier League game as manager - despite defeat today, he's won more games than any other manager in their first 300 in the competition (189).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to West Ham on Saturday, 24 November (15:00 GMT) in the Premier League, while Manchester United host Crystal Palace on the same day (also 15:00)."

There are games that are special games and not just one more, and this was a special game.\n\"It was the first of eight Premier League games until the end of December and a game we needed to win, and it was not enough from the heart.\"\nUnited have won just three of their nine games at Old Trafford this season.\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nRomelu Lukaku had an attempt ruled out for offside and another kept out by Wayne Hennessey, who also produced smart saves to deny Jesse Lingard.\nBut Palace, without a win in their previous seven league games and one point above the bottom three, created several chances as they tried to secure a first league win at Old Trafford since 1989.\nPatrick van Aanholt twice went close, Andros Townsend blazed wide and a header by Cheikhou Kouyate was also disallowed for offside.\nWhere is United's season heading?\nUnited fans have had to endure some disappointments this season, and this was another day to forget for Mourinho and his players.\nOn the eve of the game, the manager claimed United could break into the Premier League's top four by the end of December.\nThey still might, but they will have to play an awful lot better than they did in this laboured performance, which left them 14 points behind leaders Manchester City after just 13 games.\nPaul Pogba and Lukaku were recalled to the side, yet World Cup winner Pogba failed to finish the game and Lukaku is still searching for his first league goal since 15 September as United failed to score at home for the fourth time this campaign.\nLingard was United's most threatening player for spells and his first-time shot from close range brought out the very best from Hennessey.\nAnthony Martial rarely looked like making it six goals in six Premier League games as United dropped two more points ahead of a congested eight-match December programme, which includes games against Arsenal (home) and Liverpool (away).\nUnited have a quick chance to get over this when they host Young Boys in the Champions League on Tuesday.\nHowever, Mourinho added: \"If we play with the same philosophy against Young boys then we won't win.\"\nPalace show they have stomach for a fight\nThe long wait for a Palace league victory at Old Trafford goes on.\nYet Roy Hodgson and his players left Manchester with renewed vigour in their battle to stay out of the relegation zone.\nHodgson has claimed this season his side have not got the results their performances have merited.\n\"At least we got something and on another day if fate had been kinder and we had been a bit more clinical, we could have won it,\" he said.\n\"At least I have got the satisfaction of believing the team played extremely well.\"\nThe odds were stacked against Palace. They had lost on their past 11 league visits to Old Trafford and have not scored a league goal at the ground since 2004.\nHowever, Wilfried Zaha sparkled on his return to his former club as Hodgson's team produced one of their best performances of the season to secure a crucial point.\nZaha's pace caused countless problems, and if Townsend had shown more composure after creating an opening for himself in the second half, Palace would have been celebrating a famous win.\nThey have a tough December on the horizon, including a visit to leaders Manchester City and a home game with Chelsea, but this gritty performance will give them some encouragement.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\n'We didn't win one point - we lost two' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho:\n\"I'm frustrated. We didn't win one point - we lost two. There was not even aggression and not enough intensity.\n\"When the opponent had the ball, we didn't press enough. They were allowed to breathe and relax.\n\"When you are at home and want to win the game then you don't stop until you win it. We played the game nicely but not with enough intensity.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson:\n\"We have played like that the last four games against tough opponents. We have played Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United.\n\"In each of those games we have come out thinking 'we have played well'. I'm proud of the team's performance. I can't ask any more than what they gave me.\n\"The shape, organisation and discipline of the team was as good as it has been. On the counter-attack we looked very dangerous and had some good opportunities.\"\nThere was at least one positive for Man Utd - the stats\nThis was United's first home Premier League clean sheet of the season - they last kept one against Watford in May.\nPalace had 13 shots in this match, their most in an away Premier League game this season. However, just two were on target.\nUnited are unbeaten in their last 21 league meetings with Crystal Palace (W17 D4).\nPalace picked up a first point in a league game at Old Trafford since winning 2-1 in December 1989.\nThis was United's 65th 0-0 draw in the 26 seasons of the Premier League - 31% of them have come in the six seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.\nUnited failed to score in a top-flight home meeting with Crystal Palace for the first time since October 1970.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United are back at Old Trafford on Tuesday when they look to book a place in the Champions League knockout stage when Young Boys (20:00 GMT) visit.\nMeanwhile, Crystal Palace have a week to prepare for the visit of fellow strugglers Burnley to Selhurst Park on 1 December (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 3-2 Southampton: Aleksandar Mitrovic double earns Claudio Ranieri first win\nClaudio Ranieri labelled Aleksandar Mitrovic \"one of the best goalscorers in Europe\" after the striker's double helped Fulham clinch victory in his first game as the Cottagers' boss.\nFulham were seeking only their second Premier League win of the season after Ranieri replaced sacked Slavisa Jokanovic, and it duly arrived after an eventful encounter between the two strugglers.\nMitrovic, 24, had gone six Premier League games without scoring but struck either side of half-time to move the former Newcastle forward to seven Premier League goals this season.\nOnly Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has scored more, although Mitrovic is the top scorer in the Nations League with six from four matches for Serbia.\n\"I asked my team to make a lot of crosses for Mitrovic because he is amazing in the box,\" said Ranieri. \"He can do everything in his career.\"\nThe Italian was afforded a warm reception as he made his way to the technical area, but it was an unhappy start as Stuart Armstrong poked home to reward Southampton's bright opening.\nFulham shrugged off their early lethargy to turn it around before half-time through Mitrovic's angled header, followed by Andre Schurrle's far post finish from Ryan Sessegnon's cross.\nSouthampton, who will feel they had opportunities to claim a point, were back on level terms eight minutes after the break with another from Armstrong, flashed high past Sergio Rico.\nFulham were soon back in front when Mitrovic volleyed past Alex McCarthy, and despite some late pressure Saints are now nine league games without a win as speculation mounts about the future of manager Mark Hughes.\nRanieri's satisfactory start\nThe thunderous noise that greeted the final whistle at Craven Cottage was laced with both elation and relief as Fulham closed out the first win under Ranieri, after some backs-to-the-wall defending in the closing moments.\nRanieri saw all sides of Fulham in his opening game but he also saw what he wanted most of all - three points and real fight on offer after some timid performances left them bottom of the table.\nFulham's defence still creaked under serious pressure, despite that late determination, and they were grateful for heroics from goalkeeper Sergio Rico.\nRanieri received a warm reception but his response was low-key. It was back to business in the Premier League for the man who claimed the title so spectacularly at Leicester City in 2015-16.\nIt was a mixed first half but Ranieri cut an animated figure on occasion, especially when Fulham scored and in that frantic finale.\nAfter Fulham's poor start, this was all about the result rather than the performance - and his first aim was achieved.\nRanieri witnessed a side that needs work but that also has quality he can work on, especially in attack.\nHughes feeling the heat\nHughes entered his confrontation of the Premier League strugglers, fending off mounting speculation that his job was under threat and may even be riding on the outcome of this game.\nSouthampton actually played well for spells but paid a heavy price for failing to make the most of their early superiority, which brought Armstrong's goal and should have yielded more.\nUltimately, this is another damaging result for both Southampton and Hughes as they extend a dismal sequence to nine league games without a win.\nSaints were sloppy in defence as all three goals came from crosses they could and should have dealt with, and have now plunged further into trouble.\nHughes is talking a confident game but results continue to elude him and, if this game does not decide his fate, it certainly increases the urgency for him to secure a victory.\nRanieri can build around key duo\nAs Ranieri studies his squad for strengths and weaknesses in the early days of his reign, he will already be aware of the importance of Mitrovic and Sessegnon.\nRanieri will be looking to seal up that porous Fulham defence, but this win will only have emphasised that he has two potent weapons in the Serb and the 18-year-old.\nSessegnon, understandably, has rough edges to smooth out in his defensive work and was guilty of sloppiness in the build-up to Southampton's second goal - but he has the panache to make a difference at the other end as Fulham look to work their way out of trouble.\nMitrovic, however, is the real danger man after finding his home at Craven Cottage following his struggles at Newcastle United.\nHe has seen his Premier League form tail off in recent weeks but he delivered here and was given a standing ovation both when he was replaced late on and when he made his way back to the dressing room at the final whistle.\nSessegnon was also influential - crossing for Schurrle to score, then defying his diminutive stature to provide a flicked header for Mitrovic's winner.\nThey are the duo Ranieri will lean on heavily.\nMan of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham)\nWhat they said - 'We're scratching our heads'\nFulham boss Claudio Ranieri: \"It was important to come back and come back with a victory. It is a little step but important for the enthusiasm and everything.\n\"It is important to continue in this way. Now we have to forget what we did and improve. Next is Chelsea and it is important to maintain ambition and mentality.\n\"I am confident with my team. We made some good things but we have to work hard to improve on defence.\"\nSouthampton boss Mark Hughes: \"We have had similar stories in other games. We scored a good goal and then all of a sudden we find ourselves behind in a game we dominated.\n\"The two goals are poor from our point of view. We talk about fundamentals until we are blue in the face. We allowed Mitrovic too much space on two occasions. You look back on the game and we are scratching our heads considering what we produced.\n\"I don't think there is a huge amount wrong with how we are going about our business. For the most part we need to keep on going and make sure we are better in the key moments that define a result.\"\nMatch stats - Hughes' low win rate\nMark Hughes has won just three of his 21 Premier League games in charge of Southampton (14.3%), the worst win rate of any Saints manager in the competition (minimum 20 games).\nFulham picked up their first Premier League win in 10 matches, losing seven of the previous nine.\nFulham are without a clean sheet in their last 17 Premier League games, conceding at least twice in 15 of those.\nStuart Armstrong scored a competitive brace for the first time since December 2016 for Celtic against Partick.\nWhat's next\nFulham have a London derby away to Ranieri's former club Chelsea next Sunday (12:00 GMT). Southampton play their rearranged EFL Cup fourth-round tie away to Leicester on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before hosting Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30 GMT)."

We tried, we did a good defensive job for 66 minutes and after that the game changed. We had opportunities and didn't take them. Everyone knows Liverpool are a great team.\n\"I prefer not to speak about refereeing decisions. We accept something that is difficult to accept - but we do it and there is nothing else we can do.\n\"We could do better in the first half on the counter-attack but playing against Liverpool is always very demanding.\n\"I am optimistic, I can feel the ambition of the club and I feel happy training here.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \"We stayed stubborn. They defended and counter-attacked and we had a few really good moments we didn't score, which is not a big problem if we stay on track.\n\"How we closed down the game was just brilliant, especially the third goal. The first goal was brilliant football and the free-kick from Trent [Alexander-Arnold] was a dream. It was a good game against a good side.\"\nOn Jordan Henderson's sending off: \"It happens. Jordan Henderson was not happy about his mistake but what a guy he is. He has a heart like this, so sometimes it leads you on the wrong path. We wanted to change him but we were a little bit too late.\"\nWatford stutter at home - the stats\nWatford have lost three of their past four home top-flight games (W1), as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 15 at Vicarage Road in the Premier League (W8 D4).\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their opening 13 matches of a Premier League season for the first time since 2007-08.\nWatford have lost 16 of their 18 Premier League matches against sides starting that day in the top two, beating Chelsea in September 1999 and Arsenal in January 2017.\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah has six goals in his three league appearances against Watford.\nSalah has had a hand in six goals in his past five league matches for Liverpool (four goals, two assists) - as many as he managed in his previous 11.\nLiverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has been directly involved in goals in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time, assisting against Fulham before scoring against Watford.\nLiverpool's Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in eight goals in his past six league games against Watford (five goals, three assists).\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Leicester City next Saturday (15:00 GMT) for their next Premier League match. Liverpool visit Paris St-Germain on Wednesday in the Champions League (20:00 GMT) before hosting Everton in the Merseyside derby on Sunday 2 December (16:15 GMT)"

        "article_text": "Everton beat Cardiff 1-0 to move into Premier League top six\nEverton moved into the Premier League top six with a hard-fought win over Cardiff at Goodison Park.\nGylfi Sigurdsson's close-range finish was enough to help his side claim three points, tapping home after Neil Etheridge had denied Theo Walcott.\nThe Toffees dominated possession throughout, but it was in the second half when they put real pressure on the visitors as Sigurdsson also had a shot cleared off the line by Sol Bamba shortly before the breakthrough.\nThe result leaves Neil Warnock's men in the bottom three, with just one point and two goals from their first six away matches.\nFollow Spurs v Chelsea here\nSigurdsson makes it count\nEverton had won their past three games at Goodison Park but were barely troubling Etheridge's goal before record signing Sigurdsson intervened.\nThe Iceland midfielder had scored five goals in his past eight Everton appearances and his outstanding form has been a major reason for their rise up the table.\nHe took a while to get going here, but he was in the right place at the right time to slot home on 58 minutes after Etheridge's fine, low save.\nPrior to that, Everton's \u00a3100m-plus attack had failed to fire in front of an expectant crowd.\nFresh from scoring for Brazil in midweek, Richarlison led the line but he looked distinctly out of sorts against a resolute Cardiff defence.\nBut Sigurdsson's goal fired Everton into life as Etheridge was required to make further good saves from Richarlison and substitutes Cenk Tosun and Ademola Lookman.\nRugged Cardiff rarely threaten\nWarnock has praised Cardiff's recent displays and his side offered a decent, if ultimately fruitless away performance at Goodison Park.\nAfter beating Brighton last time out, they sought to win back-to-back games in the top flight of English football for the first time in 56 years.\nMarshalled by their impressive centre-back Bamba, they held the home team at arm's length for much of the match but their lack of penetration on the break cost them.\nTheir only effort on target arrived midway through the second half when Victor Camarasa's swerving shot was beaten away by Jordan Pickford.\nIn-form striker Callum Paterson had scored three in his past four Cardiff games but was well shackled here, heading over his best opportunity with just three minutes left.\nThe Bluebirds have lost their past four away games against strong opposition in the form of Tottenham, Chelsea, Liverpool and Everton.\nNext, they host fellow promoted side Wolves followed by West Ham and Southampton as they bid to pick up much-needed points.\nMan of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson (Everton)\nWhat they said\nEverton boss Marco Silva: \"We deserved the three points and controlled the match. We tried to play our way but we started slowly and against a strong, defensive team like Cardiff, we need to be faster. In the second half, we gave them more problems and we were mature in the final minutes to get the win.\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock: \"They were better than us in the final third but I can't fault my team's performance. We were very well organised but we need to be a bit more clinical. There were some fine margins that went against us and I wasn't happy with two incidents before their goal.\"\nEverton extend impressive home form - the stats\nEverton are unbeaten in their past nine home top-flight games against Cardiff (W7 D2).\nCardiff have scored fewer away goals than any other side in English league football this season (two).\nEverton have lost just one of their past 10 home Premier League games (W6 D3).\nEverton had 71% possession - their most in a Premier League game since February 2016 (76% vs West Brom).\nWhat's next\nEverton travel the short distance across Stanley Park to take on Liverpool at Anfield next Sunday in the league (16:15 GMT).\nCardiff are at home to Wolves on Friday night (20:00)."

        "article_text": "West Ham 0-4 Manchester City: Champions cruise to London Stadium win\nManchester City were \"quite lucky\" and nowhere near their best in their 4-0 win over West Ham, says boss Pep Guardiola.\nCity scored four of their nine shots to record an eighth consecutive victory in all competitions and remain two points above Liverpool in the Premier League.\nThe game was over by half-time, with David Silva, Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane all getting in on the act.\nSilva poked home Sterling's deflected cross for the opener and Sane then rolled in a low cross for Sterling to tap into an empty net.\nSane added a fine third from Sterling's volleyed cross, with the German's touch leaving defender Fabian Balbuena on the ground, allowing him to slot home.\nWest Ham were much better in the second half and Michail Antonio hit the post - but Sane scored his second and City's fourth in injury time.\nManuel Pellegrini's Hammers side, who saw Marko Arnautovic hobble off late on, have now won only once in seven games.\n\"If you see the result, especially after the international break, it is good,\" Guardiola told BBC Sport. \"You see Real Madrid,Bayern Munich and Manchester United - they struggled.\n\"The players train in a different way, so it is difficult to come back.\n\"West Ham had chances and they didn't score. We were quite lucky but we will come back to our best.\n\"We are a humble team and today we weren't at our best - too many touches, our passing was not good enough but our running was fantastic.\"\nRelive the action as it happened\nFollow reaction from every Premier League game\nCity cruise at London Stadium again\nThe Premier League champions have now played four games at West Ham's new stadium, scoring four or five in each one.\nThey were stylish and clinical in the first half and efficient after the break.\nSome of City's football in the opening 35 minutes was what we have come to expect from Guardiola's side. Sterling and Sane in particular were brilliant as they dominated possession with plenty of crisp passing.\nSilva scored their opener from close range, although Sterling will not be credited with the assist as his cross took a slight deflection.\nThe two wide men combined for the second goal as Sane shimmied past Pablo Zabaleta and gifted Sterling a simple goal.\nSterling then set up Sane, who showed wonderful composure to turn round a defender and guide a shot into the net.\nCity are the only team not to drop a point from a winning position in the Premier League this season, so a comeback was never really on the cards and they looked comfortable, though not spectacular, in the second half.\nIn truth, Sane's injury-time fourth - from substitute Gabriel Jesus' cross - was harsh on West Ham.\nArnautovic injury a worry for Hammers\nWest Ham were thrashed once again by City, and have won only once since 29 September, but they perhaps deserved better than a 4-0 defeat in the end.\nThey were outclassed in the first half - although they made it easy for City - but they improved after bringing on the lively Aaron Cresswell at the break.\nAntonio was unlucky to hit the outside of the post as he ran onto Javier Hernandez's raking through ball.\nArnautovic and Balbuena headed efforts over the bar as their chances for a consolation came and went.\nPellegrini said: \"We had as many chances as City. We play the way we must play every game.\n\"It's difficult to say when you lose 4-0 but I am happy the way we played. I am happy with a lot of things, just not the result but I think that the goals are not acceptable.\"\nArnautovic was hurt by a fair Nicolas Otamendi tackle and tried to play on after treatment - but did limp off late on with all of West Ham's substitutions already used.\nThe Austria international is the club's top scorer this season with five goals.\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Man City)\nCity match Pompey's 1950s landmark - match stats\nManchester City became the second side from outside London to win six consecutive top-flight games in the capital after Portsmouth did so between 1950 and 1951.\nWest Ham have lost all four of their meetings with City at London Stadium, scoring just once and conceding 17.\nCity are only the second team to score four or more goals in three consecutive Premier League away games against the same opponent, after Chelsea at Bolton (2009-2011).\nCity are unbeaten in their past 19 league games (W16 D3), conceding just eight goals.\nRaheem Sterling has had a hand in more Premier League goals at London Stadium than any other visiting player (six - one goal, five assists).\nManchester City's David Silva has been involved in more goals against West Ham than he has against any other opponent for the club (10 - six goals, four assists).\nSilva has scored in four consecutive competitive appearances for City for the first time.\nWhat's next?\nCity visit Lyon on Tuesday (20:00 GMT kick-off) in a top-of-the-table Champions League group match and then host Bournemouth in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00).\nWest Ham visit Newcastle in the league next Saturday (15:00)."

We were in a similar position against Cardiff and you know when you play against a team with 10 men, they're going to play a certain way.\n\"It's a poor penalty that we conceded and it's a really good opportunity missed. You've got to be able to kill the game off, but we weren't able to do that.\"\nOn James Maddison's red card: \"I haven't seen the sending off again. The only thing I did see was that there wasn't a great reaction to it, which says to me that it was the right decision.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"We came back in the second half with desire and energy to play forward. We played like 11 men and I think we deserved the win.\n\"Jamie gave us this feeling to believe in ourselves. It was important to protect him in the first half because he was injured for two weeks, but I wanted to bring him on in the second half.\"\nOn Maddison's dismissal: \"I need to see it again, but of course it was tough for us to see his sending off. We had a fantastic reaction to play with 10 men and this performance is like a win. It's one point but it's good.\"\nMatch stats - Leicester's red mist descends again\nBrighton have lost just one of their last nine home Premier League games (W4, D4).\nSince the start of last season, Leicester have both scored and conceded in a league-high 33 Premier League games.\nAt 35 years and 60 days, Glenn Murray is the ninth oldest outfield player to reach 100 Premier League appearances.\nNo English player has scored more goals in Europe's big five leagues this season than Murray (7).\nBrighton defensive duo Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy both made their 50th Premier League appearances in this game, with only goalkeeper Mat Ryan (51) playing more often for the club in the competition.\nLeicester have picked up four red cards in the Premier League this season, twice as many as any other side.\nVardy has scored 12 penalties since his Premier League debut in August 2014, a figure only Sergio Aguero (17) and Harry Kane (16) can better in that period.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to Huddersfield Town in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 December (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Leicester take on Southampton in the rearranged EFL Cup fixture on Tuesday, 27 November (kick-off 19:45 GMT)."

I am so happy, so pleased,\" Pochettino told Match of the Day. \"I don't need to analyse too much.

I think we played very badly in all directions - physically, mentally, technically and tactically.\n\"I knew we had some problems and with this performance today it was clear to everybody we have problems to solve. I think in the last three or four matches we have started not really very well.\n\"Today I did not like anybody.\"\nStriker Alvaro Morata still looks a player lacking in confidence and the Spaniard was caught offside more times (3) than he had shots on target in the game (0).\nThe threat of dangerman Hazard, who had seven goals and four assists before the game, was also negated, with the Belgium captain's best effort in the opening period pushed away by Hugo Lloris - the French goalkeeper's only save of the game.\nWhat next?\nBoth side are back in European action next week.\nTottenham face a crucial Champions League tie against Inter Milan on Wednesday, while Chelsea host PAOK Salonika in the Europa League on Thursday.\nSon's half century - the stats\nTottenham have won three of their past four Premier League games against Chelsea, as many as they had in their previous 20 against them in the competition (W3 D9 L8).\nChelsea suffered their first league defeat of the season, last losing on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign (0-3 v Newcastle).\nTottenham have won consecutive league games against Chelsea for the first time since August 1987.\nSpurs have won more Premier League London derby matches than any other side since Mauricio Pochettino took charge of the club (22).\nTottenham's Dele Alli has scored more goals against Chelsea than he has against any other side (six).\nSpurs striker Harry Kane has scored 25 goals in Premier League London derbies, putting him joint-sixth in the all-time list (level with former Arsenal forward Robin van Persie).\nSon Heung-min's strike was his 50th goal for Tottenham in 154 appearances for the club.\nChelsea's Olivier Giroud became the second player in Premier League history to score 20 goals as a substitute (also Jermain Defoe, who has 24)."

Bournemouth were four points behind us and could have been near our position with a win.\"\nAfter beginning the weekend in sixth, Bournemouth drop two places to eighth and have now lost their past three league matches.\nCherries boss Eddie Howe felt key moments went against his side, particularly when David Brooks saw his early strike disallowed for offside and Lerma hit the post late on.\n\"We're disappointed with the result - we felt we were very much in that game, but we were on the wrong end of some decisions,\" said Howe. \"I've not seen it, but I'm told the David Brooks [disallowed] goal was onside and the luck was just missing for us - such as Jefferson Lerma's shot hitting the post.\n\"My players gave everything. We started the game brightly and Arsenal came back into it, but you won't see something like their first goal again. Jefferson stuck his leg out and it went in - that was the sort of luck which went against us.\"\nAubameyang the hero again\nThat run of dropping points in four of their past five games had reduced some of the excitement generated during the early weeks of manager Emery's reign.\nBut this impressive performance, against a side which began the day just four points behind the Gunners, will raise hopes among supporters that they can sustain a top-four challenge this season.\nWith Alexandre Lacazette ruled out with a groin injury, Emery switched formation to a back three, with Aubameyang the lone striker.\nThe Gabon international responded by netting again and moving to the top of the Premier League scoring charts alongside Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.\nTo further highlight his importance to the side, Aubameyang has now been directly involved in 23 goals in 26 league appearances since joining Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund in January.\nThe 29-year-old was ably supported on this occasion by Alex Iwobi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, with 14 of the Gunners' 20 shots at goal coming from those three players.\nThe formation change also allowed Sead Kolasinac to be a constant threat down the Arsenal left, with the Bosnia-Herzegovina international having a hand in both goals.\nBournemouth momentum stalling\nBournemouth have enjoyed a brilliant season so far but this loss made it three straight defeats - more than they had suffered in the opening 10 games of the campaign.\nThey were second best for much of this match, but manager Eddie Howe can point to two key moments of misfortune.\nBrooks' disallowed goal will leave the Cherries rueing the lack of video assistant referee (VAR), which is being introduced in the Premier League from next term, while there was also little a manager could do to legislate for a spectacular own goal - Lerma's thunderous finish as he stretched to cut out Kolasinac's pass giving Begovic no chance.\nDespite those key incidents going against them, Howe's side demonstrated considerable spirit to level before half-time thanks to a fine finish from Joshua King, fit again after four games out with an ankle injury.\nAnd after falling behind once more in the second half they were unlucky not to equalise when Lerma's long-range strike hit the post late on.\nDespite the disappointment, the team have made huge strides this season - they had to wait until the end of December last term to reach their current tally of 20 points.\nHowever, with games against Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United before the end of the year, Howe faces a real challenge if he is to sustain Bournemouth's top-six challenge into 2019.\nManager, father figure, dinner companion - what makes Howe England's 'special one'?\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\nWhat they said - 'the luck was against us'\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"If you look at the two goals we conceded, an own goal and the winning goal, for all Arsenal's good play the game could have gone any way.\"\nOn Arsenal's winning goal: \"I don't think the players individually would say they switched off, but as a team we didn't look alert and we paid the price for that. It's really important that the players don't lose confidence and we have to try and respond next week.\"\nArsenal boss Unai Emery: \"In 90 minutes we deserved to win. We worked with the system sometimes, it's another possibility and we spoke in the dressing room about how we can be better and control matches. But we have won with another system and we can also do that.\n\"Bournemouth pushed a lot but I'm very happy with every player and how they worked and it's good for next week. We are going to play another match against a top team like Tottenham.\"\nArsenal march on - the stats\nAfter losing just two of their opening 10 games in the Premier League this season (W6 D2), Bournemouth have lost their past three in a row.\nArsenal have already won as many Premier League away games this season (four of six) as they did in the whole of the 2017-18 campaign (four of 19).\nBournemouth have lost back-to-back home games in the league for the first time since August 2017, when they lost their first two of the 2017-18 campaign.\nArsenal are one of only two teams yet to lead at half-time in a Premier League game this term (alongside Cardiff) - though they have gone on to win eight of those 13 fixtures.\nBournemouth striker Josh King scored his 35th goal in the Premier League, 10 more than the player with the next most for the Cherries (Callum Wilson with 25).\nSince being promoted to the Premier League in 2015, only Swansea (12) have scored more own goals in the competition than Bournemouth's seven.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Ukrainian side Vorskla Poltava in the Europa League on Thursday (17:55 GMT kick-off) before hosting Tottenham in the north London derby in the Premier League next Sunday (14:05).\nNext up for Bournemouth is a trip to Etihad Stadium to play champions Manchester City next Saturday (15:00)."

We know that happiness doesn't last forever but this is how you show your character, bouncing back from these moments.\n\"It was probably one of the worst performances we have had. We have to take a good look, find out why and prepare better.\"\nThe Terriers had arrived at Molineux with the worst scoring record in the division - mustering just six goals from their opening 12 games - but Mooy's first goal of the campaign delivered an early lead as he placed his effort from Erik Durm's cut-back.\nThe Australia midfielder then secured the points for the visitors in the second period with a curling free-kick, beating home goalkeeper Rui Patricio at his near post.\n\"It lifts the confidence and their mood,\" Huddersfield boss Wagner said. \"Away wins are always very important in the Premier League and now we have the first one we have to try and surf on this wave we have created.\n\"The players have shown better performances - or at least comparable performances - this season but they have not got the rewards.\"\nWolves, who toiled during the first half, briefly threatened to equalise after the break. However, goal-line technology showed that a Raul Jimenez header had just been cleared in time by Huddersfield midfielder Philip Billing - with all but an agonising 1.8cm of the ball crossing the line.\nThe result sees Huddersfield climb to 14th in the table, while Wolves remain in 11th.\nHuddersfield spark into life\nAfter a dismal start of 10 games without a victory to their second season in the Premier League, Wagner's Huddersfield side appear to have now sparked into life.\nThis win is their second in three matches, in a period when they have collected seven points from a possible nine.\nWagner took his side to Marbella in the south of Spain during the international break and at times there was a sunshine feel to their football in the West Midlands.\nMooy's opening goal was reward for a wonderful move down the left involving Billing and Durm, and their slick passing allowed them to establish an early rhythm that the hosts struggled to contain.\nThe only complaint was that Huddersfield did not confirm their superiority earlier than Mooy's second goal.\nTerence Kongolo spurned a chance after a perfectly executed, pre-planned corner routine, and Patricio also saved a Steve Mounie header that was directed straight at him.\nAlex Pritchard twice found himself in excellent shooting positions, and was denied on the second occasion by Wolves' Portugal goalkeeper after a glorious interchange between Mooy and Billing on the right.\nMooy's coup de grace, from 20 yards out, was no more than they deserved and it ensured they are unbeaten in three matches for the first time this calendar year.\nWolves fail to respond\nSince their promotion to the Premier League Wolves have forged a reputation as a passing team, but also as a second-half team.\nPrior to this fixture, 10 of Wanderers' 12 goals had arrived after the interval, allowing Nuno's side to collect four victories from the opening 12 games.\nThat resilience has also contributed to creditable draws against both Manchester clubs, as well as Arsenal in their last Premier League encounter.\nBut this fixture highlighted that their capacity to recover is far from guaranteed in the top flight.\nHaving been hindered by a series of errant passes, a half-time revision of tactics and the introduction of Morgan Gibbs-White and Adama Traore did allow Wolves to build some momentum after the break.\nAnd had Jimenez's header from Traore's cross travelled just 18mm further it may have laid the platform for a grandstand finish.\nBut in the aftermath of that nearest of near-misses, the impetus was lost and as Wolves' control of possession started to drift, the visitors regained their composure and extended their lead.\nMan of the match - Philip Billing (Huddersfield Town)\nHuddersfield's first top-flight win at Wolves since 1938 - the stats\nThere has not been a draw between Wolves and Huddersfield in any of the past 13 encounters in all competitions - two wins for Wolves, 11 for Huddersfield.\nHuddersfield have won a top-flight match away to Wolves for the first time since December 1938, when they ran out 4-1 winners under manager Clem Stephenson (D2 L10).\nWolves have now lost each of their past three home league games, as many defeats as in their previous 30 such matches (P30 W19 D8 L3).\nHuddersfield Town have won an away Premier League match without conceding a goal for the first time since their first such match in the competition (3-0 v Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park).\nWolverhampton Wanderers have lost 13 of their past 19 home Premier League matches (W2 D4), conceding 42 goals while scoring just 17 times.\nIn this match against Huddersfield, Wolves named six Portuguese players in their starting XI - the last time a side started six or more foreigners from the same country in a Premier League encounter was back in December 2013 (Newcastle - six Frenchman v Stoke).\nAaron Mooy's brace is the first time any Huddersfield Town player has scored more than one goal in the same Premier League match since he himself did so against Watford back in December 2017 - 344 days ago.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Cardiff for their next Premier League match on Friday, 30 November (20:00 GMT). Huddersfield welcome Brighton to the John Smith's Stadium on Saturday, 1 December (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-2 Newcastle United: Rafael Benitez's side win third consecutive game\nNewcastle secured their third successive Premier League victory as they capitalised on Burnley's defensive frailties to move up to 13th in the table.\nFederico Fernandez's effort, which deflected in off Clarets defender Ben Mee for an own goal, and Ciaran Clark's header from a Matt Ritchie cross proved decisive for Rafael Benitez's side.\nBurnley had lost their past 23 top-flight matches in which they had conceded the first two goals and although Sam Vokes scored - connecting with Mee's long ball to loop a header over goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from almost 18 yards - they were unable to force an equaliser.\nThat would have been harsh on Newcastle, who were superior for long periods and could have added to their tally through Ritchie and substitute Joselu, who struck the post.\nDefeat leaves Burnley 17th in the table, one point above the relegation zone.\nDyche expects questions about Burnley's poor form\nBurnley's defensive woe continues\nWhile Burnley began the match having scored the same number of goals (12) as at this stage last term, their major problems have come at the other end of the pitch.\nTheir success in finishing seventh in the Premier League in May was largely based on their solid defence, but those foundations have crumbled in a start littered with individual and collective errors.\nClark's goal was the 27th they have conceded this season - it took until 31 March for them to concede that many in 2017-18.\nBoth of Newcastle's first-half goals were symptomatic of those problems. Mee's own goal came after Clarets forward Chris Wood made a dreadful attempt to clear a corner under little pressure, and it was compounded when the defender diverted home a shot that appeared to be drifting wide.\nNewcastle's second was another gift, with Burnley initially failing to react at a corner and then allowing Clark a free header from eight yards.\nThings might have been worse for the hosts but Magpies wing-back Ritchie somehow contrived to miss from two yards out in the second period after another defensive error.\nBurnley also appear to have another problem, with former England defender Danny Mills critical of the predictable nature of their attacking play.\n\"I'm a massive fan of Sean Dyche, but you can't keep playing like that - pumping long balls up to two big lads up front,\" Mills told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"They need something different. They'll score the odd goal like that but not two or three and then you're not going to dominate sides, so you'll always be under pressure. They need to change the way they play.\"\nNewcastle finding their feet\nAfter an abject start, taking three points from a possible 30 in a winless 10-game run, Newcastle have at last found their feet.\nBenitez's side had lost each of their past 10 Premier League games played on a Monday night.\nBut, if the omens were not in their favour, their performance at Turf Moor was indicative of a team growing in confidence.\nBenitez's tactics, which included the deployment of a trio of central midfielders, enabled them to control the game.\nThere were also solid performances from Fernandez and Fabian Schar at the heart of a reinforced rearguard.\nThe Argentina and Switzerland defenders both arrived in a summer when a lack of investment in the transfer market led to supporter protests.\nBut unity appears to have been temporarily restored and both played their part in this success, making 10 clearances each, alongside Clark, who made 11.\nMan of the match - Ciaran Clark (Newcastle)\n'Every game is like a final for us' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez, talking to BBC Sport: \"Every game for us is like a final. Winning is massive because it gives us more confidence. There is still a long race ahead but we are doing well and hopefully we can continue that.\n\"We needed to win and to perform well. The players did it and were amazing in terms of effort, organisation and team spirit.\n\"We were working in the week trying to manage Burnley's two big centre-forwards and the players did really well.\n\"The main thing for us is to make sure we can get something out of these games. We have confidence now and the players will continue pushing and working hard.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm frustrated that the margins that are so important in these games have gone against us.\n\"The first goal is frustrating because it is unlucky, going in off a deflection, and the second goal is a soft goal. From then on, in the main, we were very good, we deserved the goal and got back into it.\n\"The second half, after a slow start, we provided enough to get an equaliser. We created chances but now we have to take them and then lock the door. There were better signs but we need results, we know that.\"\nBurnley's bleak home form - the stats\nBurnley have won just one of their past nine Premier League home games (D2 L6).\n54.5% of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season have been headers (6/11), a league-high proportion.\nNewcastle's opener on three minutes 35 seconds was their earliest away Premier League goal since Yohan Cabaye scored against Sunderland in October 2012 (2:10).\nSince the start of 2016-17, only Lewis Dunk (4) has scored more own-goals in the Premier League than Mee (3, level with Ryan Shawcross).\nClark has scored two goals in his past four Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 25.\nRitchie has registered 14 league assists for Newcastle since joining before 2016-17, more than any other player for the club.\nVokes' goal was scored from 17.65 yards out, the furthest distance for a headed Premier League goal since Jamie Vardy for Leicester against Sunderland in August 2015 (18.03).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Crystal Palace in their next Premier League match on Saturday, 1 December (15:00 GMT).\nNewcastle also return to league action on Saturday, 1 December when they host West Ham (15:00 GMT)."

Coming into the season we had high hopes and we are a good team. We should be winning here, we should be beating Huddersfield at home. We need to look at ourselves.\n\"We are not used to losing games since the manager came in. The run we are on is uncharted territory for us.\"\nA tale of two promoted sides\nBoth sides won automatic promotion from the Championship last season, though they had adjusted to life in the Premier League with rather differing fortunes.\nWolves' intricate playing style - and their spending power in the transfer market - helped them take to the top flight with a flourish, initially.\nBy contrast, Cardiff's more direct, often limited approach - and modest financial resources - contributed to a difficult start to the campaign which saw them enter this fixture second from bottom of the table.\nWarnock's men launched long throws into the Wolves penalty area in the early stages, hoping to feed off the scraps of possession which came their way.\nThe visitors also struggled to play with much fluency under the steady, pouring rain, though their first counter-attack of note led to a goal.\nFrom a resulting Joao Moutinho corner, Raul Jimenez's flicked header was superbly saved by Neil Etheridge and Doherty was the quickest to react at the back post, slamming the ball into the roof of the net.\nDespite the pace they boasted in wide positions, Wolves did not threaten much from that point, although they defended stoutly in the face of determined Cardiff pressure.\nArter was an improbable candidate to bring them level, but twice he was inches away from doing so - once with a powerful half-volley which hit the post and again with a sweetly struck volley which whistled just wide.\nIt was fitting that the attack dog of the Cardiff midfield was a key part of the equaliser, looping the ball back into the penalty area before it made its way to Gunnarsson.\nThat goal lit the fuse for a rousing end to the game from Cardiff, who secured victory in stunning fashion as Bobby Reid's shot was blocked, with the ball rolling invitingly for Hoilett to smash his curling strike into the top corner.\nRivalries renewed\nThere was an edge to this game, not least because last season's corresponding fixture in the Championship had ended in such chaotic fashion.\nRuben Neves' free-kick gave Wolves a precious 1-0 win - but only because Cardiff managed to miss two penalties in added time to spark ecstatic celebrations for their opponents.\nAs Wolves' coaches and players ran on to the pitch at the final whistle, manager Nuno Espirito Santo forgot to shake hands with Warnock, who reacted furiously and refused to accept the Portuguese's subsequent apology.\nThere was a more conciliatory tone in the build-up to this rematch, with both men saying they had moved on from that incident.\nAnd while there was certainly a raw physicality to some of the collisions - with both sets of centre-backs commanding in the air - tempers did not boil over.\nThere was no shortage of passion, though, with the guttural roar from the home crowd at the final whistle demonstrating how much this rare victory meant to Cardiff.\nThis time, it was Warnock, rather than Nuno, who was on the pitch, albeit in a calmer fashion, striding towards his eighth decade with a beaming smile.\nMan of the match - Sean Morrison (Cardiff)\nCardiff, the comeback kings? - the stats\nCardiff have won consecutive home games in the same top-flight season for the first time since 1961-62.\nThis was the first time Wolves have lost a league game that they opened the scoring in since February 2017 (2-1 v Burton Albion), ending a run of 44 such games without defeat.\nCardiff have won three of the past four Premier League home games in which they have conceded the first goal - coming back to beat Fulham (4-2), Brighton (2-1) and Wolves (2-1).\nCardiff have picked up nine of their 11 Premier League points this season from trailing positions, the joint-most in the division alongside Arsenal.\nAfter losing just one of their first eight games in the Premier League this season (W4 D3), Wolves have since lost five of their past six (D1).\n91% of Cardiff's points in the Premier League this season have been won at home (10/11); the highest ratio in the competition.\nSince the start of last season, Hoilett has been directly involved in more league goals (21 - 10 goals, 11 assists) than any other Cardiff player.\nGunnarsson scored his first Premier League goal since August 2013, when he netted the Bluebirds' first goal in the competition (v Manchester City).\nWhat's next?\nCardiff are at West Ham on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) and Wolves are at home to Chelsea on Wednesday (19:45 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 0-3 West Ham: Hernandez and Anderson seal win at Benitez's Newcastle\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez said the difference in transfer budgets was a key reason as to why his side lost to fellow mid-table side West Ham.\nJavier Hernandez, a \u00a316m-signing in 2017, with two goals and a late strike from \u00a336m summer capture Felipe Anderson ended the Magpies' run of three successive wins. The visiting attack also included Marko Arnautovic, who cost the London club \u00a320m last season.\nIn contrast to the Hammers, who spent close to \u00a3100m in the last transfer window, Newcastle made a net profit of \u00a320m from their transactions.\nBenitez said: \"They have spent the money on offensive players and they made the difference.\n\"We are working on [signings in January], but it is a question of money. What they spend, what we spend, you can see that on the pitch.\n\"I cannot complain of the effort of the players or the commitment but again today we had chances, but they scored theirs.\"\nHernandez grabbed his first in the 11th minute, just as some Newcastle fans were taking to their seats following a \"walk-in protest\" against the club owner - had they waited another minute they would not have witnessed the calamitous defending from their side.\nRobert Snodgrass was allowed to run down the left and deliver an in-swinging cross for his Mexican team-mate who got himself in front of Federico Fernandez to poke in.\nHernandez then missed a couple of great chances before he fired home the second from Arnautovic's flick-on.\nAnd with the final kick of the game, Anderson capped off an exceptional display by slotting in West Ham's third under the body of keeper Martin Dubravka.\nThe victory was only the Hammers' second in the league at Newcastle since 1998, and moves them into 13th spot, on 15 points, Newcastle drop down to 14th and have 12 points.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nWest Ham show they are a class above\nWest Ham's heavy home defeat by Manchester City last week was an anomaly because of the stature of their opponents. At St James' Park, the Hammers found themselves against a team with similar aspirations for the season and on the same number of points - however, by full-time it was quite stark that there was a difference in quality between the two sides.\nA large chunk of West Ham's summer transfer budget went on midfielder Anderson who produced a man-of-the-match performance that showcased his surging runs and great range of passing.\nHe deservedly got on the scoresheet with seconds remaining when he brushed off a weak challenge from Fabian Schar to slot home. The Brazilian had also provided a brilliant ball for Hernandez, who should have hit the target instead of the side-netting with the score at 1-0.\nThe Mexican got the ball rolling with a close-range finish in the first-half, and finally scored his second on 63 minutes when he latched on to Arnautovic's header and fired low past Newcastle's Czech keeper.\nPelegrini praised his attack after the match.\n\"Arnautovic, Anderson, Snodgrass and Hernandez, four players - all of them have quality, all of them have pace, they have ability, that's the point,\" said the Chilean.\n\"It wasn't just one player today. The four offensive players and the players in the middle that they had, they are quite good and will create problems against anyone.\"\nNewcastle back down to earth with a bump\nAfter a run of three wins against mid-table sides which pulled them out of the relegation mire, this defeat suggested that Newcastle face another fight to stay in the league.\nThey created few clear chances. Ayoze Perez headed high over the bar when he should have hit the target, while fellow forward Salomon Rondon had two efforts blocked by Aaron Cresswell.\nNewcastle brought on Joselu to try to boost the attack, but instead of lifting the home support he brought out derision with a woeful cross in the area which summed up his side's day.\nMan of the match - Felipe Anderson (West Ham)\nThe Magpies as bad as 1953-54 team - the stats\nNewcastle have lost their first Premier League game against West Ham since September 2015, having won three on the bounce against the Hammers prior to today.\nWest Ham recorded their biggest Premier League victory against Newcastle at St James' Park since October 1998 (also 3-0).\nNewcastle have lost six of their opening eight Premier League games at St. James' Park this season (W2) - the Magpies last suffered as many defeats in their opening eight home league games of a season during the 1953-54 campaign (P8 W2 D0 L6).\nWest Ham have kept their first away clean sheet of the season and their first on the road in the competition since their final away game of the 2017-18 campaign against Leicester (2-0).\nAnderson has scored four goals in his last four Premier League games having netted just one in his opening 10 appearances in the competition for the Hammers.\nHernandez's brace was his first in the Premier League since August 2017 in a 2-3 defeat against Southampton.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are at home to Cardiff on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) and Newcastle are away at Everton on Wednesday (19:45 GMT)."

All the big ones against us he got wrong.\"\nMathias Jorgensen gave Huddersfield the lead after 55 seconds - the fastest goal in the Premier League this season - when he headed in off the post after Brighton had failed to clear their lines.\nThe visitors made their numerical advantage count following Mounie's dismissal, Shane Duffy equalising deep into added time at the end of the first half, before Florin Andone struck from close range after the break.\n\"This is why at the moment football is no fun, absolutely no fun,\" added Wagner. \"The referee has a big part to play and I don't think he did his best. Even if he didn't mean to.\n\"I don't like to be disrespectful but I don't want to discuss anything else apart from the referee's decisions. We don't have to discuss anything in football, nothing.\"\nRelive the action at the John Smith's Stadium\nTerriers fail to build on fast start\nHaving taken just three points from their first 10 games, Huddersfield had won two and drawn one of their previous three league matches to climb out of the relegation zone.\nWagner's side could hardly have wished for a better start as they took the lead inside the opening minute.\nPhilip Billing's long throw caused chaos in the Brighton rearguard as Bruno mis-hit his clearance straight to Jorgensen, whose header struck the inside of the post on its way past Mat Ryan.\nMounie thumped a powerful effort over the crossbar not long afterwards as the Terriers laid siege to the Brighton goal.\nThe Frenchman's straight red card for a high challenge on Bissouma proved to be the turning point, though.\nDuffy's header on the stroke of half-time from Solly March's excellent cross galvanised the visitors, whose winning goal came following a period of sustained pressure.\nPatient Seagulls claim rare away win\nOnly Cardiff and Fulham had collected fewer away points than Brighton prior to Saturday's encounter.\nThe Seagulls' travel sickness looked set to continue following Jorgensen's early opener, but Chris Hughton's team eventually gained a stranglehold on proceedings in West Yorkshire.\nJonathan Hogg somehow managed to block Andone's goal-bound effort on the line after Duffy's header had been saved by Lossl.\nJose Izquierdo also forced Lossl into action with a curling effort from the edge of the box, before Duffy's powerful header levelled.\nBrighton, who had left top scorer Glenn Murray on the bench, remained firmly in control after the break and got the second goal their superiority deserved when Andone ghosted in front of his marker to head in March's pin-point cross.\nThe win ends the Seagulls' three-match winless run and lifts Hughton's side nine points clear of the Premier League's bottom three.\nMan of the match - Solly March (Brighton)\nJorgensen goal fastest since January - the stats\nHuddersfield have won just one of their last 10 Premier League home games, drawing two and losing seven.\nBrighton have scored in seven consecutive league games for the first time since February 2017, when they put together a run of nine.\nHuddersfield have scored in three consecutive home league games for the first time since December 2017.\nBrighton have won two of their last four Premier League away games (L2), as many victories as they managed in their previous 23 on the road in the competition (D6 L15).\nMathias Jorgensen's goal after 55 seconds was the fastest scored in the Premier League since 31 January, when Christian Eriksen netted after 11 seconds for Tottenham v Manchester United.\nFlorin Andone is the first Romanian to score in the Premier League since Vlad Chiriches netted for Tottenham against Fulham in December 2013.\n'We made the extra man show' - what the managers said\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"I have to have consistency in decisions and from my point of view this wasn't the case.\n\"I really like how my players fought and how they tried to keep their head high against all these decisions.\n\"This is for sure not easy but this will bring us even more together as a group to show everybody that it's important. You only want the feeling you get judged fair and this wasn't the case today.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"We were good after conceding the early goal. When they went down to 10 men you have to try and capitalise on that. It was completely different this week. We played against 10 men last week and didn't do enough on the ball but we did today.\n\"It is difficult when you are the team with 11 men but we made the extra man show and Florin Andone's goal was excellent.\n\"It is an important three points away from home.

He was very upset with himself last week.\"\nJamie Vardy's first-half penalty had put Leicester ahead, with the forward converting from the spot for the second week running after being brought down by Foster.\nWhile the visitors created a series of chances, their day went from bad to worse in the second half with midfielder Etienne Capoue dismissed for a two-footed tackle on Kelechi Iheanacho late on - a decision the Hornets say they will appeal.\nThe result leaves Watford, who have won just twice in their past 10 fixtures, in 10th while Leicester move up to eighth.\nWatford fans thanked for Srivaddhanaprabha banners\nIncisive Leicester cut through\nWhile Watford dominated possession with 62% it was the hosts who demonstrated the greater attacking thrust, largely thanks to the pace and movement of their front four.\nWhile Nampalys Mendy and Wilfred Ndidi laid the platform in midfield, the quartet of Vardy, Maddison, Albrighton and Demarai Gray prospered on the counter-attack.\nVardy's run off the shoulder of Watford defenders Craig Cathcart and Adrian Mariappa resulted in Foster clattering in to him for the Leicester penalty - the 13th the former England forward has converted out of 15 attempts in the top flight.\nAnd a sweeping riposte initiated by Maddison from a Watford attack then brought the second goal, with Vardy turning Mariappa and Albrighton picking out the midfielder, who had raced 50 yards to receive his pass.\nLeicester continued in the same vein after the break.\nContent to soak up pressure, Ricardo Pereira's surge forward from full-back then released Gray, who smashed his shot against the post.\nWatford fail to fire\nWatford manager Javi Gracia had suggested his team needed to rediscover their cutting edge in the build-up to this game.\nBut having managed just one goal in their previous three matches, there were few signs his players were close to recovering their goal-scoring instincts at the King Power Stadium.\nInstead it was more of the same for the Hornets, who also have a question mark over their form on the road, with this defeat their 14th in their past 19 matches away from Vicarage Road.\nTop scorer Roberto Pereyra's form is symptomatic of those troubles.\nFour of the five goals scored by the Argentine this season have been at home and he passed up a glorious chance to reduce the gap early in the second half.\nBut he was not the only one guilty of wasting opportunities.\nIsaac Success fired over when through on goal and substitute Andre Gray missed three excellent chances as Gracia's team battled in vain to retrieve the two-goal deficit.\n\"We created the chances but we didn't shoot on target. We need to improve these situations. We are losing points because we are not efficient,\" said Gracia.\nMan of the match - James Maddison (Leicester City)\nPenalty-winner Vardy - the stats\nLeicester City have won all five of their home Premier League matches against Watford, scoring 10 goals and conceding just once.\nWatford have won just one of their past 12 away matches at the King Power Stadium against Leicester in all competitions (D2 L9), a 2-1 victory in April 2013 in the Championship.\nSince the start of the 2014-15 season, Jamie Vardy has won more penalties in the Premier League than any other player (14).\nAll three of Vardy's Premier League goals against Watford have been at the King Power Stadium.\nJames Maddison has been directly involved in four goals in his six Premier League home games for Leicester this season, scoring three and assisting one.\nWatford's Etienne Capoue was sent off in a league game in Europe's top five divisions for the first time since May 2013 for Toulouse versus Sochaux.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Fulham on Wednesday 5 December (19:45 GMT) for their next Premier League fixture while Watford host leaders Manchester City on Tuesday 4 December (20:000 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-1 Bournemouth: Sterling and Gundogan end Cherries resistance\nManchester City had to work hard to see off a determined Bournemouth side before Raheem Sterling and Ilkay Gundogan secured the win that sends them five points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nCity's victory maintains their 100% home record in the league this season, with eight wins out of eight, but this latest triumph was not as straightforward as the scoreline might suggest.\nAll seemed to be going to plan for Pep Guardiola's side when Bernardo Silva smashed them ahead early on, with the Portuguese midfielder following up after Asmir Begovic had denied Leroy Sane.\nBut the home side, with David Silva on the bench and top scorer Sergio Aguero absent altogether after he complained of a muscle discomfort, relaxed a little too much before half-time and were deservedly punished.\nTo the displeasure of the home fans, the Cherries were given far too much time and space to build outside the box and Simon Francis swung in a perfect cross for Callum Wilson to rise and head home.\nBournemouth threatened again after half-time when King's looping cross almost dropped in at the far post, while City looked surprisingly short of urgency or inspiration.\nIt was Sterling who supplied the spark they were missing, to continue his remarkable run of scoring against the Cherries.\nThe England forward followed up after Begovic could only parry Danilo's low shot and Nathan Ake failed to clear, firing into the roof of the net for his 10th goal in seven games against the Cherries.\nBournemouth, looking to avoid a fourth successive defeat, did not lie down and some dangerous balls into the box ensured some nervous moments for the Etihad faithful.\nIt took Gundogan's close-range finish to make sure of the points with 11 minutes remaining, with the impressive Sane providing the assist with a precise pull-back.\n\"[Bournemouth] are a good side, so strong up front, so we could not press,\" Guardiola said. \"They played long balls, attacked the channels. They were taller than us and stronger than us.\n\"In the last 20 minutes we were flat, we did not have the rhythm we needed. Winning that way, we suffered a lot in the first half, especially in the last 20 minutes. That is why I am delighted to win in that way.\"\nRelive Manchester v Bournemouth\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nCity must hope Aguero absence is a short one\nThis is the start of a punishing six-week schedule that sees City play 13 games in the space of 44 days, including every midweek and weekend in December.\nSo it was perhaps not surprising that Guardiola chose to shuffle his squad, with five changes from the midweek draw with Lyon. Although the omission of Aguero was forced upon him.\nWith seven goals in his past 10 games, the Argentina striker has been in prolific form in recent weeks, and he was the player City missed more than most here.\nGuardiola revealed he might once again be without his leading striker for next Tuesday's match at Watford.\n\"I don't know if Aguero will be fit,\" the Spaniard said. \"We will see. I base my decisions on doctors, physios, instinct and what I see.\"\nBefore Saturday, City's attack had been even more lethal than the same stage last season, with more shots and shots on target than in 2017-18.\nBut their attacks were strangely short of an end product for almost an hour of this game, and the home crowd were beginning to voice their frustration until Sterling struck.\n'Sterling is the best player in the Premier League right now'\nFormer England and Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas hailed City's midfielder following his exceptional display on Saturday.\n\"We thought last season he was absolutely outstanding and he's kicked on again,\" Jenas told BBC's Match of the Day.\n\"There was no Sergio Aguero at all today, no David Silva, from the start - players the team would turn to. Sterling has now become one of them.\n\"He seems to enjoy it - he grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck in the second half. He drove at the defence, he put the fear into defenders.\n\"He's the best player in the Premier League right now - the way he is playing, I don't think anybody will dispute that.\"\nBournemouth get their game-plan right\nBournemouth had been beaten heavily on each of their three previous visits to the Etihad, conceding a total of 13 goals.\nBut Cherries boss Eddie Howe did much better with his approach this time, with his side well organised at the back and frequently breaking forward dangerously too.\n\"I think it is the closest we have come [to matching Manchester City at the Etihad],\" Howe said.\n\"I don't know if it is the best we have performed. I still don't think we have fully delivered a performance that we are truly capable of here but think that is the closest we have come.\"\nThey had already got in some good positions without finding the right final ball when Wilson rose to power his header home, and continued to look dangerous with the score at 1-1.\nCity are the only Premier League team not to have dropped any points this season from winning positions, but that scenario looked a distinct possibility until Sterling struck.\nEven then, the Cherries did not crumble. Four successive defeats have taken the shine off Bournemouth's strong start to the season, but this performance should give them some belief that they can stay in the top half of the table.\n\"I think we limited them in terms of clear cut chances today and I think the goals came at bad times for us but don't think we looked too vulnerable,\" Howe added.\n\"Yes, they had a lot of the ball but it was in front of us and we were happy with that. But we had some good moments on the counter attack and a lot of opportunities from set-pieces.\n\"There were just a couple of moments that just went against us - it's the closest we have come.\"\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Man City)\nInvolved in two of City's three goals and only denied one himself by Asmir Begovic's superb late stop, the German winger's desire did not dip even when his side let Bournemouth back in the game.\nHis all-round action-packed display was epitomised by his dash back to dispossess Joshua King as the Cherries threatened on the break.\nFormer Premier League midfielder Danny Murphy on MOTD:\nSane was incredible to watch, maybe he's had a point to prove, there have been question marks over his character and personality. What I saw is a player who is hungry, working hard both ways. He's devastating.\nHe has the desire to work hard, that's what Pep wants. Bournemouth couldn't cope with him. He was too good for them. We have eulogised over so many City players but I had to pick him out. He's so young there is more to come, it is incredible. He was fantastic.\nSane's spark for City - the stats\nCity have now gone 20 games unbeaten in the Premier League (W17 D3) since a 2-3 defeat by Manchester United in April\nBournemouth are yet to win a League match against Man City. In 13 meetings they've drawn twice and lost 11 times\nSince the start of last season, Man City's Leroy Sane has provided more assists in the Premier League than any other player with 20\nRaheem Sterling became the first Premier League player to score in his first six appearances for a club against a single opponent\nBournemouth's Callum Wilson has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last 15 Premier League appearances (8 goals, 4 assists)\nMan City's Bernardo Silva has been directly involved in six goals in his last eight Premier League games (three goals, three assists)\nWhat's next?\nCity travel to Watford on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) looking for their seventh successive Premier League win.\nBournemouth host Huddersfield on the same night (19:45) looking for their first league victory since 27 October."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-0 Burnley: Wilfried Zaha stars as Eagles earn first home win\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche says his team have lost their \"eye of the tiger\" following their defeat by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.\nThe Clarets, without a win in seven matches, did not deserve to take anything from the game and have dropped to 19th in the Premier League after Southampton drew 2-2 with Manchester United in Saturday's 17:30 GMT kick-off.\nPalace's first home victory of the season saw them end a run of eight league games without a win and move up three places to 14th.\n\"The best side won, simple as that,\" Dyche told BBC Sport. \"We are in the position where the eye of the tiger has gone. Last season everyone was on it.\n\"To get the eye of the tiger back, a boxer has to get back in the gym. We've got to get back on the training ground and work hard.\n\"It's frustrating, they have given so much to the cause but then fear comes in, it's a tough thing. It plays tricks with you, and players get stretched as individuals.\"\nThe Eagles took the lead early on when James McArthur's low cross eluded everyone to drift in at the back post, before Andros Townsend added a second with a superb left-footed drive 12 minutes from time.\nIt could have been worse for Burnley, who had Joe Hart to thank for a number of fine saves, while Palace missed several good chances prior to Townsend's stunner.\nRelive how Palace beat Burnley\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nImpressive Eagles claim deserved victory\nPrior to Saturday's result, the Selhurst Park season-ticket holders had not witnessed a home win since the final game of 2017-18 - but it was worth the wait.\nGiven the way Palace started the game, it was difficult to believe they had only claimed two points at home prior to this match.\nRoy Hodgson's side dominated from the first whistle, with Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend doing the bulk of the damage.\nThey deservedly - and perhaps fortunately - took the lead on 16 minutes thanks to McArthur's intended cross from the left, but they could have gone ahead earlier.\nCheikhou Kouyate was inches away from tapping in a Zaha cross on four minutes, and Hart had to be at his best shortly after when he tipped Max Meyer's curling effort round a post.\nThe Eagles missed a spate of chances in the second period - with Meyer, Luka Milivojevic, Zaha, Townsend and Patrick van Aanholt all guilty parties.\nIt felt like they could pay for their poor finishing, but Townsend's goal-of-the-month contender made the result safe late on.\n\"I don't think we are as bad as our position would suggest, and I think our performance today showed that,\" Hodgson told BBC Sport.\n\"It was a game we needed to win, but though we haven't played that badly, we have not taken the points.\"\nZaha shines brightest for Palace\nFollowing his return from injury at Old Trafford last Saturday, Zaha was back to his brilliant best against the Clarets.\nThe Ivorian forward was a constant menace, using his pace and trickery to put Burnley's defenders on the back foot throughout.\nHe was also able to bring his team-mates into the game, too, linking up particularly well with Meyer and Van Aanholt, who charged forward from left-back at every opportunity.\nThe only thing missing from his performance was a goal.\nThat's not to say he didn't have chances. On multiple occasions he was able to weave his way into the Clarets' box, only to find Hart or a despairing block in his way.\nAlthough his lack of end product may be a slight concern for Hodgson, it must not take away from a masterful overall performance.\nBurnley's awful form continues\nBurnley failed to register a victory in either October or November and that dismal form continued into December.\nTheir winless run does include defeats by Chelsea and Manchester City, but nonetheless it illustrates the rut Dyche's side find themselves in.\nThe Clarets offered little. Their first shot did not come until the 65th minute, and even then Johann Berg Gudmundsson's effort was easily blocked.\nThey finished with four shots - none of which were on target - and Palace had 29.\nJack Cork and Steven Defour were helpless to stop Meyer's runs from deep, while Eagles skipper Milivojevic was able to dictate play with ease.\nAt times, it looked like centre-back Kevin Long, who made six tackles and seven clearances, was the only man standing in the way of a marauding Palace front line.\nEngland centre-back James Tarkowski has recovered from a hernia operation and was named in the matchday squad for the first time since 3 November.\nBut it seems Burnley need more than a fit-again Tarkowski to fix a back line which has conceded 29 goals in 14 league games.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\n'Questions do get asked' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I'm delighted because we played very well, we have had teams on the rack at home and not got the win we needed, so it was good to get a win after a good performance.\n\"It's good to see the team playing well, and I didn't think we were going to relinquish our grip and let them back in. We did what we needed to do and I am delighted we won it with such a good goal.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche told BBC Sport: \"We have to be a team, and we are a bit stretched at the moment. The effort's good, but it's a bit misguided at the moment, we have to remind them how they can play.\n\"Questions do get asked, they are bound to - we are in a results business. There's work to be done, the players are involved in that work and they wish to be. But I have not forgotten how we got here and how we built it. I'm pretty level about that, but I know there is more needs to be done.\"\nShot-happy Palace - the stats\nCrystal Palace's 29 shots was the most they have had in any Premier League game since 2003-04.\nBurnley have claimed just two wins in their past 19 Premier League games (D5 L12), after winning five in a row before that run.\nPalace registered their first victory in their past nine Premier League games (D3 L5).\nBurnley haven't won any of their past 22 away top-flight matches in December (D7 L15) since a 1-0 win in December 1969 against West Bromwich Albion.\nIn league competition, Burnley have won just one of their past 13 away matches against Crystal Palace (D6 L6).\nCrystal Palace's Andros Townsend has scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for only the fourth time and the first since December 2017 (for Palace against Arsenal).\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to the Amex Stadium to face Brighton on Tuesday, 4 December (19:45 GMT).\nBurnley host Liverpool on Wednesday, 5 December (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 2-2 Manchester United: Romelu Lukaku scores in St Mary's draw\nManchester United are lacking in \"mad dogs\" in midfield, manager Jose Mourinho said after his side recovered from a terrible start but were still held to a disappointing draw at struggling Southampton.\nMourinho's side were facing an embarrassing defeat early on as the Saints went into a 2-0 lead inside the opening 20 minutes.\nMarcus Rashford inspired a comeback before half-time, with two goals in six minutes from Romelu Lukaku and Ander Herrera earning the visitors a point, but it was another unconvincing display.\nMourinho - who played two midfielders in a back three because of injury problems - bemoaned his side's inability to take control of the match.\n\"It doesn't matter the system we play,\" Mourinho said. \"(Not winning) has to do with the characteristics of the players.\n\"With all due respect, we don't have many mad dogs that bite the ball and press all the time. We don't have many people with that spirit.\"\nNeither side were able to mount any real pressure in the second half, with the draw leaving the Saints in the relegation zone in 18th with just one win in their past 15 Premier League games, including last season.\nMark Hughes' side will reflect on a costly capitulation at the end of the first half after fine goals from Stuart Armstrong and Cedric Soares had seemingly put them in control.\nUnited move seventh - still six points off a Champions League place and a massive 16 shy of the lead held by rivals Manchester City.\nMakeshift and make do?\nOn the face of it, this is a bad result for a Manchester United side harbouring hopes of a top-four finish - but it could have been worse, as a Southampton side with just one league win all season punished a sloppy opening.\nUnited have spent hundreds of millions of pounds under Mourinho but not for the first time this season started with a makeshift defence. Midfielders Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic started in a back three, with Marcos Rojo only deemed fit enough for a place on the bench.\nMcTominay and Jones seemed to be in each other's way in the build-up to the opener, as Republic of Ireland youngster Michael Obafemi rolled the ball into Armstrong's path, and the former Celtic man drilled a fine strike across David de Gea and in.\nSouthampton had scored with their first attempt of the match, and added a second shortly after when Rashford made a rash challenge on the edge of the area and right-back Soares marked his 100th Premier League appearance with a first goal, brilliantly curling beyond De Gea from 20 yards.\nUnited looked listless, but found the inspiration they were badly lacking in Rashford. First the 21-year-old collected a long ball, bounced through a half-hearted challenge from Maya Yoshida and laid a chance on a plate for Lukaku. Even without a club goal in 12 games and nearly three months, the Belgian couldn't miss.\nRashford then did even better shortly afterwards, beating three defenders on a surging run into the penalty area and finding Herrera at the near post, the Spaniard providing a clever backheeled finish under Alex McCarthy.\nBut that was where the excitement ended for United. In a largely lifeless second half their only shot on target was a tame overhead effort from Paul Pogba, and Mourinho's already stretched squad saw Luke Shaw, Rashford and Lukaku limp off late on, while Ashley Young picked up a fifth booking of the season which rules him out of Wednesday's league game at home to Arsenal.\n'Rashford was a mad dog'\n\"I would say Marcus Rashford was a mad dog,\" Mourinho added.\n\"He was, let's say, very, very tired with little problems. That appetite, that desire, that fire that you have, you need that to recover the ball faster and to recover the ball higher on the pitch, but these are just details.\n\"He was injured, he was asking to come off. Some players with that kind of injury do not play for two weeks, but Marcus no, Marcus I am pretty sure he will be fine for the next one. It is one kick here, one kick there, one fall here, one fall there, fatigue, lots of running, lots of movement, 75 minutes and he was done.\"\nSaints squander another lead\nHughes said that he was \"really pleased\" with the point, but the former United forward has now won just three of his 21 league games in charge of the Saints, who stay in the relegation zone on nine points.\nThey have now squandered a league-high 12 points from winning positions this season, a statistic that could have telling consequences later on in the season.\nThe hosts were the better side in the second half, with the impressive Nathan Redmond forcing De Gea into a sharp save from long range, but they never really looked like forcing a much-needed winner.\n\"When you look at our performance and the table, we are not where we want to be. Are we under-performing compared to last year? Probably not,\" Hughes said.\n\"We have to get maximum points in games, everybody saw by the manner of our performance that we are a good side, we just have to keep working and performing.\"\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy on MOTD:\nRashford took responsibility in this game and if it wasn't for him United wouldn't have come back. Relying on a young player is wrong but he got them a point.\n'Forget about the league table'\nManchester United midfielder Ander Herrera said: \"We should forget right now about the table, we should try to win every game. That's how we will reach the top four.\n\"We should approach the Arsenal game like a final.\n\"It's two points dropped, but apart from that we can build from what we did after they scored the second goal.\"\nNo home joy for Saints - the stats\nSouthampton remain the only team in the Premier League yet to win a home game this season (D5 L2).\nMark Hughes has won just three of his past 25 Premier League games as a manager in the competition (W3 D9 L13).\nCedric Soares is the seventh player to score a direct free-kick for Southampton in the Premier League and first since James Ward-Prowse versus West Brom in February 2018.\nRomelu Lukaku's strike versus Southampton has ended a run of 12 games and 981 minutes without a goal for Manchester United in all competitions since netting against Watford in September.\nWhat's next?\nIt doesn't get any easier for Southampton, who travel to Wembley to take on Tottenham on Wednesday (20:00 GMT). Mourinho and United host old foes Arsenal on the same evening, also 20:00."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-0 Fulham: Blues hold off spirited Cottagers to go third\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri said Claudio Ranieri can \"have a very great impact\" at Fulham after his team overcame a spirited Cottagers side to claim a valuable victory at Stamford Bridge.\nRanieri was appointed Fulham boss on 14 November after Slavisa Jokanovic was sacked and the Italian guided his new team to victory over Southampton in his first game in charge last Saturday.\nHowever, despite a brave second-half performance, his Cottagers were unable to breach the Chelsea defence and they fell to defeat through goals from Pedro and Ruben Loftus-Cheek either side of the break.\n\"Today was about the result - we gave more attention to the defensive phase to get the win,\" Sarri told Sky Sports.\n\"Now we have to start to improve and play our football in a better way.\n\"Ranieri can have a very great impact at Fulham, in two or three weeks they will defend very well and in a month, playing against them will be a problem for any team.\"\nThe Blues took the lead early on when Pedro slotted home from N'Golo Kante's pass and they could have had more in the first half had Sergio Rico not twice denied Olivier Giroud.\nFulham threatened to find an equaliser in the second half as Chelsea struggled for fluency, but substitute Loftus-Cheek made the win safe when he fired past Rico after an intricate passing move with Eden Hazard and Pedro.\nDefeat for Fulham means they stay bottom of the table, having claimed only one point from a possible 24 away from home this season.\nRanieri, who managed Chelsea between 2000 and 2004, believed his team deserved a draw.\n\"We wanted to play football but we made mistakes and against big champions you pay everything for that,\" Ranieri told BBC Sport.\n\"In the second half we changed system and maybe we deserved to draw the match. I am satisfied with how my players made decisions with the ball. We played together strongly and created good chances.\"\nBlues' unbeaten home run continues\nChelsea bounced back from defeat by Tottenham with an emphatic 4-0 Europa League win over PAOK Salonika on Thursday, and they followed that up with another, albeit more laboured, victory against Fulham.\nIt took Pedro just four minutes to break the deadlock as he tucked away Chelsea's 1,000th Premier League goal at Stamford Bridge and that set the tone for the first half.\nThe hosts dominated possession in the first half and they could have easily had a second on 24 minutes when Giroud, who netted a double in midweek, saw his low effort blocked by Rico.\nAnd the Spain goalkeeper was there to foil the Frenchman again on the brink of half-time, as he saved Giroud's sliding effort from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross.\nHowever, Sarri's team were unable to play with the same fluidity in the second period and they did not seriously test Rico again until Marcos Alonso's whipped free-kick was saved on the hour mark.\nSecond-half substitute Alvaro Morata then wasted an excellent opportunity after 73 minutes when he fired over with the goal gaping after Rico had parried Hazard's low strike.\nBut fellow replacement Loftus-Cheek was on hand to net Chelsea's second of the game, and his fifth in his past six games, with eight minutes remaining.\nThe Blues' victory means they are now unbeaten at Stamford Bridge in 14 matches in all competitions, a run which stretches back to April.\nSpirited Fulham fall short\nBefore Sunday's game, the Cottagers had claimed just one point from a possible 21 in away games this season, and disappointingly for new boss Ranieri, they were unable to buck the trend at Stamford Bridge.\nThere were promising moments for the visitors early on, even after Chelsea's first goal, but neither Cyrus Christie nor Calum Chambers could seriously test Kepa Arrizabalaga, shooting straight at the Spaniard.\nBut it was only after Ranieri introduced Aboubakar Kamara and Floyd Ayite at half-time that his side began to pose a serious threat.\nKamara's low cross was nearly deflected into the Chelsea net by Antonio Rudiger, and Kepa had to make a fine save to keep out Chambers' header from the resulting corner.\nAnd the Arsenal loanee drew another good save from Kepa shortly after, as the Spaniard dived to his right to beat away Chambers' curling effort.\nHowever, despite the Cottagers' best efforts, they were unable to put their hosts under a sustained period of pressure, and Chelsea held on to claim consecutive home clean sheets for the first time this season.\nMeanwhile, Fulham are the only side in England's top four tiers who are yet to keep a clean sheet in 2018-19.\nMan of the match - Calum Chambers\n'He will be very important for us in the future' - what they said\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri on BBC Sport: \"We can't do much about the game against Tottenham - we played very badly and lost the game. Today was difficult, we started well and we had a good level of application.\n\"We created some opportunities for 2-0 but missed them - we were in control of the match and I was afraid only because I saw that the team were a bit tense. The last 15 minutes could have been a problem but then we scored.\n\"Ruben Loftus-Cheek played very well in the Europa League and I am very happy with him. Today Mateo Kovacic had a knock to his ankle so he came on, it is not a problem to play with him. He is improving and he will be very important for us in the future.\"\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri to Sky Sports: \"We played so so in the first half, we made a mistake for the first goal but we were much better in the second. We made chances but when you play big champions they can do that. It was a positive match for us, we are improving.\n\"It will be very emotional for me to play Leicester on Wednesday, but it is very important for us. I am positive.\"\nChelsea leave it late (again) - the stats\nChelsea have scored 12 goals (out of their 30) in the final 15 minutes of games in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nChelsea haven't lost any of their last 11 home games in the Premier League (W6 D5) - their longest unbeaten run at Stamford Bridge in the competition since August 2015 (a run of 21 games).\nFulham have conceded 35 goals in the Premier League this season - their joint-most after 14 games of a top-flight league campaign (35 in 1959-60).\nChelsea are unbeaten in their previous 17 Premier League games against Fulham (W10 D7), winning each of the last four.\nThis was the 14th time that a former Chelsea manager has returned to Stamford Bridge in a Premier League game and failed to win (D5 L9), with this being Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri's third such attempt (D1 L2).\nPedro's opener for Chelsea was their 1000th home goal in the Premier League, becoming just the third club to reach this landmark in the competition after Manchester United and Arsenal.\nChelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has scored five goals in his last six appearances in all competitions for Chelsea, including in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time.\nN'Golo Kante has as many Premier League assists this season (2) as he managed in his previous two league campaigns for Chelsea combined.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Molineux to face Wolves on Wednesday, 5 December (19:45 GMT), and Fulham host Leicester the same day (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 4-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Unai Emery praises 'special' comeback\nArsenal's relentless attacking performance to overpower Tottenham was a \"special\" moment, says Unai Emery.\nHis side extended their unbeaten run to 19 matches, moving above Spurs into the top four, with a display that reflected the outstanding work the Spaniard has done since succeeding Arsene Wenger.\nDespite his satisfaction at beating their arch-rivals in his first north London derby, Emery has challenged his players to continue improving.\n\"It is a very big victory; we showed our supporters and we gave them the victory because it is a very special match against Tottenham, for us it is special also,\" the Arsenal manager said.\n\"But above all it is three points, like against Bournemouth last weekend.\n\"We need to continue our process, creating our way. I want to do more.\"\n'Emery has blown winds of change through Arsenal like a hurricane'\nArrest after banana skin thrown at derby\nArsenal's fast start drew early reward when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put them ahead from the spot after Jan Vertonghen's handball.\nYet Spurs, against the run of play, were ahead before the break. Eric Dier glanced home Christian Eriksen's free-kick to equalise, sparking a melee involving players from both sides with his celebrations in front of Arsenal's fans, before Harry Kane scored from the spot after Rob Holding was penalised for a challenge on Son Heung-min.\nEmery introduced Alexandre Lacazette and Aaron Ramsey at the start of the second half to dramatic effect.\nThe Welshman set up Aubameyang's magnificent finish and the France striker's deflected shot beat goalkeeper Hugo Lloris from the edge of the area to put Arsenal ahead with 16 minutes left.\nThe outstanding Lucas Torreira ran clear to wrap up Arsenal's win and Spurs' misery was complete when Vertonghen was sent off for a foul on Lacazette.\n\"Until they scored the third goal I think the game was even, after that we started to pay,\" Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said.\n\"It was difficult for the team to show the energy that we normally show.\"\nArsenal revival gathers pace\nThe manner in which Arsenal pressed and powered Spurs into submission here was remarkable but further evidence of their transformation under Emery.\nThe former Sevilla and Paris St-Germain manager has galvanised the club on and off the pitch after the stale end to the Wenger era. He was a constant blur of movement in his technical area almost guiding every move by hand.\nEmery has, crucially, made an instant connection with Arsenal's fans, regularly urging them to turn up the volume at moments when the stadium threatened to go quiet.\nArsenal simply refused to give an inch to Spurs and Emery was bold when Spurs led at half-time, sending on Lacazette and Ramsey.\nHis side had played well in the first half, but the changes gave them a turbo-charge.\nIt was said the true test of Emery's work would come when they faced their closest rivals. This was an examination they passed with flying colours.\nSpurs overpowered in their own style\nSpurs and manager Mauricio Pochettino have made their name with the intensity of their attacking, pressing style backed up by obvious quality.\nHere, however, they had all their own strengths turned back on them by Arsenal and almost seemed in a daze as they were swept aside in the latter stages.\nArsenal had Spurs in trouble instantly and barely let go, even when Dier and Kane somehow had the visitors going in at the interval ahead.\nSpurs could not create in attack, were impotent in midfield and vulnerable at the back where Vertonghen's uncomfortable afternoon saw him concede a penalty and receive a red card - while youngster Juan Foyth was punished for giving the ball away when Lacazette putting Arsenal in front.\nThey now lie outside the top four but will surely come again. Here, however, they were comprehensively outplayed.\nTorreira every inch a bargain\nTorreira confirmed his status as a new Arsenal hero when he advanced into the penalty area to drill in his first goal for the club and secure this outstanding victory.\nThe Uruguay international, a \u00a326m buy from Sampdoria in July, celebrated his goal by throwing off his shirt in front of exultant Arsenal fans.\nHe is tenacious and fierce in the tackle but brings so much more with his game. He has silk as well as steel, refusing to flinch from the physical exchanges here, yet always willing to create.\nTorreira may not have been the most expensive piece of business conducted in the summer market but he looks one of the smartest.\nMan of the match - Lucas Torreira (Arsenal)\nArsenal show new-found resilience - key stats\nThe last time Arsenal won a north London derby in the Premier League after trailing at half time was in September 2007 - a 3-1 victory.\nThey have scored more second-half goals than any other side in the Premier League this season (24).\nIf Premier League matches finished at half-time this season, Arsenal would be 19th in the table.\nArsenal have found the net at least once in each of their past 23 home games against Spurs in all competitions, since a goalless draw in November 1998.\nTottenham have dropped more points from winning positions in Premier League games against Arsenal than any side has against another in the competition (40).\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the first player to score with 10 consecutive shots on target in the Premier League since Blackburn's Benni McCarthy in October 2007.\nSince his debut in the Premier League in February, only Mohamed Salah (20) has scored as many goals in the competition as Aubameyang (20).\nNo player has scored more Premier League north London derby goals than Harry Kane, was had eight - putting him level with Emmanuel Adebayor.\nWhat's next?\nA two-day break and then back to Premier League action on Wednesday.\nArsenal face another game against fierce rivals when they visit Manchester United at 20:00 GMT, while Tottenham host struggling Southampton at Wembley at the same time."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 1-0 Everton: Jordan Pickford error gifts Divock Origi late winner\nLiverpool's Divock Origi scored a bizarre 96th-minute goal in sensational circumstances as a terrible Jordan Pickford error gifted the Reds victory over Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.\nIt sent his manager Jurgen Klopp sprinting onto the pitch to hug goalkeeper Alisson and the fans into raptures, but was cruel on Everton, who had at times played the more adventurous football in a lively encounter.\nThe 232nd meeting between the city rivals was heading for a draw when Pickford mishandled a sliced Virgil van Dijk shot that had ballooned high up into the air.\nIt seemed set to land on top of his net, but the England keeper clawed the ball back down from above his crossbar and spilled it out to Origi.\nA late substitute making his first Premier League appearance since August 2017, all the Belgian striker had to do was nod into an empty goal to secure a win that consolidates Liverpool's second place, two points behind defending champions Manchester City.\nIn the 87th-minute Origi had missed what looked to be the golden late chance to seal victory when he smashed against the bar from three yards, unable to convert a ball bouncing loose from a corner.\nIt was Origi's third goal against Everton - his best record against any side for Liverpool.\nAnd it was the fifth Premier League injury-time winner Liverpool have scored against Everton - again, they have not scored more against any other side in the Premier League era.\nThe Toffees remain without a victory in their past 18 meetings with the Reds, and are winless at Anfield this century.\nThey stay sixth in the table, eight points below Tottenham in fifth and Arsenal in fourth.\nFootball Daily: Pickford's derby day debacle\nRelive Liverpool's stunning late win against Everton\nI don't understand how he thinks he can catch that - Wright\nChances spurned until late, late drama\nLiverpool had been intensifying their search for a winner, while Everton continued to threaten themselves late on, but nobody was expecting the match to be settled in the manner it was.\nThe main themes before Pickford's nightmare moment were fine goalkeeping and repeated wastefulness.\nIn the game's early stages, Yerry Mina headed wide for Everton when he had a clear sight of goal, before Liverpool's Sadio Mane fired over from close range.\nAlisson was forced into two vital first-half stops for the hosts, the first from point-blank range to keep out Andre Gomes' header, with Joe Gomez clearing the rebound off the line and Gylfi Sigurdsson only able to force the ball onto the post and behind as he followed in.\nThen the Brazilian keeper came sprawling off his line to deny Theo Walcott, who found himself clear on goal from Sigurdsson's masterful through ball, while Pickford expertly blocked Xherdan Shaqiri in a one-on-one shortly after.\nFollowing the break, Mane fired off target twice more from good positions, the first in another one-on-one when his manager already had his fists clenched ready to punch the air in celebration.\nBut Klopp would finally get the chance to let his emotions out as he burst onto the pitch in celebration of Origi's goal - his first for Liverpool since May 2017.\n'Completely wrong' - criticism for Klopp\nEx-England defender Danny Mills, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live\nKlopp would be lucky not to be running past me if I was playing in that game. But that's the sort of problems it can cause.\nI just think it's completely wrong. You cannot go on to the middle of the pitch, no matter what the circumstances.\nThere are so many managers that get absolutely hammered but Klopp is very media friendly, everybody seems to love him and he can't do anything wrong.\nCruel on impressive Everton\nThere are still positives for Everton to take from this cruel defeat.\nLiverpool have only conceded once at home in the league this season, so they are not alone in being unable to breach Alisson's goal, and Pickford's mistake is all the more shocking because of his otherwise solid performances for club and country.\nAt times, Everton played the more adventurous football. With Liverpool sometimes lacking their usual zip, Gomes, Bernard and England Under-21 forward Ademola Lookman all impressed in blue.\nNever in the 124-year history of meetings between these two sides has an Everton boss won their first league match against Liverpool at Anfield.\nSilva, who had won one and drawn one of his previous two meetings with Liverpool as a manager, might have been dreaming of achieving the feat with the outcome still in the balance with minutes to play.\nTim Cahill and Mikel Arteta were on the scoresheet for Everton the last time the Toffees beat Liverpool - a 2-0 home victory on 17 October 2010.\nTheir most recent victory at Anfield was courtesy of a Kevin Campbell winner in September 1999. They remain winless in 19 trips, but this was a hugely encouraging performance. The result just did not match it.\nKlopp's apology - what the managers said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"First of all I have to apologise for my run. I apologised immediately after to Marco Silva, I didn't want to be disrespectful.\n\"My respect to Everton could not be bigger after that game. We knew how strong they were but today they were outstandingly strong and difficult with the way they played.\n\"The goal was lucky of course but our idea was clear: we wanted to win until the last second. We wanted to show that by bringing strikers on. It was a long and open game. I think we deserved the three points.\"\nEverton manager Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It was a tough match and a tough result for us. We don't deserve to lose. We had the better chances to score but that is football. It is our life. That goal you cannot expect to happen.\n\"The players understand they deserved something more. We started the match together and that is how we end it. We will be in this way and do everything to win the next match. All the support I can give to Jordan, I will. He is a very good goalkeeper. He did not expect that situation.\n\"We are improving and we did again this afternoon even if the result wasn't what we wanted or deserved. I am proud of my players and what they are doing. Nobody in the stadium expected that moment. The way they celebrated it showed to me how difficult it was for them.\"\nMan of the match - Andre Gomes (Everton)\nLiverpool's defensive mettle - the stats\nLiverpool have conceded just five goals in their first 14 Premier League games this season; only Chelsea in 2008-09 conceded fewer at this stage with four\nEverton's Theo Walcott has played 395 minutes at Anfield in the Premier League without scoring - the most he has played at any stadium without ever finding the net\nLiverpool's unbeaten run of 18 matches against Everton in all competitions (W9 D9) is their longest unbeaten run against their rivals\nLiverpool have recorded 11 clean sheets in the Premier League so far in 2018 at Anfield; only in 2002 and 2006 have the Reds kept more (12)\nLiverpool's Roberto Firmino has failed to score in his past nine Premier League games at Anfield - the Brazilian's longest drought at home in the competition\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool next play in the Premier League away at 19th-placed Burnley. who are without a win in seven games.

It gets us on our feet again and looking forward.\"\nBournemouth went ahead after five minutes as Wilson muscled home a powerful header from Fraser's cross.\nWilson returned the favour soon after, slipping in Fraser for a well-worked second.\nHuddersfield rallied with Terence Kongolo's first goal for the club halving the deficit before the interval.\nAaron Mooy shot low into the shins of goalkeeper Asmir Begovic from the best chance created during a spell of pressure on the other side of the break, but the Terriers left themselves with too much to do.\nBournemouth's win lifts them above Leicester, Manchester United and Everton, all of whom play on Wednesday.\nFootball Daily podcast: Man City wobble but win, daft red cards and testimonial-intensity Pogba\nCherries get their work done early\nThe hosts' recent poor results did not reflect the quality of their performances in single-goal defeats by Arsenal, Newcastle and Manchester United, and last weekend's 3-1 reverse at Manchester City.\nCertainly Huddersfield, perched perilously one point above the relegation zone, struggled to contain the intelligent and incisive home attack early on.\nWilson, who scored a hat-trick in this fixture last year, found the Terriers defence in accommodating mood once again as he beat the offside trap and buried a header after just five minutes.\nFraser came close to providing a second shortly after, picking out Joshua King in the box, before bursting up the left to supply a side-foot finish to a slide-rule Wilson pass.\nIt perhaps came a little too easily for the hosts, who slipped deep and switched off early in the second half. An increasingly edgy Vitality Stadium greeted the final whistle with relief.\nHuddersfield into double figures at last\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner was left ruing his side's slow start.\n\"The goals we gave away were too easy and the opportunities we missed were presents. It was Christmas for Bournemouth,\" said the German in his post-match interview.\nBefore kick-off, Howe had pin-pointed the visitors' size and strength as a potential danger and 'Route One' almost provided a comeback trail for the Terriers.\nHuddersfield began the evening as the only team in the top four divisions yet to reach double figures in the goals scored column and, with striker Steve Mounie suspended, their entire three-man defence combined to finally wipe out that statistic.\nKongolo jumped well to direct home a header, ending a passage of penalty area head tennis involving Christopher Schindler and Mathias Jorgensen.\nThe visitors penned Bournemouth deep and ushered forward more heavy artillery as the second half wore on, but, Mooy's chance apart, struggled to carve out any clear sights of goal.\nTo add to their disappointment, substitute Abdelhamid Sabiri suffered a serious looking shoulder injury only three minutes after coming on. It was the 22-year-old's first Premier League appearance since August.\nMan of the match - Nathan Ake (Bournemouth)\n'There is a lot of relief' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"There is a lot of relief. It wasn't a vintage performance. At 2-0 you think we can go on but Huddersfield did very well and created chances. We defended heroically.\n\"Football doesn't work kindly and credit to Huddersfield. They can feel hard done by.\n\"The manner of the defensive mentality and will to win when not playing well - we had that to get us over the line.\"\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"We dominated the game in large parts and created chances. I have to say it was a free-kick to us before we conceded the first. But we only have to blame us. We have to make sure defensively in these situations we are more focused. Offensively we need to put our chances away.\n\"We had enough opportunities to score at least two. We needed to score three or four today. We didn't take them and that is why we have no rewards.\"\nFraser's record-equalling season - the stats\nBournemouth are unbeaten in seven home matches against Huddersfield in all competitions, winning four and drawing three, since losing 1-0 in League One in August 2007.\nSince the start of last season, only Brighton (17) and Watford (16) have lost more away Premier League games than Huddersfield (15).\nHuddersfield have won just two of their past 19 Premier League games (drawing six and losing 11).\nKongolo's goal for Huddersfield was their fourth headed goal in the Premier League this season (4/10) - only Burnley (46%) and Newcastle (55%) have scored a higher percentage of headed goals in the competition this season.\nFraser has provided seven Premier League assists for Bournemouth so far this season - more than any other player has provided for the Cherries in a single Premier League campaign.\nWilson has scored eight Premier League goals in 15 appearances for Bournemouth this season - as many as his managed in 28 games last season.\nWilson has both scored and assisted in three different Premier League games this season (level with Raheem Sterling) - no player has done this on more occasions this season.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth entertain Liverpool at 12:30 GMT on Saturday with Huddersfield away to Arsenal at 15:00 GMT on the same day."

We know why we brought him here,\" said Pellegrini.\n\"Lucas played very well.

        "article_text": "Brighton 3-1 Crystal Palace: Ten-man Seagulls sweep Eagles aside\nBrighton produced one of the best Premier League performances of the season to sweep aside Crystal Palace despite playing for 62 minutes with only 10 men.\nMoments after the Seagulls went 1-0 up through Glenn Murray's spot-kick, defender Shane Duffy was sent off for thrusting his head at Patrick van Aanholt after referee Kevin Friend had turned down a second penalty appeal.\nPlaymaker Pascal Gross was immediately replaced by the more defensive-minded Leon Balogun, and the substitute's first touch was a stunning strike to double the home side's lead.\nThe best was yet to come for the hosts, as Florin Andone ran 40 yards down the left to fire in the third goal in first-half stoppage time. The Romanian forward had only been on the pitch for 14 minutes, having replaced the injured Murray.\nHome goalkeeper Mat Ryan had little to do until the 81st minute, when he was beaten by Luka Milivojevic's penalty.\nChris Hughton's side managed to subdue Palace's attack in the remaining minutes to record a memorable win.\nFootball Daily podcast: Man City wobble but win, daft red cards and testimonial-intensity Pogba\nSeagulls defy odds after losing Duffy\nBrighton fans will remember this M23 derby for a very long time.\nIn teeming rain at Amex Stadium they witnessed their side reduced to 10 men in the 28th minute, score three times, and comfortably keep their arch-rivals at bay.\nAfter an underwhelming start, the Seagulls were awarded a penalty when James McArthur brought down Jose Izquierdo. Murray fired the resulting spot-kick in off the bar for his sixth goal in seven home league games this season.\nThe veteran striker's evening ended a few minutes later, when he injured a shoulder in a challenge with James Tomkins in the Palace area. Friend turned down the subsequent penalty appeal, after which Duffy was sent off for his clash with Van Aanholt.\nThe gloom among the home support turned to cheers within seconds, when Balogun volleyed in with his first touch. That finish was excellent, but Andone's effort just before the break was stunning.\nThe Romanian, a summer signing who scored in the win over Huddersfield last weekend, collected a long punt on the left-hand side and raced Tomkins to the area. The Palace defender managed to nudge the ball, but only back into the path of Andone, who fired an angled shot past Wayne Hennessey.\nDespite losing one of their key defensive marshals in Duffy, Brighton's rearguard were rarely troubled by a Palace attack that lacked ideas.\nPalace waste golden opportunity\nEagles manager Roy Hodgson must be wondering how his side only managed to breach the last line of defence once with their numerical advantage.\nPrior to the penalty, the closest they came to a goal was when Bernardo cleared Milivojevic's shot off the line. The Serb did have more luck from the spot with nine minutes remaining, after Balogun had mistimed his tackle on Wilfried Zaha.\nThat was Zaha's biggest contribution to a match prior to which he had a tense encounter with a Brighton fan.\nMan of the match - Yves Bissouma (Brighton)\n'To get two wins on the spin is big for us' - the reaction\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"When it was 11 v 11 we were the best side. I thought we were outstanding. It's shame their penalty went in.\n\"There is no hiding place for what Duffy did. He knows better than that because he is an experienced international player.\n\"The second and third were big goals for us. The second was the one. It relieved pressure on us, then Andone's third was special. It showed real desire.\n\"Murray's shoulder is sore at the moment. We'll see how he is in the morning.\n\"You know a bad run can leave you four or five without a win. To get two wins on the spin is big for us. We thoroughly deserved it.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"We won the second half comfortably, but not by enough goals. I didn't have high hopes because I knew they would defend well. They came out deserved winners.\n\"Goals change things. It's different at 0-0. At 1-0 and 2-0 down other factors come in. Without watching the game back, I don't have a clear point to make about why this performance wasn't as good.\n\"A win and a good performance in one game doesn't give you the right to win the next one. At this level we take every game humbly. When we do win we are very happy, when we lose we are very unhappy. The adjectives after a while get wearying.\"\nAndone emulates former Wolves player - the stats\nBrighton's win is their first in a midweek Premier League match (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) - drawing three and losing three of the previous six.\nPalace have picked up just one point from their past five Premier League away games (D1 L4), scoring three goals and conceding 10.\nBrighton have lost just one of their past 10 Premier League games at Amex Stadium (W5 D4), winning three of their past four (D1).\nMurray has scored the opening goal in five different Premier League games this season - only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (six) has done so more.\nZaha has won more penalties (seven) and Milivojevic scored more (10) than any other players in the Premier League since last season.\nAndone is the first Romanian to score in consecutive Premier League appearances since Ionel Ganea in February 2004 - he scored against Arsenal and Leeds for Wolves.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton are at Burnley on Saturday, when Palace are at West Ham (both 15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-2 Manchester City: Leroy Sane and Riyad Mahrez give Premier League leaders hard-fought win\nManchester City's nervous finish in an otherwise comfortable win at Watford showed \"you can never relax in the Premier League\", according to manager Pep Guardiola.\nThe reigning champions had controlled Tuesday's game and led through goals from Leroy Sane and Riyad Mahrez but Abdoulaye Doucoure scrambled in for Watford in the 85th minute to give the hosts hope of an unlikely comeback.\nWatford sent goalkeeper Ben Foster forward for set-pieces in a frantic finish, with Guardiola introducing defensive reinforcements to deal with the pressure, but the visitors held on for their seventh successive league win.\nThe win saw City re-establish their five-point lead at the top of the table, which could be cut to two when Liverpool play Burnley on Wednesday.\n\"We were much the better side - we deserved to win but you have to kill,\" Guardiola said.\n\"It is never over at 2-0, you need the third goal.\n\"In the last few minutes they had chances. For five minutes they were better than us.\n\"You can never relax in the Premier League, that's why it is nice.\"\nFootball Daily podcast: Man City wobble but win, daft red cards and testimonial-intensity Pogba\nSquad depth helps City rumble on\nThe trip to Vicarage Road was City's second of 13 matches in 44 days and Guardiola once again rotated his squad, as he did in the weekend win over Bournemouth.\nSergio Aguero remained sidelined with injury, top scorer Raheem Sterling was rested and an entirely different back four was brought in, including captain Vincent Kompany and England defenders Kyle Walker and John Stones.\nMahrez and David Silva were two of those rested at the weekend and both returned and were influential throughout.\nMahrez's in-swinging cross from the left was bundled in by Sane with his chest in the 40th minute and then the Algerian swept in Gabriel Jesus' cross at the back post six minutes after half-time for City's second.\nThe league leaders would have added more goals but for the excellence of Foster, who denied Mahrez and Sane when one-on-one in the first half.\nHe also produced a fine low save to stop Mahrez's 20-yard shot in the second.\nThe edgy finish to the game was in stark contrast to the rest of the match when City looked in control, with more than 70% of possession.\nThe Watford goal came just two minutes after Kompany left the field holding his hamstring, something which will be of concern with the number of games to come in the coming weeks, and suddenly City's defence looked flustered.\nRegardless City held on for their 13th win from 15 games this season and remain unbeaten.\nWatford show promise\nDefeat for Watford sees them remain in their slump following an impressive start to the season. They have won just two of their last 11 games, after winning their first four this season.\nIt is the first time they have lost three consecutive games under Javi Gracia and they now have their lowest points total after 15 games in their four seasons since returning to the top flight.\nHowever there is no greater challenge currently than facing Guardiola's City and there were positives for Watford.\nThey had few chances but, at 0-0, City goalkeeper Ederson saved well with his legs from Troy Deeney and they did manage to worry their opponents in the closing stages.\nFoster was excellent in goal and while City dominated possession, Watford did not allow themselves to be cut apart and managed to stay in the game.\nGracia told BBC Sport he was \"proud\" of his players: \"You know they always dominate the game and create a lot of chances.\n\"Ben Foster was amazing, we showed very good spirit until the end and in the last few minutes we had the option to get a better result.\n\"I am proud of my players, it is difficult to compete with this very good team. We showed character and desire.\"\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez\nCity's unbeaten run goes on - the best stats\nMan City's goal difference of +38 is the best recorded by an English top-flight team after the first 15 games of a season since Sunderland in 1892-93 (+39).\nCity have scored at least twice in their last nine games against Watford in all competitions, winning all nine by an aggregate score of 29-5.\nWatford have lost three in a row in the Premier League for the first time since December 2017 under Marco Silva (four games).\nCity have now gone unbeaten in each of their last 21 games in the Premier League (W18, D3) since a 3-2 defeat against Manchester United in April.\nRiyad Mahrez has scored more Premier League goals versus Watford than against any other team (six).\nWatford's Abdoulaye Doucoure scored his first Premier League goal in 30 appearances since netting versus Southampton in January.\nWhat's next?\nCity face third-placed Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday (kick-off 17:30 GMT) while Watford travel to Everton on Monday (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-1 Leicester City: James Maddison goal denies Ranieri victory\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri was denied victory over former club Leicester as James Maddison scored for the second successive match to secure a point for the Foxes.\nUntil Maddison swept in the equaliser from Shinji Okazaki's cross from the right, the hosts had looked on course to climb off the bottom of the Premier League and out of the relegation zone thanks to Aboubakar Kamara's goal.\nThe French forward, who had not scored in a league match since 2 January, chased on to Aleksandar Mitrovic's flick, exploiting a mistake from Caglar Soyuncu, to drive a shot through Kasper Schmeichel's legs.\nBut the visitors, who had started brightly and passed up more than enough chances to win, deserved their point.\nIt left the Cottagers to equal an unwanted club record of 19 top-flight matches in a row without a clean sheet, dating back to 1950, and only Barnsley, in 1997-98, have conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League season.\nThe result leaves Fulham bottom of the table, while Leicester remain ninth.\nFollow all the Premier League reaction\nDifferent proposition for Ranieri\nWhen Ranieri masterminded Leicester's stunning Premier League title-winning campaign two years ago, he did so at odds of 5,000-1.\nHis latest job - leading Fulham to safety - is certainly a more modest challenge, but it is an altogether different proposition at the wrong end of the table.\nRanieri arrested a sequence of seven consecutive defeats with victory over Southampton, but he is yet to plug the top-flight's leakiest defence.\nFulham have not won consecutive home matches in the Premier League since April 2013 - and with trips to Manchester United, Newcastle and Arsenal in the next month, they may regard this as an opportunity missed.\nDespite posing an attacking threat with 25 shots on goal, only seven of those were on target, and they looked decidedly shaky at the back.\nGoalkeeper Sergio Rico made several excellent stops, particularly to deny Kelechi Iheanacho in the opening two minutes, while Wes Morgan and Maddison both failed to hit the target from close range when unmarked.\nMaddison strikes new tone\nLeicester's team contained five players involved in Ranieri's last fixture in charge - a 2-1 Champions League defeat in Seville in February 2017 - but there is a different feel to them under Claude Puel.\nWithout the pace of Jamie Vardy, missing with a groin injury, the lightning counter-attacking style employed by Ranieri gave way to a more possession-orientated approach.\nAnd during a first period in which they controlled the flow and tempo of the game, the Foxes could have put the result beyond doubt.\nMaddison was at the heart of their best work - providing tempo to their passing - and it was his threaded pass that set Iheanacho away early on.\nOnce Okazaki and Demarai Gray had been introduced, the 22-year-old had the freedom to press further forward and his surge into the penalty area delivered the reward of an equalising goal, his fifth of an impressive debut season in the Premier League.\nHad he not snatched at a late chance from eight yards - the only one of his three efforts not to hit the target - the Foxes may have won the first of three consecutive matches against London clubs.\nMan of the match - James Maddison (Leicester City)\n'Sooner or later we will win' - what they said\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I think a draw was right. It was just that they had two great chances at the beginning and they had another two after they scored.\n\"In our best moment we conceded a goal and we then had the last chance to win the game. A draw is OK. We have to fight and sooner or later we will win. Everybody is working hard to do their best and in the second half we had the match in our hands. But that's football.\"\nOn Fulham's defensive problems: \"I have to solve it working every day, more and more and more.\"\nOn his reception from fans: \"The experience was fantastic from the beginning when the fans together shouted my name. But after I was so concentrated.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I think it was a normal draw. Any team could have won or lost this game. We had good chances, particularly in the first half.\n\"We played a good team, who did well against Chelsea and Southampton. We were up and down in the game and we needed to manage it more.\n\"I would like to congratulate my players for coming back, which is a good thing for our mentality. We believed in ourselves and that's a good sign for the future.\"\nOn Kelechi Iheanacho: \"After his first chance he lacked a little confidence to move and create other situations. I'm happy about our mentality to fight and try to win but today we had a lot of difficulties.\"\nOn Jamie Vardy being back for the weekend: \"I don't know, we will see. We will adapt in the few days before the game.\"\nFulham's joint worst start - the stats\nFulham's tally of nine points after 15 league games is their joint-worst total at this stage of a season in the Football League (assuming three points for a win), level with the nine they had in the third tier in 1993-94, a season in which they were relegated.\nLeicester have gone six league games without defeat (W2 D4) for the first time since May 2016 (12 games), when they won the Premier League under Ranieri.\nLeicester have not lost any of their past five away Premier League games against newly promoted opponents (W3 D2), their best ever undefeated run away at such opposition in the competition.\nKamara is the first French player to score a Premier League goal for Fulham (excluding own goals) since Philippe Christanval against West Ham in January 2007.\nMitrovic has been directly involved in 60% of Fulham's 15 league goals this season (seven goals, two assists), the highest ratio for any player for a particular club in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nFulham travel to Manchester United in their next Premier League game on Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Leicester host Tottenham on the same day (19:45 GMT)."

In the first half, the organisation and staying in the game was important.\n\"In the second half, we showed desire to go in front. It was fantastic work from the boys. The only way to play these teams is you have to run more than them and when you have your chances take them. We have to maintain these standards.\"\nWolves' win leaves them 12th in the Premier League, only four points behind sixth-placed Everton.\nChelsea had 70% possession and 17 attempts but suffered back-to-back away league defeats despite dominating the first half.\n\"Of course I'm disappointed,\" said Blues boss Maurizio Sarri. \"We played very well in the first half and could have killed the game.\n\"Suddenly we conceded a goal and we were not the same team. It's very difficult for me to understand why - I can't understand the reaction.\n\"We played very well for 55 minutes and then suddenly we were another team.\"\nAfter Chelsea's goal, they had chances to extend their lead but Willian had a free-kick tipped over, Antonio Rudiger shot off target and N'Golo Kante fired just wide.\nThose misses proved costly as Jimenez's low strike, following a fine run from 18-year-old midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, made it level.\nWolves scored what proved to be the winner four minutes later as Matt Doherty's cross was finished at the back post by Jota for his first Premier League goal.\nSarri's side drop down to fourth below Tottenham and remain 10 points behind leaders Manchester City, who they play at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.\nReaction and analysis from Wednesday's Premier League games.\nWolves end 'bad moment' in style\nWolves were promoted to the Premier League after winning the Championship last season and picked up 15 points from their opening eight top-flight matches, but had then gained only one point from their next six.\nThe Portuguese boss admitted his side were \"in a bad moment\" after losing 2-1 at Cardiff on Friday and looked on course for another defeat when the visitors went ahead after only 18 minutes and had opportunities to extend that lead further.\nWolves had been restricted to two headers off target from Jimenez in the first half, but the Mexican scored his fourth league goal of the season in the 59th minute to start the fightback.\nGibbs-White, who was part of the England team that won the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, was making his first Premier League start in place of the suspended Ruben Neves and did superbly to run at the Chelsea defence and release Jimenez.\nThe striker shot low at goal and the ball went under Blues goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga as the hosts scored with their first shot on target.\nThey also found the net with their second attempt on target four minutes later.\nWillian thought he had been fouled by Joao Moutinho but Jonathan Moss waved play on and that enabled Moutinho to set up Doherty who had enough space to cross from the right for Jota's winning goal.\nAnother defeat on the road for Chelsea\nThis was Chelsea's first away match since their 3-1 loss at Tottenham and Sarri will be wondering how they were beaten again.\nThe Italian handed first league starts of the season to defender Andreas Christensen and midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Loftus-Cheek, who had scored when he came off the bench in the 2-0 win over Fulham on Sunday.\nThe England midfielder will try to claim the 18th-minute goal when he shot from 25 yards out, although it could go down as an own goal as Coady, trying to block the effort, stooped low to head it, but could only steer it past Rui Patricio.\nChelsea's lead looked a comfortable one as Willian's 22-yard free-kick was excellently tipped over by Patricio and Rudiger wastefully shot over.\nAnd the Blues may feel they should have had a penalty early in the second half when Loftus-Cheek's low cross was destined to present Alvaro Morata with a simple tap in, only for the Spaniard to fall under Willy Boly's challenge.\nReferee Moss, however, waved away Chelsea's penalty appeal.\nWolves' Moutinho was also fortunate to not see a second yellow card for a foul on Loftus-Cheek, which came only two minutes after he had been cautioned for fouling Hazard.\nBut still Chelsea created chances as Willian shot over and Kante fired inches wide in the 57th minute before two goals in four minutes turned the match around.\nFor Morata, preferred up front ahead of Olivier Giroud, it was another unconvincing performance with him wasting his only chance - shooting over from 25 yards after only 11 minutes.\nGiroud replaced Morata in the second half but he too headed over from a corner, Hazard shot just off target and Fabregas missed with a curling effort as Wolves held on.\nRare Wolves win on a Wednesday - the stats\nWolves have won a top-flight game played on a Wednesday for the first time since beating Chelsea 1-0 at Molineux in January 2011.\nWolves have defeated 'Big Six' opposition in the Premier League for the first time since February 2011 against Manchester United (2-1) - they were winless in their previous 18 such games.\nChelsea have lost consecutive away games against newly-promoted sides for the first time since December 1999 (versus Watford and Sunderland).\nEach of Wolves' last nine league goals at Molineux have been scored in the second half.\nWolves' Morgan Gibbs-White (18 years and 312 days) became the youngest player to assist a Premier League goal against Chelsea since Francis Jeffers for Everton in November 1999 (18 years and 298 days).\nChelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek has scored three goals in his last three Premier League games, as many as in his previous 48 combined in the competition.\nRaul Jimenez has been directly involved in 53% of Wolves' goals in the Premier League this season (eight of 15).\nDiogo Jota ended a run of 15 league games without a goal for Wolves, last netting against Bolton in the Championship in April.\nMan of the match - Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea)\n'What I've dreamed of' - what they said\nWolves teenager Morgan Gibbs-White, who assisted a goal on his first Premier League start: \"It's what I've dreamed of as a kid, growing up wanting to play in the Premier League. To get three points is a massive boost.\n\"We had to [defend well] with the quality they have. We have a determination and want to win. But we need to show that in all our games, not just against the big teams.\"\nChelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek: \"We felt in control in the first half. We felt comfortable and were playing good football. They came out fast in the second half and we were sloppy as a team. If you're sloppy you pay for it in the Premier League.\n\"We should expect to play well whoever plays. We need to turn this around quickly because we have a tough game at the weekend [Manchester City]. We're very disappointed. We pick our heads up and go again.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea entertain Premier League leaders Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday (17:30 GMT), before Wolves play at Newcastle on Sunday (16:00 GMT)."

We reacted well and had clear chances which could have changed the match.\n\"We knew what they came here to do which was to wait for our mistake. I think the stats suggest we controlled the match. To break their organisation you have to play faster and we didn't do that in the second half. We take it game by game and our mentality is to win and do what we can.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez said: \"I think the work we produced against a very good team was fantastic.\n\"We suffered after taking the lead but we were better in the second half and both teams had chances to score. The main thing was to defend well and create chances, but we would like to be more accurate in our counter-attacks.\n\"We have to be realistic, they are a good team and they had chances in the first half, and they have four games unbeaten at home, so we have to credit our players.\"\nEverton see the most possession in a top-flight game since 2003-04 - the stats\nEverton are unbeaten in their last eight midweek matches in the Premier League (W4 D4), since losing 0-3 at Sunderland in May 2016.\nNewcastle haven't won a midweek Premier League match since December 2013 (5-1 v Stoke), drawing nine and losing nine played on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday since.\nEverton posted a 76.3% possession rate, their highest in a Premier League game since 2003-04.\nNewcastle's Salomon Rondon has netted three goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 18 in the competition.\nEverton forward Richarlison has netted three goals in his last three home Premier League appearances, one more than he scored in his previous 22.\nRicharlison has scored seven goals in 13 appearances in the Premier League this season, two more than he managed in 38 games for Watford (5) last season.\nWhat's next?\nEverton return to action on Monday, 10 December when they host Watford at Goodison Park (20:00 GMT), while Newcastle return to St James' Park to face Wolves on Sunday, 9 December (16:00 GMT)."

It was a credit to the team.\"\nAnalysis: Have Man Utd fans accepted B-List status?\nRelive Wednesday's Premier League action\nMourinho's men show grit, but little quality\nMourinho demonstrated he would not shy away from taking the big decisions as Pogba and Lukaku were consigned to the bench - he will have known the spotlight would have shone on him in unforgiving fashion had United lost.\nIn the end, it was a performance that was satisfying in parts but merely emphasised just how far United are behind the pacesetters.\nUnited may not, as Mourinho complained, have any \"mad dogs\" in their side, but there was at least some bite about this display after recent tame efforts against Crystal Palace here, and at Southampton.\nThat was appreciated by United's fans as a starting base, but there was little to suggest this was a team whose season was about to burst belatedly into life.\nUnited's attack was more fluid and mobile with Martial and Marcus Rashford selected ahead of Lukaku but there was still a lack of creativity, and while the effort was there, the real spark was missing.\nMourinho will be pleased at the manner in which United responded to Arsenal's goals, helped by the Gunners' sloppiness, and these were players who were undoubtedly putting in the work for their manager.\nThis is, however, a pale shadow of a side that will chase the big prizes.\nMixed feelings for Arsenal boss Emery\nArsenal will, ultimately, probably be happy with a point at a ground where their recent record is miserable, and against opponents who were attempting to put down a marker after recent criticism.\nGunners boss Unai Emery, however, will feel disappointment that they did not leave with all three points after twice holding the advantage only to concede it quickly.\nEmery's frustration was obvious when Lingard scored United's second equaliser moments after Lacazette had restored their lead, as he knew had they held their advantage a little longer there is every chance United could have become frustrated.\nThe manner in which it was conceded will have also infuriated the animated Emery, United striking back right from the kick-off with the aid of Kolasinac's error.\nOn the plus side, Arsenal coped well with United's predictable late aerial siege and this is a point that consolidated their good start to the season and extends that fine unbeaten sequence.\nEmery may have wanted the win as Arsenal failed to reproduce the electrifying form that beat Spurs in the north London derby but there was still plenty to satisfy him.\nArsenal defender Holding might have a 'big injury'\nMan of the match - Eric Bailly (Manchester United)\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"We scored four goals and drew 2-2! As always we made mistakes and we paid for the mistakes.\n\"Today was more the same, but with great spirit and people ready to have a go and fight hard, it was a credit to the team.\n\"They went to the limit and were really tired. Some of them had not played all season, Chris Smalling playing in very difficult condition, but Arsenal were only dangerous when we lost the ball in bad areas.\n\"Even from our bench you could feel the little panic when the ball comes to our defensive third.\n\"The spirit was Manchester United level but we miss certain qualities.\n\"I have to disagree with people who try to compare this to teams of Roy Keane, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Nemanja Vidic. Give us a break and time. I am happy with the soul and heart, but we are not consistent and uniform.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"I think we controlled the game, the second half better than the first. We could have won this match in certain moments, but they equalised very quickly after both our goals.\n\"We need to improve defensively, but we need to have balance and not lose our attacking chances.\n\"We perhaps lost a bit of control there but we created lots of chances after 2-2 and I am very proud of our performance. We wanted to win but we can feel this point is good.\"\nUnited continue leaking goals - the stats\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho has only lost one of his 16 games against Arsenal in the Premier League (winning seven and drawing eight) and remains unbeaten in home games in the competition against them.\nArsenal are now unbeaten in their last 20 games in all competitions, their longest such run since November 2007 (28 games).\nManchester United have conceded more goals at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season (10 goals in seven games) than they did in the whole of 2017-18 (nine in 18 games).\nArsenal are still yet to lead a Premier League game at half time this season, although they haven't gone on to suffer a defeat in the competition since August (2-3 v Chelsea).\nManchester United winger Anthony Martial has scored seven goals in his last seven starts in the Premier League, with three of those coming at Old Trafford.\nJesse Lingard's second half equaliser for Manchester United came 74 seconds after Arsenal had retaken a 2-1 lead, and just 13 seconds after restarting the game from kick-off.\nManchester United made a total of seven changes to their starting XI against Arsenal - indeed, they have made more than any other team in the Premier League this season (46).\nWhat's next\nManchester United play Fulham at home on Saturday at 15:00 GMT with Arsenal entertaining Huddersfield at the same time."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Southampton: Kane, Moura & Son scores in hosts' win\nRalph Hasenhuttl was reminded of the task facing him at his new club Southampton as Tottenham took advantage of defensive frailties to win and move into third spot in the Premier League.\nThe 51-year-old Austrian, who takes charge on Thursday, watched from the Wembley Stadium stands as his side crumbled in four second-half minutes after Harry Kane had tapped in the opener in the ninth minute.\nBrazilian Lucas Moura made it 2-0 in the 51st minute when he fired home from eight yards, before Son Heung-min notched his fourth goal of the season with a close-range finish from Kane's ball.\nSouthampton created several chances but were twice thwarted by the woodwork and by goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. They finally found a way past the France keeper in stoppage time when Charlie Austin fired home.\nThe victory sees Spurs leapfrog Chelsea and Arsenal into third, with 33 points, while Southampton remain in the relegation zone with nine points.\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League matches\nHasenhuttl appointed Southampton manager\nSpurs take advantage of rivals' slip-ups\nA home fixture against struggling Southampton, coming off the back of the derby defeat at Arsenal, was the ideal tonic for manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nHowever, with eight fixtures in 28 days in December, the Argentine still felt the need to rotate his personnel. One of the five brought into the starting XI was right-back Kieran Trippier, who had been out with a groin strain since early November.\nIt was the England full-back's flick-on to Son that almost resulted in the opening goal as the South Korean's low volley rebounded off the base of the post.\nSpurs did take the lead soon after when Kane got in front of his marker to sidefoot home Christian Eriksen's cross.\nMoura and Son made it 3-0 shortly after the break, although the hosts needed two good saves from Lloris to ensure a comfortable finish to the game, despite Austin's late effort.\nWith rivals Arsenal and Chelsea slipping up, the evening could not have gone better for Spurs who will hope for another win at Leicester on Saturday before their decisive Champions League tie against Barcelona in the Nou Camp.\nPochettino said it was \"job done\" but was unhappy the Saints were allowed several opportunities to score.\n\"We started the second half really well,\" said the Argentine. \"It's true that Southampton created more - it's unlucky for them because they had good chances.\n\"Lloris was man of the match and that's something I'm disappointed about. We conceded more chances than against Arsenal. However, I feel it was job done and I'm happy with the three points.\"\nSaints' attacking play gives Hasenhuttl hope\nHasenhuttl might decide to focus on the backline in his first training session following this dismal defensive display at Wembley.\nThe usually reliable Maya Yoshida was caught ball-watching for the opening goal, while the defence failed to close both Moura and Son down for their goals.\nThe Saints have now conceded 29 goals in the league this season and have the fourth worst defensive record.\nBut at least he has something to build upon thanks to a superb display by his attack. Danish midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg saw one stunning effort pushed on to the post by Lloris before Nathan Redmond saw his deflected shot come off the bar.\nThe Spurs keeper then made a great stop from point-blank range to deny James Ward-Prowse before he dived to his left to push away Austin's shot.\nThe former QPR striker did eventually beat Lloris when he fired home from inside the area with seconds of the match remaining.\nAfterwards, interim manager Kelvin Davis said: \"We conceded three goals and our standards are better than that. We lost a bit of focus on the set-plays and people ghosted in.\n\"On reflection from the whole game, I don't think anyone would say we didn't deserve at least one goal. I really believe that if we produce those opportunities again in three or four games' time then we'll get our rewards.\"\nSouthampton's next fixture is at relegation rivals Cardiff.\nMan of the match - Hugo Lloris (Tottenham)\nTeen Skipp youngest debutant since Bale - the stats\nTottenham have now won each of their last 10 home Premier League games against sides starting the day in the relegation zone, scoring 23 goals while conceding just three.\nSouthampton (P13, W0, D7, L6) are currently on their longest winless run in all competitions since October 1998 (also 13 matches).\nTottenham have now won 11 and lost four of their 15 league games this season, meaning only Manchester United (17 in 2012-13) and Bolton Wanderers (18 in 2011-12) have opened a Premier League season playing more matches before their first draw of the campaign.\nSouthampton have won just nine points from their opening 15 games this season. Only three of the previous 18 teams to have won nine points or fewer from their first 15 games of a Premier League season have avoided relegation: Sunderland in 2013-14, Wigan in 2007-08 and Coventry in 1995-96.\nKane has been directly involved in nine goals in his last seven Premier League games against Southampton, scoring seven times and laying on a further two assists.\nTottenham playmaker Christian Eriksen has provided at least one assist in each of his last three Premier League games (four total), the first time he has done so within a single campaign since April 2016.\nTottenham's Oliver Skipp (18 years and 79 days) is the youngest player to debut for the club since Gareth Bale against Manchester United in August 2007 (18 years and 40 days).\nWhat's next?\nThe Saints are at fellow strugglers Cardiff on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and Tottenham are at Leicester on the same day (19:45 GMT)."

He deserved it today. I hope we'll win something together.\"\nSalah scored his second hat-trick for the club since arriving from Roma 18 months ago as Jurgen Klopp's side went one point clear of Manchester City, who later suffered their first top-flight defeat of the season as they lost 2-0 at Chelsea.\nSalah was in an offside position when Roberto Firmino hit a 30-yard shot that home keeper Asmir Begovic carelessly pushed out in the direction of the Egypt forward. He finished clinically and his eighth top-flight goal of the season was allowed to stand to break the deadlock in a game the visitors dominated from the start.\nThere was nothing fortuitous about the Liverpool forward's second though, a composed finish after driving at the Bournemouth defence, before Steve Cook backheeled the ball into his own net while attempting a clearance to make it 3-0.\nSalah then completed his hat-trick after rounding Begovic, cutting back to beat the Bournemouth keeper for a second time and poking the ball past Nathan Ake on the line.\n\"Whatever you do in a football game, you need somebody to finish it off and what Mo did with his two goals in the second half was exceptional,\" said Klopp after his side's fifth straight league win.\nLiverpool have taken 45 points from the past 51 on offer and are unbeaten in 17 league games in a run that stretches back to last season.\nQuiz: Can you name the players who have made 500 Premier League appearances?\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nReaction from the Vitality Stadium\nSalah back to best at start of huge week\nThe wins keep coming for Liverpool - and the goals are flowing once again for Salah.\nHaving successfully negotiated a bruising night at Burnley on Wednesday, Klopp's side started a huge week by ruthlessly dismantling Bournemouth.\nSalah goes into Tuesday's Champions League must-win group game with Napoli having marked his return to the starting line-up by emphatically ending a three-match run without a goal.\nBournemouth have every right to feel disgruntled about the former Chelsea player's first, with television replays clearly showing Salah was offside when Firmino struck the shot that Begovic spilled into his path.\nYet the hosts can have few complaints about his second or third.\nDespite Cook's attempt to bring him down, Salah stayed on his feet to drive at Bournemouth's defence before producing a neat finish into the corner via a slight deflection off Ake.\nCook's troubled game continued when the Bournemouth defender inadvertently diverted the ball into his own net following a cross by Andy Robertson, before Salah completed the rout.\nAfter shrugging Cook off the ball following substitute Adam Lallana's long punt forward, Salah dribbled into the box before tormenting Begovic and slotting home.\nAfter the game, Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe described Salah as \"one of the best in the world\".\n\"Salah looked very good, razor sharp and we struggled to handle him. He played more centrally and did well from that position,\" he said.\nWhile the headlines belong to Salah, Liverpool overcame the absences of injured defensive trio Joe Gomez, Dejan Lovren and Nathaniel Clyne to record a 10th Premier League clean sheet of the season before next Sunday's visit of Manchester United to Anfield.\nBournemouth come unstuck against top six - again\nBournemouth started the weekend seventh in the table - level on points with sixth-placed Everton - and with plaudits ringing in Howe's ears.\nTheir climb from League Two to the fringes of European qualification in 10 seasons is nothing short of phenomenal, but the Cherries were second best all over the pitch against Liverpool.\nThis scenario is becoming a familiar story for the Dorset club against the league's leading sides.\nHowe's team are regularly praised for producing attractive, progressive football - but their record against the top-six teams is extremely poor.\nSince the start of 2017-18, Bournemouth have lost 15 times in 17 games against Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United.\nThe bad news is they still have to face Tottenham and United - both away - in the league this month.\nThey were not helped by the absence of leading scorer Callum Wilson because of a hamstring injury, but the England striker would not have helped their defence - now without a clean sheet in seven league and cup games - contain Liverpool.\n500 not out for Milner\nThis was a momentous day for Milner.\nWith Jordan Henderson on the bench, Milner captained Liverpool to victory in a game in which his statistics were again impressive.\nHaving covered 12.57 kilometres at Burnley in midweek - more than any other player on the pitch - the 32-year-old clocked up another 11.73 filling in at right-back against Bournemouth.\nThere was one nervous moment when his misplaced first-half pass required Alisson to dash out of his goal to head clear - and in doing so, taking out Joshua King.\nBut Milner was otherwise a reassuring presence in the back four, demonstrating his value to Klopp with his ability to move from midfield to full-back and give youngster Trent Alexander-Arnold a rest with Gomez injured.\nIn fact the Yorkshireman found himself in the Bournemouth half as often as he was his own as he played a significant part in the 238th top-flight win of his career.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\n'Another game that has gone away from us' - the managers\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"I have many complaints. He [Salah] was offside [for the first goal]. It has a huge bearing on the match. We were fine until that moment. It changes the game.\n\"It was difficult for us losing Callum Wilson. We have to deal with players who aren't here and can't use that as an excuse. We still had a competitive team on the pitch.\n\"The first goal is key and then we made some mistakes at bad times.\n\"At half-time I thought we were well in this match. I expected a very different second half. We just had to manage the scoreline. It is a tough league. We are disappointed as it's another game that has gone away from us.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It is clear that everyone knows about the quality of Bournemouth.\n\"We had to keep the ball and win the ball back as quickly as possible. We did both very often but not always as they had their moments too, of course.\n\"I don't know if it was offside. I've not watched it back but we improved in the second half and controlled the game. It was really nice. Mo Salah scores that goal [the second one] and I don't think many do in that situation.\n\"The third goal was again brilliant. It is really cool and it helps of course! We played nice football and the players we brought on did really well.\"\nOwn goal misery for Cherries - the stats\nSince the start of 2015-16, Bournemouth have scored more own goals in the Premier League (eight) than any other side currently in the top flight.\nLiverpool have accrued 42 points from their opening 16 league games of the season, their best tally at this stage of a top-flight campaign.\nHowe has lost more games in all competitions against Liverpool than against any other side (eight).\nBegovic has made eight errors leading directly to a goal in the Premier League since the start of 2017-18, more than any other player.\nBournemouth's Jefferson Lerma has been shown 22 yellow cards in the Premier League since the start of last season, more than any other player in Europe's big five leagues (38 apps).\nSalah's opener was his 40th goal in his 52nd Premier League appearance for Liverpool, the fastest a player has reached that milestone in the competition for the Reds (Fernando Torres 60, Daniel Sturridge 64).\nSince the start of last season, only Lionel Messi (43) has scored more league goals in the big five European leagues than Salah (42).\nSalah is only the second Liverpool player to score a competitive hat-trick against Bournemouth after Harry Chambers in the FA Cup in January 1927.\nAlisson has remained unbeaten in his opening 16 league matches as a Liverpool player, which is a club record as it moves him ahead of Javier Mascherano (15, set in November 2007).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth take on Wolverhampton Wanderers (15:00 GMT) next Saturday while Liverpool have back-to-back home games against Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00) and Manchester United in the Premier League next Sunday (16:00)."

Why were we waiting? The first half was a warm-up.\n\"I want my team to play and fight for every single ball. We have to be stronger, more confident in our qualities.\n\"In the first half it was 11 lambs against 11 wolves. The wolves ate the lambs.\"\nThe hosts took the lead after 13 minutes when Ashley Young bustled his way into the penalty area and curled the ball into the far corner.\nMarcus Rashford set up Juan Mata for United's second, before Romelu Lukaku finished from close range from Mata's low cross.\nSubstitute Aboubakar Kamara pulled one back with a penalty after he had been fouled by Ander Herrera, but Ranieri's side were soon reduced to 10 men, when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa was dismissed for two bookable offences.\nEngland striker Rashford sealed United's victory with a powerful strike from a tight angle to beat Sergio Rico at his near post.\nThis was the first time this season the Red Devils had won by a three-goal margin in the league, although they did beat Young Boys 3-0 in the Champions League in September.\nThe last time they won by three goals in the league was on 15 January, with a 3-0 home defeat of Stoke.\nPogba will show everyone how good he is - Mourinho\nRelive Manchester United's win over Fulham as it happened\nAnalysis and reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nMan Utd impress without Pogba\nThis was a welcome win for United after a derby defeat by Manchester City on 11 November that preceded three successive draws in the league - against Crystal Palace, Southampton and Arsenal.\nThat had increased the external pressure on Mourinho, though his agent said on Friday the Portuguese was \"very happy at the club and the club is very happy with him\".\nMourinho named World Cup winner Paul Pogba on the bench, as he was against the Gunners, while forward Anthony Martial was missing because of a hamstring injury.\nThe United boss kept faith with 19-year-old right-back Diogo Dalot, starting a Premier League match for only the second time after his \u00a319m summer move from Porto, and was rewarded with a fine performance.\nBut United's first goal came from the other full-back - Young, who picked up the ball on the side of the penalty area, forced his way past Denis Odoi and curled home.\nMata, who came in for Martial, was also excellent, scoring the second, then setting up Lukaku - scoring his second goal in 15 United games - for the third.\nKamara lifted Fulham's hopes of a recovery with a controversial penalty after he was tackled by Herrera, who looked to have won the ball.\nBut the London side were reduced to 10 men within two minutes of that goal, and from then on United dominated again and Rashford got the goal he deserved in the 82nd minute to complete a fine evening for United and Mourinho.\nA lot of work for Ranieri to do\nFor Fulham, the opening half highlighted their defensive frailties. They are the only team not to have kept a clean sheet in the top flight this season, and have now conceded at least three goals in a match in seven of 16 games.\nRanieri will be worried by the ease with which his side were carved open for United's first three goals.\nThe Italian, a Premier League winner with Leicester, made two big decisions at half-time - replacing top goalscorer Aleksandar Mitrovic and captain Tom Cairney with Luciano Vietto and Kamara - and was rewarded with a much better second-half performance.\nKamara won a penalty and converted it himself, but any hope of an incredible fightback ended within two minutes when Anguissa was sent off. The Cameroon international seemed to be penalised harshly by referee Lee Probert when he was adjudged to have fouled Rashford, after being cautioned for an earlier foul on Lingard.\nWith only 10 men, it was no surprise Fulham conceded again and Ranieri will face a very difficult task to tighten his side up in defence as they look to avoid an instant return to the Championship.\nMourinho reaches his half-century of United league wins - the stats\nMourinho recorded his 50th Premier League victory as United manager in his 92nd game.\nFulham have conceded in 20 consecutive top-flight games - their longest run without a clean sheet in the top tier.\nFulham have conceded 40 goals in their opening 16 Premier League games this season; only Barnsley in 1997-98 (43) have conceded more at this stage of a top-flight campaign since the start of the 1965-66 season.\nFulham have lost 22 of their past 24 away matches against United in all competitions (won one, drew one) - their only win in this sequence was a 3-1 victory in the Premier League in October 2003.\nRashford (one goal, two assists) has been directly involved in three goals in a single Premier League game for only the second time in his career and the first since his debut in the competition versus Arsenal in February 2016.\nMata is only the third Spanish player to both score 50+ goals and register 50+ assists in Premier League history, after Cesc Fabregas and David Silva.\nYoung ended a run of 39 games in all competitions without a goal for United, since netting twice versus Watford in November 2017 - 375 days ago.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\n'Beautiful football' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho told Sky Sports: \"The first half was really good. We gave no chances to Fulham. We were strong, aggressive and intense. At times it was beautiful football. The first half was perfect.\n\"The second half was Ranieri's fault. He made two changes that improved his team and gave us problems that we didn't have in the first half. I also think there was some fatigue in some of my players. A few factors made the second half not as good as the first.\n\"We were intense without the ball and with the ball. Without the ball we pressed, we kept Mitrovic away from goal. With the ball it was simple, one or two touches. We were really good.\n\"We needed it. The last three matches we didn't lose, but didn't win. Now we have two away matches, then two at home. Let's see if we can get more points from those matches.\n\"The players have shown they can be a better team than they are. When there is solidarity in the team, everyone giving their maximum, you attract more positive things.\"\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri told BBC Sport: \"The second half was much better but I have to consider if that was a down from Manchester United because they were winning 3-0 or we made a good performance.\n\"Go, play football. Then, if they score, it is normal. In the second half, we did. Why we didn't in the first half, I need to speak with my players.\n\"The response in the second half was positive. We played with more intensity, we were hungry, everything better than the first half.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to Valencia in their final Champions League Group H game on Wednesday, 12 December (20:00 GMT). United have already qualified for the last 16 but can still win the group, although they need to beat the Spanish side and hope Juventus drop points at Swiss side Young Boys.\nUnited are next in Premier League action when they play at Liverpool on Sunday, 16 December (16:00 GMT). That game comes a day after Fulham's next match - against West Ham at Craven Cottage (Saturday, 17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-0 Huddersfield Town: Lucas Torreira's late stunner sees hosts overcome Terriers\nLucas Torreira scored a sublime bicycle kick late on to break Huddersfield's resistance and secure victory for Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.\nThe visitors, who have slipped into the bottom three, had looked on course for a valuable point with a resolute defensive display.\nBut on 83 minutes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang found room at the back post and deftly chipped across the six-yard box for Torreira to acrobatically volley in.\nIt was a rare moment of quality from the hosts, who failed to create regular chances, despite Alexandre Lacazette having a goal disallowed for offside shortly before the interval.\nThe France striker was replaced at half-time, with a slightly improved Arsenal scoring their 26th second-half goal of the season to extend their unbeaten run to 21 games in all competitions.\nThe Gunners briefly moved into the top four but slipped back to fifth after Chelsea and Tottenham won later on Saturday.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action from the Emirates\nSecond-half surges and sublime skill\nArsenal manager Unai Emery has now made 14 substitutions at the break in 16 league games this season, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alex Iwobi replacing Lacazette and Stephan Lichtsteiner here.\nOnce again the Spaniard's willingness to overhaul his side's approach paid off, with both substitutes stretching Huddersfield's backline and ensuring Aubameyang was less reliant on dropping deep to receive the ball.\nThe Gabon striker was frustrated in the first half - his only telling contribution narrowly diverting Granit Xhaka's cross wide on 28 minutes - as he failed to link up effectively with Lacazette, who slipped when unmarked in the area and shot over the bar moments after Aubameyang's miss.\nLacazette then rounded Jonas Lossl to slot in after running onto Mathias Jorgensen's poor backpass but he was judged offside from Aubameyang's initial header on.\nThat was one of few flurries of promising play from Arsenal, the other coming just before the goal as Sead Kolasinac started to get in behind down the left.\nEven then it took a sequence of sublime skill for Arsenal to find a way through - Matteo Guendouzi finding Aubameyang with a well-judged cross-field pass, the striker touching it away from his man and turning to cross and Torreira applying a sumptuous finish.\nIt was indicative of Arsenal this season - flawed but fun. They may not be able to rely on these second-half surges and impact substitutions for the whole season but there is plenty of grit and skill in this team.\nArsenal's defensive concerns deepen\nIn spite of victory, Arsenal will be concerned by yet another injury to a key defender as Shkodran Mustafi was forced off in the second half after appearing to pull his hamstring.\nFellow centre-back Rob Holding was ruled out for the season this week after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee against Manchester United.\nAdding to that dearth of options, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Lichsteiner picked up their fifth yellow cards of the season and will miss the Premier League match at Southampton next Sunday.\nIt is also understood Arsenal do not have a recall clause in Callum Chambers' loan deal at Fulham, and the Gunners may have to field some makeshift defences over a busy festive period.\nHowever, Laurent Koscielny was on the bench for the first time since rupturing his Achilles tendon in May and fellow defender Nacho Monreal returned from a hamstring injury to replace Mustafi. Arsenal will hope both can regain match fitness quickly.\nTerriers battle in vain\nHuddersfield were content to let Arsenal dominate possession but constantly hassled the man on the ball, leaving the hosts visibly frustrated.\nA sedate start turned scrappy with a sequence of hard tackles by both sides, resulting in seven yellow cards before half-time.\nXhaka, Mustafi and Guendouzi were booked for simulation, perhaps suggesting Arsenal's mounting desperation, from which the Terriers prospered.\nThe visitors created some openings, if not many clear chances, with an unmarked Alex Pritchard clipping over from the edge of the area in the first half and Laurent Depoitre having a late penalty appeal turned down after what looked to be a fair challenge by Sokratis.\nLossl had a fine match, making a superb diving stop with his left to deny a curling effort from Torreira.\nBut ultimately a limited Terriers team could not cause Arsenal's defence many problems, with Huddersfield having scored just 10 goals in 16 games now - the fewest by any Premier League side.\nMan of the match - Lucas Torreira (Arsenal)\n'I wanted us to win quicker' - reaction\nArsenal manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a tough match, like many matches, and today it is important because we didn't have rhythm but still won. I'm very happy with the result. It was hard for us to control the match today.\n\"Patience is the key word. I wanted us to win more quickly but we needed to be patient.\n\"We can improve more and today we spoke that we want to win matches with more control. But we are very competitive and showed character.\"\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Obviously it is hard to take but I can see the positives. This was a proper fight which the players gave Arsenal. We did so many things right and limited their qualities. Unfortunately the result is what it is.\n\"We frustrated Arsenal, how the players did it tactically, and the shift they put in, was brilliant. Our tactics worked but unfortunately this goal was an unlucky one because the rebound and second rebound went to Arsenal.\"\nArsenal shine in the second half - stats\nArsenal have not led at half-time in any of their 16 Premier League games this season, drawing 12 and losing four.\nEmery's Arsenal have made 14 substitutions before the start of the second half in their 16 Premier League matches this season, more than any other side and five more than Arsene Wenger made with the Gunners in the whole of 2017-18 (nine).\nArsenal are now 21 games unbeaten in all competitions (W16 D5 L0); their longest run without a defeat since November 2007 (28 unbeaten).\nThere were just two shots on target in this game, the fewest in a Premier League match since Watford v Stoke on 28 October 2017 (also two).\nThere were seven cards shown in the first half of this match (seven yellows), the most in a Premier League first 45 since Chelsea v Aston Villa in January 2011 (also seven yellows).\nAubameyang has been directly involved in 27 goals in his 29 Premier League appearances with Arsenal, scoring 20 and assisting seven.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host Qarabag in the Europa League on Thursday (kick-off 20:00 GMT) before travelling to Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday, 16 December (13:30).\nHuddersfield are at home to Newcastle on Saturday, 15 December (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 1-0 Southampton: Ralph Hasenhuttl 'not disappointed' after defeat in first game\nNew Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl took the positives from his first game in charge, despite Callum Paterson's goal giving Cardiff City a precious victory in the battle against Premier League relegation.\n\"I was not disappointed with what my team showed me, but that's the basics,\" said the Austrian, who has replaced the sacked Mark Hughes. \"The rest will come in the next weeks.\n\"It will be perfect if we get some results for the self-confidence. We didn't here, but we have to keep working and they will come.\"\nCardiff squandered several chances during a frenetic first half in which a vulnerable visiting defence looked there for the taking.\nSouthampton appeared to have weathered that storm after the break but, as the rain came down at a raucous Cardiff City Stadium, they fell behind in shambolic fashion.\nA pass from Victor Camarasa ran harmlessly to Jannik Vestergaard, but the Saints centre-back inexplicably dithered on the ball and was dispossessed by Paterson, whose low finish dribbled slowly into the corner.\nFollow Saturday afternoon's Premier League action here\nRelive Cardiff 1-0 Southampton here\n\"It is very hard to accept that we didn't get a point, but with these mistakes we don't deserve it,\" Hasenhuttl said.\n\"We had a lot of pressure and we were good with the ball, but we played too much from deep and inside instead of penetrating them.\n\"We need more forward runs in the coming months and less mistakes in the defence.\"\nCardiff's fourth win in five home matches lifted them to 14th place in the table, four points clear of the bottom three.\nFor Southampton, meanwhile, a 12th league game without victory leaves them second from bottom, three points adrift of safety.\nA losing start for Hasenhuttl\nThe size of the task facing new Southampton manager Hasenhuttl was underlined on Wednesday, when the Austrian watched from the Wembley Stadium stands as his side were soundly beaten by Tottenham.\nDubbed the \"Klopp of the Alps\" because of his charismatic personality and emphasis on high-pressing, energetic football, the 51-year-old made his mark immediately with a first-team selection which showed six changes from that midweek loss.\nOne of the players recalled, striker Charlie Austin, had three early chances but failed to make the most of those openings - putting one wide, one over and the other straight at goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.\nThose opportunities, however, were something of a false dawn.\nHasenhuttl will have been concerned by his side's defensive frailties, particularly their vulnerability against Cardiff's counter-attacks.\nEven with three changes to their back four, the Saints defenders were often out of position and exposed by the pace of their opponents' wingers, Josh Murphy and Nathaniel Mendez-Laing.\nIt proved the undoing of young right-back Yan Valery, taken off at the break after a chastening 45 minutes in which he was run ragged by Murphy and booked for a foul on the Cardiff player.\nAs fragile as Southampton were, the hosts' inability to convert their chances appeared to lift the Saints' confidence in the second half.\nThey started to hold the ball for longer periods and, after an hour, they had an appeal for a penalty turned down by referee Jonathan Moss as Stuart Armstrong fell rather theatrically following a challenge from Camarasa, with replays suggesting there was only minimal - if any - contact.\nSouthampton offered little else as an attacking threat, and their defensive weaknesses eventually led to their downfall as Vestergaard - unconvincing throughout the game - crumbled under pressure from Paterson to hand Cardiff the winning goal.\nCardiff's home comforts\nCardiff may still be regarded by many as prime relegation candidates but they had given their survival prospects a real shot in the arm with three wins from their previous four home matches.\nWhat was particularly impressive about those victories was that they had all been achieved from losing positions, a combination of their tenacious team spirit and the rousing atmosphere inside Cardiff City Stadium.\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock had joked in the build-up to this match that, while impressive, those comebacks were not good for his stress levels and general wellbeing.\nFor once, however, this was not a match that Cardiff needed to pull from the fire.\nThey had a host of chances to take the lead, with Harry Arter volleying tamely at Alex McCarthy before Murphy ran clear of the Southampton defence, only to be foiled by their goalkeeper as well.\nCardiff looked most dangerous on the break, countering at speed with Murphy and Mendez-Laing - but their finishing was amiss.\nWarnock's men were also threatening from set-pieces, although their wastefulness looked like undermining their hopes of winning.\nBut with a helping hand from Vestergaard, makeshift striker Paterson - signed as a right-back at the start of last season - provided the crucial finishing touch to score his fourth goal of the season.\nMan of the match - Harry Arter (Cardiff)\nSaints' longest winless run since 1989 - the stats\nCardiff have won four of their last five Premier League home games (L1), as many as they had won in their previous 22 in the competition (W4 D6 L12).\nSouthampton's current 14-game winless run (W0 D7 L7) is their longest such run in all competitions since March 1989 (20 games).\nCardiff ended a run of 12 Premier League games without a clean sheet, since a 0-0 draw with Huddersfield in August.\nSouthampton are winless in their last nine Premier League games against newly promoted teams (D5 L4).\nSouthampton have lost eight of their last nine away league games against Cardiff (W1).\nNine of Callum Paterson's 14 league goals for Cardiff City have been on home soil (64%).\n'We've already surprised a lot of people' - what the managers said\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock: \"We made it hard work. I felt we should have made it more comfortable with the chances that we had.\n\"I criticise referees a lot, but Jonathan Moss is the only referee who would have played advantage like he did for the goal.\n\"We know that we're going to get most of the points here - we've already surprised a lot of people - but we just need to keep our feet on the ground.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"For a long time it looked like a 0-0. It was a very tough game for both teams.\n\"In the second period our performance was better and better. We had a few chances but in this best period we nearly made an own goal. It was a terrible mistake.\n\"The mentality was OK. We never gave up today. I have seen some good things from my team but we made too many mistakes today. We know that we have a hard and long way ahead of us.\"\nWhat's next?\nCardiff travel to Watford in the Premier League on Saturday, 15 December (kick-off 15:00 GMT) while Southampton host Arsenal on Sunday, 16 December (kick-off 13:30 GMT) in Hasenhuttl's first home match in charge."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-0 Brighton: James Tarkowksi goal earns Clarets hard-fought win\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said he was \"relieved\" after his team climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone with victory over Brighton.\nThe Clarets were 19th before Saturday's game, and without a win in their past eight league matches, but James Tarkowski's fortuitous first-half goal was enough to win a tight game at Turf Moor.\n\"It was a hard-earned and hard-fought win,\" Dyche told Match of the Day. \"We thought we would have to dig in and we have done that.\n\"Performances have suggested we were getting back to that hardy edge that we know we have. We created chances but it wasn't about that today - it was about fight and spirit.\"\nIn a game of few chances, the Clarets took the lead five minutes before half-time as Tarkowski deflected in Jack Cork's shot with his chest.\nBrighton failed to get going until the closing stages and rarely tested Joe Hart, though substitute Jurgen Locadia did spurn a great chance late on when he headed fellow substitute Glenn Murray's cross over the bar from six yards out.\nDefeat leaves Brighton 11th while Burnley climb to 17th.\nAsked about his post-match emotions, Dyche said: \"I think a bit of relief, and enjoyment. We know we can play better but sometimes you have to grind. We did enough to get by.\"\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action here.\nAs it happened: Burnley 1-0 Brighton.\nBurnley back to their gritty best\nOn 13 December 2017, Burnley beat Stoke to move into the Premier League's top four. Almost a year on, this victory also gave Dyche's side upward momentum, but only out of the bottom three.\nDespite their position in the lower reaches, though, there is cause for optimism for Dyche, with his side back to their gritty best.\nThe Clarets were much improved, controlling possession for much of the first half before making the breakthrough.\nBy the time Tarkowski scored, Brighton keeper Mat Ryan had already made two good saves in quick succession to deny Chris Wood and Robbie Brady, while Hart did not have a save to make in the opening 45 minutes.\nThe second half followed a similar pattern, with Brady's cross just eluding Wood at the back post shortly after the break, and Lewis Dunk forced to make a fantastic sliding block to clear Ashley Barnes' low shot.\nThe hosts had to be resilient late in the game, Tarkowski and Ben Mee standing firm under a barrage of pressure as Burnley conjured up memories of their efforts in 2017-18.\nVictory is Burnley's first since a 2-1 defeat of Cardiff on 30 September and comes before back-to-back away games against Tottenham and Arsenal.\nToothless Brighton fail to unpick Clarets\nAfter their impressive victory over Crystal Palace on Tuesday, Brighton should have been high in confidence coming into the game, but that did not seem to be the case.\nTheir first shot did not arrive until the 19th minute, when Yves Bissouma drove infield and dragged an effort well wide, and they struggled to make an impression in the first half.\nThey did improve after the break - having nearly 70% of the possession - but still did little to test Hart.\nIn fact, their sole attempt on target did not come until the 93rd minute - when Murray had a header easily saved.\nNeither Pascal Gross nor Davy Propper, who were both so influential in midweek, were unable to have a real impact as midfield counterparts Cork and Ashley Westwood took control.\nBut a position just outside the top half of the table at this stage of the season represents a solid start for Chris Hughton and his team.\n\"I thought our performance was really good,\" Hughton told Match of the Day.\n\"The only thing we were guilty of was having enough shots in the final third. On the balance of play I thought we were the better team.\"\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski\n'A massive day' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a hard-earned win and hard-fought. We never thought it would come from being free-flowing. We thought we would have to dig in and we have done that.\n\"A goal is a goal. When you find wins hard to come by and clean sheets hard to come by, 1-0 is a very pleasing result.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton, on Match of the Day: \"I thought we were the better side. I thought we had the better chances in the game. We were up against a direct Burnley with a lot of physicality. I thought we dealt with it very well.\n\"They are a team that plays a certain way. You know on second balls they will be good and strong and that is how they got their goal.\"\nBurnley goalscorer James Tarkowski, on Sky Sports: \"It was a tough afternoon. We had to get a goal and hold on. We know we have not been playing great recently so it was a massive day and big three points.\"\nSeagulls struggles on the road continue - the stats\nBrighton have won just two of their past 22 Premier League away games, drawing five and losing 15.\nThe three Premier League matches between these sides have produced just one goal.\nBurnley registered a clean sheet at Turf Moor for only the third time in their past 18 league games there.\nCork has had 'goal involvements' in consecutive Premier League appearances (assist v Brighton, goal v Liverpool) for the first time since March 2016 with Swansea.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley face a tricky test as they travel to Tottenham on Saturday, 15 December (15:00 GMT), before Brighton host Chelsea the following day (13:30)."

I never look down. I always tell the players they must have a winning mentality. They must decide to be a big team so we must be used to seeing what is happening in front of us.\"\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nThe best of the Premier League stats\nJames McArthur opened the scoring for Palace when prodding the ball past Lukasz Fabianski after reacting first to a James Tomkins knockdown.\nBut West Ham were a different proposition after the break. Snodgrass curled in an equaliser from just outside the penalty box and Hernandez put them ahead after Wayne Hennessey could only parry Anderson's free-kick.\nWest Ham's top scorer added a superb third, finding the top right corner from 20 yards - his sixth goal of the season.\nAlthough Palace reduced the deficit courtesy of Jeffrey Schlupp's header, they fell to 16th in the table.\nImproving Hammers win again\nIn the build-up to this contest, Pellegrini was at pains to point out the progress his side have made after their dismal start to the season.\nSince then, their form has been more that of a top-six outfit, and they have now won three games in succession for the first time since December 2016.\nPellegrini's side have lost only once in seven outings and appear to be displaying the signs of a team that have hit their stride after integrating nine summer signings.\nThe balance and shape of the team is now established, allowing Anderson - recruited for a club record \u00a336m from Lazio in the summer - to flourish.\nA peripheral figure during the opening weeks, the Brazilian winger has become a key player and has scored five goals in his past six games.\nHe had more sprints than any other player on the pitch on Saturday (21), and his pace was a concern throughout to promising Palace full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\nAnderson delivered the coup de grace for West Ham, his effort proving decisive in the face of a Palace fightback.\nPalace woes continue\nHaving made a bright start, Palace could have led 2-0 had Luka Milivojevic's wonderful free-kick not smashed against the crossbar at the end of the first half.\nThat proved a pivotal moment as West Ham overturned their one-goal deficit within three second-half minutes.\nRoy Hodgson's team have collected only one point and conceded 13 goals in their past six away games.\nThey simply had too few answers here, particularly in front of goal, mustering just four shots on target.\nWilfried Zaha looked bereft of confidence, twice passing up opportunities to shoot in favour of trying to work a better opening - losing possession on both occasions.\nThe Ivory Coast international has failed to score in 10 league matches.\nThere were pockets of good play and two goals - as many as they had managed in their previous 540 minutes of football - but all it delivered was a feel of respectability to the final score.\n\"We lost. I am not sure what assessment to make,\" Hodgson said.\n\"After they equalised we started to play better and had good control, but after the free-kick and strike from Anderson we find ourselves 3-1 down.\n\"We continued to ask questions but the two goals after the equaliser did for us.\"\nMan of the match - Felipe Anderson (West Ham)\nHernandez is a fox in the box - the stats\nWest Ham have won three consecutive top-flight matches whilst scoring 3+ goals in each game for the first time since October 1982.\nWest Ham have come from behind to win a Premier League game for the first time since their first match of 2018 against West Brom.\nAll 49 of Javier Hernandez's Premier League goals have come from inside the box. Only Tim Cahill (56) has scored more with 100% coming from inside the penalty area.\nThis was Crystal Palace's 50th defeat in a Premier League London derby in their 91st such match, the fastest London club to reach that total in the competition, overtaking Fulham's 99 games.\nThis was West Ham's first win in a London derby in the Premier League since they beat Chelsea 1-0 on 9 December 2017, 364 days ago.\nCrystal Palace have picked up just 12 points after 16 Premier League games this season. Only last season have they had fewer (11) after 16 games of a top-flight season in the era of three points for a win.\nRobert Snodgrass scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham, and his first for any club since January 2017, when he scored for Hull against West Brom, 705 days ago.\nFelipe Anderson has scored five goals in his last six league games, as many as his previous 34 combined for both the Hammers and Lazio.\nJames McArthur's opener was Crystal Palace's earliest goal scored in a Premier League game this season (on 5:41), with Wilfried Zaha against Brighton in April 2018 (4:39) the last to score a faster goal for the Eagles in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham's next Premier League assignment is away at Fulham on Saturday 15 December (17:30 GMT).\nCrystal Palace welcome Leicester to Selhurst Park for their next Premier League match, also on Saturday 15 December (15:00 GMT)"

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-0 Manchester City: Champions lose in league for first time this season\nManchester City were \"fantastic\" despite suffering a first Premier League defeat of the season at Chelsea, said manager Pep Guardiola.\nChelsea bounced back from the disappointment of losing at Wolves in midweek to end City's 21-game unbeaten league run stretching back to April, and a sequence of 14 unbeaten games away from home.\nThe defending champions paid for a lack of ruthlessness as they dominated the first half, only to be struck by a smash-and-grab right on half-time as N'Golo Kante fired high past Ederson from Eden Hazard's pass.\nChelsea gained confidence and momentum and improved after the break, securing the win with 12 minutes left when David Luiz's glancing header following a corner bounced in off the far post.\nThey closed out the win to give Sarri his first triumph over Guardiola, whose team are replaced at the top of the table by Liverpool.\nDespite slipping a point behind the Reds, the Spaniard rejected the notion his team had an \"off day\".\n\"If you think that, you didn't see the game,\" he told BBC Sport. \"In the first half, we were exceptional.\n\"In general, we were fantastic. I don't have any regrets. We came and showed we wanted to win. We created chances. They had one in 44 minutes and we conceded a goal. Sometimes that happens.\n\"It is emotional for me to see these players do what they do every three days. We were outstanding except for five to eight minutes.\"\nChelsea and police investigate allegation Sterling was racially abused\nAnalysis: What now for Premier League title race?\nCity pay for lacking killer touch\nCity's multi-talented squad can cover almost all eventualities, but this was a game in which they sorely missed the marksmanship of the injured Sergio Aguero, and also Kevin de Bruyne's creation.\nGuardiola's side were on another level to Chelsea for the first 44 minutes but when chances presented themselves, as they did to both Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane, there was either hesitation or an inability to provide the final product that proved crucial.\nThis is not a criticism of either Sterling or Sane but there was a lingering feeling that had the same opportunities fallen to the predatory Aguero, the outcome would have been different.\nCity could not recover from Kante's sucker punch, and it was Chelsea who were the more dangerous side in the second half.\nGuardiola's men must now regroup after a defeat that will be a major disappointment but one hardly likely to set them back for too long.\nKante proves Sarri's point\nKante's outstanding performance, including the opening goal, was vindication for Sarri's decision to play him in a new role this season.\nSarri has been questioned for his decision to use Jorginho as the hub of his team while pushing Kante into a more advanced role out on the right - why have the player many regard as the finest holding midfield player in world football and not utilise him there?\nSarri has stuck to his guns and this was a game - and performance by Kante - that added significant weight to his argument.\nThe World Cup winner was magnificent, typically tireless but also getting into forward positions, most decisively when he arrived on the end of Hazard's inviting pass to power a finish past Ederson that gave the Brazilian no chance.\nIt is certainly not the end of the argument, but evidence Sarri can use that he is coming up with the right formula.\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante\n'We deserved to win' - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri: \"I am very happy with the win because it is not very easy to win against Manchester City or Pep Guardiola. I am happy with the mentality of the team in this match.\n\"It is difficult for us to find motivation but when we have it, we are a very strong team. Today we played with a very good level of application, determination and the right level of aggression.\n\"My players have to continue like this. We started well in the second half and in the end we deserved to win.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"At this level and in the Champions League, the quality of the opponents means they only need a half a chance to score. That was the reality.\"\nFortress Stamford Bridge - the stats\nChelsea are unbeaten in 12 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge (W7 D5), their longest run without a home league defeat since a 21-game streak ending in August 2015.\nCity suffered their first Premier League defeat in 22 games, since a 3-2 loss to Manchester United in April. They also conceded more than one goal in a Premier League game for the first time since that match.\nThis was Sarri's first victory over Guardiola, ending a run of three defeats against the Spaniard in all competitions (W1 L3).\nGuardiola has lost three league games against Chelsea, more than against any other side as a manager.\nKante's opening goal came from Chelsea's first shot of the match in the 45th minute, the longest they have had to wait for a shot in a league game at Stamford Bridge since 2006-07.\nWith four 'goal involvements' in the Premier League this season (2 goals, 2 assists), Kante has already equalled his combined tally from his previous two top-flight seasons with Chelsea (2 goals, 2 assists in 69 games).\nHazard has provided an assist in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2014.\nHazard has now assisted a league-high eight goals in the Premier League this season - double the tally he assisted in 34 appearances last season (4).\nWhat next?\nBoth teams play in Europe in midweek, completing groups from which they have already qualified. City host Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Wednesday and Chelsea have a Europa League trip to Vidi on Thursday.\nIn the Premier League, City's home game against Everton is next Saturday's 12:30 GMT kick-off, while Chelsea travel to Brighton at 13:30 on Sunday."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Son Heung-min and Dele Alli secure comfortable win\nTottenham retained third place in the Premier League with a comfortable victory over a flat Leicester at the King Power Stadium.\nWith Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen both rested, Spurs initially struggled to break down the hosts until Son Heung-min's superb strike just before the break.\nThe South Korea forward cut in from the right and hit the top corner with a curling left-footed shot from outside the area.\nThe impressive Dele Alli then headed in Son's weighted cross after a flowing counter-attack to put the game beyond Leicester.\nSpurs had dropped to fifth after wins for Chelsea and Arsenal earlier on Saturday, but have moved back above their London rivals and are five points behind Manchester City in second, with leaders Liverpool a point further in front.\nTottenham now have 36 points after 16 matches, their highest ever tally at this stage in a Premier League season.\nLeicester stay ninth despite an end to their six-match unbeaten run in the league.\nRelive Spurs' win over Leicester\nNo Kane, no Eriksen, no problem\nIt is perhaps a mark of Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino's trust in the likes of Alli, Son and Lucas Moura that he felt able to leave Kane and Eriksen out of the starting side.\nSpurs' crucial Champions League group game away at Barcelona on Tuesday explains Pochettino's selection here, but this was still an important game against an in-form Leicester side, with the risk that the visitors could fall behind others near the top of the table.\nBut unlike the decision not to start Toby Alderweireld in the derby defeat by Arsenal last week, this gamble paid off as Alli, Moura and Son's blend of pace and skill proved too much for Leicester.\nAlli and Son provided the only sparks in an otherwise uninspiring first half - the former twice dancing through the Leicester defence only to be denied at the last, and the latter breaking the deadlock with a wonderful strike, the first either side had managed on target.\nCollecting a short pass from Serge Aurier on the right-hand edge of the box, Son feinted past Nampalys Mendy to create space before curving a terrific strike beyond Kasper Schmeichel.\nSon's start to the season was disrupted by his successful attempt to avoid military service in helping South Korea win the Asian Games, and he subsequently struggled for form. But he has been vital for Spurs recently, with three goals and three assists now in his last six league games.\nAlli, meanwhile, has seen his season interrupted by injuries, but he was back to near his best here, drifting between the lines and capping a fine showing with a goal - his 50th in all competitions for Tottenham.\nMoura brought the ball forward as Spurs worked a three-on-two, sliding it left to Son, who took his time, fashioned some room and picked out Alli with a terrific cross that the England midfielder met with a diving header past Schmeichel.\nEriksen and Kane did both enter the game in the final 25 minutes - replacing Moura and Son respectively - but by then Tottenham were coasting to victory.\nLeicester lack attacking edge\nIt was ultimately Leicester who were negatively affected by the absence of a talismanic English striker.\nWith Jamie Vardy missing his second straight game due to a groin problem, Kelechi Iheanacho rarely troubled Tottenham's experienced centre-back pairing of Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen.\nThe Foxes had more success early on playing through their quick, skilful wingers Demarai Gray and James Maddison, who were able to play in full-backs Ricardo Pereira and Ben Chilwell as they made surging runs on the overlap.\nYet the final cross or cutback was lacking each time, while Vertonghen also made several crucial interceptions and blocks.\nSubstitute Rachid Ghezzal provided some impetus after replacing Iheanacho on 56 minutes, but could not beat Hugo Lloris with a curling effort late on after cutting inside Harry Winks.\nLeicester were largely solid in defence, with captain Wes Morgan making a brilliant saving tackle to deny Alli as he ran through on goal.\nOverall, the Foxes are on a curious run - tough to beat but struggling to break teams down, having had to settle for draws against Brighton, Burnley and Fulham in recent weeks.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli (Tottenham)\nSpurs boss criticises Premier League - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"A very solid performance, I'm very pleased.\n\"It was an unbelievable moment and a great goal by Son. It was very important for our confidence to go into the second half believing we could win.\n\"I am bit surprised the Premier League put us in the position of playing at this time because we travel to Barcelona on Monday and that will be so tough.\n\"We didn't receive the help we needed from the Premier League but we are going to be ready to fight in Barcelona.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We started very well and it was a shame because we wasted good opportunities without the good clinical edge, the right pass or the right control.\n\"With more calm and more quality we could have had more opportunities in the first half. We were disappointed about our lack of clinical precision with the ball.\n\"We deserved to compete to the end against this team because it was a good start and we had good play.\"\nTottenham's sweetest 16 - the stats\nTottenham's tally of 36 points from 16 games is their best ever start to a Premier League season. Indeed, only twice before have they had a better total after 16 matches in a top-flight campaign (46 in 1960-61 and 37 in 1956-57 - based on three points for a win).\nSince they returned to the Premier League in 2014-15, Leicester have conceded 22 goals against Tottenham in the competition, more than they have against any other opponent.\nDele Alli's goal was his 50th in all competitions for Tottenham. Since the start of 2015-16, only Son Heung-min (52) and Harry Kane (117) have more for the club.\nAlli became the third player to score 50+ goals for Tottenham Hotspur in all competitions since 2015-16, alongside Son and Kane. No other Premier League club has more than two players who have done so in this time.\nSon has scored three goals in his last four league games. He had not netted in any of his previous 15.\nThis was the first time Tottenham had started a Premier League game with neither Christian Eriksen nor Harry Kane in their starting XI since 8 March 2014 against Chelsea, a 4-0 defeat under Tim Sherwood.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham face Barcelona at the Nou Camp in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) before hosting Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday, 15 December (15:00).\nLeicester are also in Premier League action at the same time on Saturday and are away at Crystal Palace."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 1-2 Wolves: Visitors score 95th-minute winner against 10 men\nThe Premier League needs video assistant referees now, Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez said after Wolves scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner against his 10-man side.\nMatt Doherty headed home the rebound after Diogo Jota's shot was pushed into his path in the 95th minute.\nAyoze Perez's superb header had pulled Newcastle level after Jota gave Wolves the lead before the break at St James' Park.\nMagpies defender DeAndre Yedlin was sent off by referee Mike Dean after 57 minutes - with the score at 1-1 - and Newcastle had a rejected penalty claim for a Willy Boly challenge on Perez.\n\"We need VAR now,\" said Benitez. \"In this game it would have changed everything. We were doing enough to control the game. How can you explain those decisions to all our fans?\"\nWhy this is a pivotal time for Newcastle - Chris Waddle analysis\nJota was outside the Newcastle area when he was brought down, with Jamaal Lascelles tracking back.\n\"The ball was far away [from goal] and there were other men close enough that it wasn't a red card,\" said Benitez.\n\"You can guarantee to me that the player in the corner of the box can score in the top corner every time? It cannot be a red card.\"\nVAR is set to be used in the Premier League next season, after clubs agreed in principle to their introduction.\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo said the red card \"changed the game\" and admitted his side were \"lucky to beat them in the end\".\n\"It's too difficult for me to judge because I'm on the other side of the pitch,\" he added.\nNewcastle forward Perez said: \"I'm not saying if it's a red card or not, but I'm pretty sure if it had been at the other end it wouldn't have been a red.\"\nNewcastle felt they should have had a penalty when Boly appeared to elbow Perez as he jumped for a header in the box.\nPlay was allowed to go on and Wolves almost scored from the resulting counter-attack, keeper Martin Dubravka diving to his right to keep out Doherty's curling effort.\nPerez received treatment on the pitch for a bloody nose.\n\"I don't know what we have to do to get a penalty but we just have to keep going,\" said Perez.\n\"The guy elbowed me really hard straight in my nose, but the referee said it was the ball that hit me, not the elbow, even though I was bleeding.\"\nBenitez said: \"It's so obvious. The red card and the elbow in Perez's face - we need the VAR.\"\nPersistence pays off as Jota impresses\nWolves' week could not have gone much better.\nThis victory came four days after they ended a run of seven league games without a victory by beating fourth-placed Chelsea 2-1.\nThey were made to work hard by Newcastle, who had the upper hand before Yedlin's dismissal.\nBut Jota was again influential, scoring his second goal in as many weeks and winning the free-kick which led to the sending-off. It was also his shot that was palmed into Doherty's path late on.\nDoherty had forced a diving save from Dubravka and Raul Jimenez hit the crossbar, before the former struck the decisive blow as the clock ticked down.\nVictory was Wolves' second in succession in the league - the first time they have secured back-to-back wins since early October.\nFor now, they can celebrate a place in the Premier League's top 10.\nFrustration for gutsy Newcastle\nNewcastle have now failed to win their past three Premier League games, but could easily have taken all three points against Wolves.\nThey were on the front foot from the start, Rondon forcing a save from Rui Patricio with a fizzing half-volley moments after kick-off before smashing the underside of the crossbar with a testing free-kick.\nAs well as having 60% of possession in the first half, Newcastle had 10 shots, four on target - a tally they have bettered only once this season.\nBut the game changed when Yedlin was sent off as Newcastle slipped to a seventh defeat in nine home games.\nThe best of the stats\nWolves have won six of their 16 Premier League games this season, more than they managed in the whole of their last top-flight campaign (five wins in 2011-12).\nNo team have had more 90th-minute winners this season than Wolves (2, also Man Utd), with Newcastle losing to a 90th-minute winner for the second time this season; more than any other side.\nAll seven meetings between Newcastle and Wolves in the Premier League have seen both teams score - it is the most-played fixture in the competition not to feature a clean sheet.\nOnly Everton (91) and Arsenal (86) have had more Premier League red cards than Newcastle (82).\nNewcastle have picked up just six points from their opening nine home Premier League games this campaign (P9 W2 D0 L7) - their worst start after nine home matches of a season in the top four tiers of English Football (previously eight points in 1957-58, assuming three points for a win).\nRondon has been directly involved in four of Newcastle's past six Premier League goals (3 goals, 1 assist), including the past three at St James' Park.\n'Enthusiasm disguises things'- what they said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"A late win. Enthusiasm disguises things - we didn't do the best performance. We allowed Newcastle to put us behind. We didn't win our duels or manage the possession of the ball.\n\"A draw was clearly the right result. The red card changes the game. We were lucky to beat them in the end. Don't always ask me about the referee please, it's a tough job.\"\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to Huddersfield on Saturday, 15 December (15:00 GMT), while Wolves host Bournemouth on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-2 Watford: Lucas Digne's late free-kick rescues point for hosts\nLucas Digne's injury-time free-kick earned Everton a point and denied Watford what would have been a sweet victory over former manager Marco Silva.\nSilva was sacked by Watford last season after an approach by Everton earlier in the campaign and the two clubs are still in dispute over the Portuguese boss.\nAnd Watford were on the brink of a deserved three points until France full-back Digne stepped up to send a perfect free-kick beyond Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster with only seconds left.\nEverton received the perfect start when another former Watford man, Richarlison, gave them an early lead - although the goal had a large slice of good fortune as Theo Walcott should have been given offside in the build-up.\nWatford were a threat all night and they capped a fine start to the second half with a 63rd-minute leveller when Roberto Pereyra's shot hit the post and rebounded in off Seamus Coleman.\nThey struck again two minutes later when the outstanding Abdoulaye Doucoure rose above Coleman at the far post to beat Jordan Pickford.\nEverton were flat throughout, their display summed up when they were awarded a penalty moments after Doucoure's goal when Christian Kabasele fouled Yerry Mina, only for Foster to save Gylfi Sigurdsson's tame penalty.\nWatford were holding on in relative comfort during six minutes of injury time until Digne's crucial last-ditch intervention.\nFollow all the reaction from Everton v Watford\nWatford so close to sweet victory\nThe sight of Watford players slumped on the turf as referee Kevin Friend blew the final whistle summed up the scale of their disappointment.\nThis game was played out against the backdrop of Silva's eventual departure from Vicarage Road last season, which came after Watford warned off Everton in the strongest terms, after they had made an approach for the man who is now in charge at Goodison Park.\nWatford's travelling fans made their displeasure known throughout with Silva the target for some colourful abuse.\nAnd their mood not improved when former striker Richarlison thumped a 15th-minute finish past Foster even though Walcott was clearly offside before Andre Gomes delivered the key pass.\n\"I told him [Richarlison] at the end it was the first goal I see because last season he didn't score one goal for me [at Watford] but then I wished him the best,\" Gracia said.\n\"I prefer not to say anything about the referees. If VAR was ready today the result would have been different.\"\nThe response of his side though said much about their character as they were a constant threat against a lack-lustre Everton.\nIt was no surprise when they equalised and they looked to be defending their lead with few alarms, Sigurdsson's penalty and a few scrambles apart, before Digne's fine free-kick.\nWatford look well organised under Gracia and Troy Deeney's physical approach, as well as their ability to be first to so many second balls, took them to within seconds of a win few would have begrudged them.\nLate show cannot disguise Everton's disappointment\nEverton won plaudits for the manner of their approach and performance after they lost to Divock Origi's 96th-minute winner in the Merseyside derby at Liverpool - but they have since delivered two poor performances at Goodison Park.\nSilva's side, who would have gone sixth with victory, laboured throughout and were somewhat fortunate to be rescued by Digne at the death.\nIt was a second successive draw after deadlock against Newcastle United here, which leaves Everton with two points from matches from which they might have expected a maximum return.\nSilva's side are currently too reliant on Richarlison for goals and they failed to capitalise on his early strike, relinquishing the initiative too easily to a Watford side only too happy to accept the invitation.\n\"We lost our focus completely [for Watford's goals],\" Silva said. \"Those two moments were not too special.\n\"We are not happy with the result. When you start like we start and achieve just one point, of course we are unhappy. Our goal for the match is completely different from the result.\"\nWalcott remains a frustrating figure, too often failing to provide end product and now looks low on confidence, while the likes of Cenk Tosun and Dominic Calvert-Lewin have not proved to be reliable goalscorers to augment the excellent Richarlison.\nIn the end they were happy to grab at the lifeline offered by Digne's late intervention, but if they are to build on the atmosphere and optimism that has accompanied them for much of this season, they have to perform better than this.\nMan of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford)\nWatford's woe at Goodison endures - the stats\n13 of the past 14 goals scored in Premier League clashes between Everton and Watford have come in the second half.\nWatford remain winless in all 13 of their league trips to Goodison Park against Everton (W0 D2 L11).\nOnly Burnley (nine) have conceded more Premier League goals in the 90th minute or later since the start of 2017-18 than Watford (eight - level with Southampton and West Ham).\nThere were just two minutes and 10 seconds between Watford's two goals in this game.\nAt 19 years and 22 days, Domingos Quina is the second-youngest player to start a Premier League game for Watford after Al Bangura in December 2006 v Reading (18y 319d).\nEverton's Richarlison is the fourth different player to both score a Premier League goal both for and against Watford, after Ashley Young, Heidar Helguson and Daryl Janmaat.\nEverton full-back Seamus Coleman has scored two own goals in his past three Premier League appearances against Watford.\nEverton playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson has failed to convert two of his past three Premier League penalties as an Everton player, after scoring each of the six before that whilst at Swansea City.\nLucas Digne's equaliser for Everton was the second-latest goal in the Premier League this season at 95:08, behind only Ross Barkley's strike for Chelsea against Manchester United in October (95:27).\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Manchester City in their next Premier League outing on Saturday, 15 December (12:30 GMT), while Watford host Cardiff on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-1 Everton: Gabriel Jesus & Raheem Sterling put hosts top of Premier League\nGabriel Jesus said his mother's arrival in England has improved his confidence as he ended his Premier League goal drought to help Manchester City return to the top of the table.\nJesus had not scored a league goal since August - a run of 11 games and 487 minutes - but netted twice before Raheem Sterling added City's third.\nThe Brazil forward, who signed for City in 2017 and extended his contract until 2023 earlier this season, has recently been joined in Manchester by his mother.\n\"My confidence is back because my family is here with me,\" said the 21-year-old.\n\"They help me a lot. It is easy for me because they are everything. I need my family in this moment.\"\nCity manager Pep Guardiola said: \"He settled so well from the beginning - but it is much better his family is here and strikers need to score goals.\n\"He scored two nice goals that will be important for him.\"\nCity will stay top for at least another day, with Liverpool needing to beat Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday (16:00 GMT kick-off) to reclaim their place at the summit.\nThis victory, City's 10th in a row at home in the league, was rarely in serious doubt once Jesus had fired his side ahead on a bitterly cold day at Etihad Stadium.\nYerry Mina's misplaced pass allowed Ilkay Gundogan to find Leroy Sane in space, and he sent Jesus galloping into the area to score with a fine low finish.\nJesus only had to wait another 28 minutes for his second of the game.\nWhen it arrived just after half-time, Sane was the provider again - with Jesus meeting his precise cross to plant an unstoppable header past Toffees keeper Jordan Pickford.\nCity looked in complete control but Everton gave themselves hope just after the hour when Dominic Calvert Lewin met Lucas Digne's cross to reduce the deficit.\nThe visitors were only briefly back in it, however, with substitute Sterling - a week after suffering alleged racial abuse during City's defeat at Chelsea - heading in Fernandinho's cross four minutes later with his first touch.\nIt was enough to ensure City, whose loss at Stamford Bridge last weekend was their first in the league this season, are back in a familiar position at the top.\nKevin de Bruyne, back from a knee injury that has kept him out of action since 1 November, also came off the bench before the end to give the home fans further reason to cheer.\nRelive Man City's win at the Etihad\nAll of Saturday's other Premier League action\nDe Bruyne back and Aguero on the bench\nThe hard work was done by the time De Bruyne emerged from the relative warmth of the bench with 16 minutes remaining, but the welcome he received from the home fans showed how pleased they were to see him back.\nBefore Saturday's game, the Belgium midfielder had played only 236 minutes out of a possible 2,250 in 2018-19 because of injuries to both of his knees.\nThis was only his sixth appearance of the season, with Guardiola hoping that will mean the27-year-old will be \"fresh\" for the busy festive period.\nDe Bruyne's return was not the only good news for Guardiola, with striker Sergio Aguero fit enough to be among the substitutes after missing the past four games with a groin problem.\nIn the end the Argentine was not needed but, like De Bruyne, he will surely have a big part to play in the weeks ahead.\n\"The players responded [to defeat at Chelsea] in a marvellous way,\" Guardiola said.\n\"Everton have top players. Today was tricky - a dangerous, dangerous game.\n\"They drew at Stamford Bridge, at Liverpool it came down to the last second. I am very pleased.\"\nEverton show plenty of attacking ambition\nEverton have now gone four games without a win but with better finishing they could at the very least have made the scoreline closer on Saturday.\nRicharlison, so often their hero this season, was first to blame when he blasted wastefully over after arriving in space to meet Digne's cross at the back post.\nThat was the Toffees only effort at goal in the first half, but they were much more lively once they had fallen 2-0 down after the break.\nThe Toffees have chiefly relied on Richardson and Gylfi Sigurdsson for their goal threat this term, but Calvert-Lewin was a handful throughout.\nHe has only scored twice since the start of September but could have had two in 45 minutes here, if not for a fine Ederson save to keep out his clever flick.\nEverton manager Marco Silva bemoaned the missed chances after the match.\n\"Until the moment they scored the game was what we expected,\" said the Portuguese.\n\"We were blocking them and they didn't create one chance before they scored the first goal.\n\"The biggest chance was our chance with Richarlison. Against this team we have to be effective when we create moments to score.\n\"We made a mistake with the first goal, they scored and after that they were more comfortable.\"\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Man City)\nCity's fine home run - the best stats\nManchester City have won all 21 of their games this season when they have scored in the first half. The only five games they have not won this term are the five in which they have not scored in the first half.\nCity have won their past 10 Premier League home games, scoring 36 and conceding seven goals.\nEverton have won only one of their past nine away league matches, losing five.\nSince Guardiola became City manager, Everton have scored more Premier League goals against them - eight - than any other team.\nSane set up both of Jesus' goals on Saturday, his first two assists in the league for the Brazilian.\nCity forward Sterling scored only his second headed goal in the Premier League, and his first since one against Sunderland in December 2015.\nSince the start of last season, no Everton player has scored more goals than Calvert-Lewin (13, level with Sigurdsson).\nWhat's next?\nCity continue their defence of the Carabao Cup at Leicester on Tuesday (19:45) and return to the Etihad next Saturday to host Crystal Palace in their final league game before Christmas (15:00).\nEverton host Tottenham in their next Premier League game on Sunday, 23 December (16:00)."

At the moment we are playing very well, consistently, but don't have the right result. They had one chance and took it.\"\nHuddersfield remain 18th and have now lost nine of their last 13 league games.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nHuddersfield v Newcastle as it happened\nMagpies grind out crucial win\nLast weekend's agonising 95th-minute Wolves winner left Newcastle winless in three league games following their November revival, adding extra importance to a meeting with fellow strugglers Huddersfield.\nThe Magpies' vital winning run in November saw manager Rafael Benitez receive the Premier League manager of the month award earlier this week, but that defeat by Wolves prompted Benitez to label each of his side's upcoming games as akin to \"a final\".\nIndeed, the Magpies players cancelled their Christmas party for a second successive year due to their league situation - which now looks substantially healthier.\nNewcastle enjoyed just 26% possession at the Kirklees Stadium and spent the majority of the match firmly in their own half as Huddersfield looked much the more ambitious in approach.\nWhen the visitors did venture forward in the first half, Jonas Lossl smothered Fabian Schar's close-range attempt.\nThe decisive strike came from another rare but slick move, as Ayoze Perez and Javier Manquillo combined on the right to set-up the in-form Rondon.\nDespite more Huddersfield pressure, Newcastle remained defensively solid and stuck to their task to earn what often appeared an unlikely victory, and one which could prove huge in the context of their season.\n\"Against a team so close to us in the table, and to get three points, it was a good achievement,\" said Benitez.\n\"This group of players deserves credit and today they came together and worked hard. We gave the ball away a little bit in the first half, but in the second half we were better organised. The idea was to exploit them on the counter-attack and exploit the space behind them.\"\nDefeat tough to take for Terriers\nThe result, judged on the balance of play, was harsh on Huddersfield, but four straight league defeats have left David Wagner's side in a precarious league position going into the busy festive period.\nThe hosts' attitude and approach could not be faulted, and they looked the only side likely to find a breakthrough in a positive first-half display.\nFor all their good build-up play, though, the Premier League's lowest scorers once again lacked quality in the final third.\nAlex Pritchard, Juninho Bacuna and Billing all offered energy around targetman Laurent Depoitre in attack, but the outcome summed up the Terriers' campaign to date.\nThe news playmaker Aaron Mooy will be out until the new year with injury is a huge blow to Huddersfield, who have now failed to score in 29 Premier League games since the start of last season.\n\"We played some good football today and in recent weeks as well,\" added Wagner.\n\"Today was different because we did not have clear-cut chances but how the players played and defended, their bravery and intensity to be on the front foot, was great.\"\nMan of the match - Alex Pritchard (Huddersfield)\nNewcastle keeping things tight - the stats\nNewcastle United's Premier League games have seen 36 goals scored this season, 14 for and 22 against, fewer than any other side.\nNewcastle are unbeaten in four consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since November 2012.\nHuddersfield have won just two of their last 14 games against Newcastle in all competitions, losing eight.\nSince the start of last season, Huddersfield have failed to score in 29 Premier League games, eight more than any other side.\nHuddersfield posted a 73.6% possession figure in this game, the highest of any side to lose a Premier League game this season.\nWhat's next?\nIn another key weekend at the bottom, Huddersfield host Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Newcastle face Fulham at the same time."

We cannot keep playing like this every week and losing - we need to get results away from home.\"\nWatford v Cardiff as it happened\nWatford survive a scare\nWatford had lost their two previous home games before the visit of Cardiff but their performance was far superior to that of a side who, prior to kick-off, had picked up just nine points from their past 12 games.\nDeulofeu was at the heart of much of their play and his goal - described by Garth Crooks on Final Score as 'Diego Maradona-esque' - was richly deserved as Cardiff struggled to contain their opponents.\nIn a moment of magic, he jinked his way past two defenders before neatly placing the ball past Etheridge.\nRoberto Pereyra - Watford's top scorer this season with five goals - was not without his chances either and went close not long after Deulofeu's opener, a poor final touch letting him down.\nWatford went into half-time having enjoyed 75% of the first-half possession and, with moves straight off the training ground, added two more goals after the break, the second, a stunning curling effort from Holebas the pick of the bunch.\nBut they quickly became complacent after Quinas' third - his first Premier League goal - and Cardiff made them pay for the change in pace with two quickfire goals.\nWatford could have had a fourth in added time but for another late save by Etheridge.\nEtheridge proves Cardiff's hero\nJust two places separated Watford and Cardiff in the table before kick-off but the first half demonstrated a real gulf in class between the two sides.\nBut despite the defeat, Cardiff head home with a lot to thank goalkeeper Etheridge for. He produced save after save, single-handedly preventing Pereyra from scoring a hat-trick with less than an hour played.\nDespite their lacklustre first-half performance, they weren't without their chances though and Harry Arter almost played Josh Murphy in on goal with a sliding cross midway through.\nA rare moment of Watford carelessness was capitalised on by the visitors as Quina played the ball straight into their possession and Hoilett was able to put in a cross, which floated just high of Callum Paterson in the box.\nIt was in the second half that they found another gear with some slick play involving Nathaniel Mendez-Laing putting the pressure on the hosts.\nHoilett had a chance on goal before his and his side's perseverance was rewarded when he curled the ball in past Ben Foster, before Reid capitalised on a scramble in the box to poke home.\nWatford 'taught a good lesson' - what Gracia said\nReferee a 'Sunday trainee' - what Warnock said\nMan of the match - Gerard Deulofeu (Watford)\nThe stats\nThis was Watford's first win in seven Premier League games (D2 L4), since beating Huddersfield 3-0 in October.\nCardiff scored twice in an away Premier League game for the first time this season, last doing so in March 2014 vs West Brom (3-3).\nWatford (2) vs Cardiff (1) was the first Premier League match to see three goals scored from outside the box this season.\nAt 19 years and 27 days, Domingos Quina became Watford's youngest ever Premier League goalscorer.\nAbdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 registered his fifth Premier League assist this season - only Troy Deeney in 2015-16 (7) has provided more for Watford in a single campaign.\nWatford's Jos\u00e9 Holebas has been directly involved in more goals than any other Premier League defender this season (7 - 3 goals, 4 assists).\nGerard Deulofeu both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time with Watford, last doing so in November 2015 for Everton against Sunderland.\nCardiff's Junior Hoilett has scored two goals in his last four Premier League games - more than he'd managed in his previous 61 in the competition (1).\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to West Ham in their next Premier League outing on Saturday, 22 December (15:00 GMT), while Cardiff welcome Manchester United to Wales (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Premier League: Wolves beat Bournemouth 2-0\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said his side must show \"big character\" after a sixth defeat in seven games saw opponents Wolves climb above them into seventh.\nRaul Jimenez got his fifth goal of the season for the opener, turning in Diogo Jota's deflected shot after a bad Charlie Daniels error.\nIt was a gift of a goal that came against the run of play and from the first half's only attempt on target before Jefferson Lerma hit a tame shot in added time.\nJota picked up an injury and was replaced at the break by Helder Costa, who should have doubled Wolves' lead but fired rashly wide with only Asmir Begovic to beat.\nBournemouth top scorer Callum Wilson returned from injury shortly after as a substitute, but it was Junior Stanislas who almost found the equaliser with a free-kick that rattled Rui Patricio's crossbar.\nIn driving rain, Howe's side dominated possession with much of the match played in Wolves' half, but they failed to find a way through a solid defence.\nAnd they were punished on the break as they threw everything forward in injury time, with substitute Ivan Cavaleiro finishing coolly in an easy one-on-one set up by Costa's pass on the halfway line.\n\"A lot of our build-up play was very good, but the killer instinct wasn't. We didn't create many real clear-cut chances. We've got to be very strong, show big character and come through this bad form,\" Howe told BBC Sport.\n\"Confidence is such a delicate thing. You can't overestimate the importance of losing key individuals to injury but that's no excuse, that's what you have a squad for.\n\"We dominated the ball today and made two big mistakes for the goals. Wolves are very good at soaking pressure and hitting on the counter. It was a frustrating afternoon.\"\nWolves are now one point behind sixth-placed Manchester United, who play away to Liverpool on Sunday, while Bournemouth slip to 11th.\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive Wolves v Bournemouth\nWolves' tight defence impresses again\nIn their previous top flight season in 2011-12, Wolves finished on 25 points and were relegated as the bottom side.\nThey have already matched that points total thanks to Saturday's win and victories against Chelsea at home and Newcastle away. It is the first time Wolves have won three in a row in the top flight since 1980.\nJota scored two goals in those previous two wins and he played a big role in the opener at Molineux on Saturday.\nFrom a certain angle he looked to have cleverly disguised a shot to pick out Jimenez to his right, but in fact it was a deflected effort that clipped Steve Cook's heels and fell favourably to the Mexico striker for an easy finish.\nHowever, Jota was taken off at the break after emerging injured from a collision with Cook when he was clear on goal. The referee decided Cook's challenge was fair, although Jota appeared to land awkwardly.\nPerhaps if the 22-year-old Portuguese winger had not been forced off, Wolves would have threatened more after the break. Instead, Nuno Espirito Santo's side once more relied on their impressively solid defence before sealing the points with Cavaleiro's simple 94th-minute winner.\nIn terms of expected goals, the value Opta uses to judge the quality of chances a defence concedes, only Liverpool and Manchester City have a better record than Wolves so far this season.\nDaniels' mistake defines match\nBournemouth went into this game with just one win from their past six matches.\nThe run began in November with a home defeat by Manchester United which Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho described as \"lucky\". The Cherries then enjoyed plenty of good fortune themselves in their only win during this sorry recent run - 2-1 at home to Huddersfield.\nBut at Molineux, they only had themselves to blame.\nHowe may be wondering how the afternoon might have ended had Stanislas' curled free-kick found the net instead of the top of Wolves' crossbar. But the match-defining moment was Daniels' error.\nFrom a Bournemouth throw-in in their own half, he half-volleyed a pass across the pitch straight to Jota, who took full advantage by running on goal and forcing Jimenez's opener.\nAnd for all their slick passing in front of Wolves' goal, quality was always missing at the crucial moment. Stanislas fired rashly over the bar when well placed in the box, and Joshua King and Wilson both had promising chances closed down.\nThe only efforts on target for the away side were a tame Cook header and two speculative long-range Jefferson Lerma shots.\nMan of the match - Raul Jimenez (Wolves)\n'I'm very proud' - what the managers said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo:\n\"In this weather, with the wind, cold and rain and against Bournemouth - I'm very proud. We did a fantastic job.\n\"Before we were in a bad moment. Now we're in a good moment. It's important to realise why. The boys' character, the way they commit to the work on a daily basis, well done to them.\n\"It was hard for every player on the pitch. Both teams matched each other.\n\"The main thing today was staying compact and robust. I'm very proud of the work we do every day and the character the boys showed.\"\nFinally a first-half goal - the stats\nThis was Wolves' first victory against Bournemouth in all competitions since December 1989, having failed to win any of their previous five meetings (D2 L3).\nSince keeping three consecutive clean sheets in October, Bournemouth have conceded in each of their past seven Premier League games (16 goals in total).\nJimenez's opener for Wolves was their first goal scored during the first half of a Premier League game at Molineux since Ruben Neves netted against Everton on the opening day.\nAll five of Jimenez's Premier League goals for Wolves this season have been scored at Molineux.\nJota has been directly involved in three goals in his past three Premier League appearances for Wolves (two goals, one assist) having failed to score or assist in his previous 13 such games this season.\nWhat's next?\nWolves host Liverpool in the league on Friday, kick-off 20:00 GMT.\nBournemouth travel to Chelsea in the EFL Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday, kick-off 19:45, before welcoming Brighton in the league on Saturday at 15:00."

It was a late victory but so important for us.\"\nIt looked as if the Clarets would come away with a deserved point following a tremendous defensive display. They limited Spurs to a handful of clear-cut chances, with Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min both going close, while Hart produced a magnificent save to deny Erik Lamela.\nThe victory moves third-placed Spurs to 39 points and within three of Liverpool in second. Burnley remain in 17th with 12 points - two points above the relegation zone.\nSpurs rewarded for their patience\nPerseverance paid off for Tottenham in midweek and it did so again against Burnley.\nMauricio Pochettino's men tried several combinations to unlock the visiting defence, but time and time again they were thwarted. Most of their forays broke down on the edge of the area.\nThey did, though, break through on a handful of occasions, with Moura and substitute Son going close. The Brazilian, the hero against the Catalans last Tuesday, poked a volley wide before Son's angled drive just missed Hart's far post.\nIn between those two chances, Hart pulled off a superb stop to deny Lamela.\nWith seconds remaining Pochettino, wearing a woolly hat in wet Wembley conditions, looked a beaten man until one of his generals raised his spirits and brought the home support to their feet.\nIt was striker Harry Kane the provider, as he laid the ball into the path of Eriksen, who fired his shot beyond the reach of Hart.\nClarets' resilience unrewarded\nThe result was cruel on Burnley.\nThis was the sort of resolute performance against one of the 'Big Six' we got used to seeing from Sean Dyche's side last season. They defended from the front and restricted the space for attacking players Kane, Dele Alli and Lamela by hunting them down in pairs.\nThis focus on defence meant Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris had a quiet time at the other end. The Frenchman did, however, suffer one of his lapses in concentration when his poor pass out of defence was almost punished by a header from Ashley Barnes.\nBarnes also had a scissor-kick inside the area blocked by Kane in the first half.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\n'I feel for the players' - What they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche on BBC's Match of the Day: \"Obviously we are frustrated and disappointed in the outcome but a lot of positives. My only gripe is we get done by a whack down the pitch.\n\"Inevitably we didn't deal with that final moment and they nick a goal. There were good signs from the mentality we know we have to win games. There is a resilience and organisation but we are playing a top side - it is difficult to come down here.\n\"Away from home against sides like this you have got to try and model a team that can still get a result. I feel for the players because they put a proper shift in today and did the basics well. The last three or four games we are getting back to what we can be - we need more attacking prowess but it is difficult.\"\nPoch wins his 100th league match - the stats\nNone of Tottenham's past 21 Premier League games have ended in a draw, with Spurs winning 16 and losing five since a 1-1 at Brighton in April.\nOnly Bolton in 2011-12 (18) have had a longer run without a draw from the start of a Premier League campaign than Spurs this season (17).\nBurnley failed to register a single shot on target in this match. It's the third time they've done so in the Premier League this season - no other side has done so more than once.\nLamela had 47% of Tottenham's shots in this match (7/15) and 67% of their shots on target (two out three).\nEriksen scored Tottenham's first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League since April 2017 (Son v Swansea).\nEriksen's goal was his first for Tottenham as a sub in the Premier League, in his 10th appearance from the bench in the competition.\nPochettino won his 100th Premier League match as Tottenham manager in his 169th game with them in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham have a Carabao Cup quarter-final tie at arch-rivals Arsenal on Wednesday (19:45 GMT), and Burnley are at the Gunners next Saturday (12:30 GMT).\nRelive the action from Wembley Stadium\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League action"

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-0 Leicester: Luka Milivojevic earns Eagles win\nCrystal Palace secured their first Premier League victory without Wilfried Zaha in over two years thanks to captain Luka Milivojevic's superb strike in a scrappy win against Leicester at Selhurst Park.\nBoth sides struggled to create chances in a drab first half until Milivojevic beat Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel from 25 yards out with a powerful, curving shot.\nJamie Vardy earlier had a goal disallowed for a foul on Vicente Guaita as the returning striker caught the Palace keeper, making his Premier League debut, dawdling on the ball.\nAfter the interval, Guaita made a fine save to deny Vardy - flicking the ball onto the inside of the post and claiming the rebound.\nThat was as close as Leicester came, with Demarai Gray and substitute Rachid Ghezzal both sliding efforts narrowly wide.\nPalace also failed to exploit the openings they found but held firm under concerted pressure in the closing stages to claim a potentially vital win and move five points clear of the relegation zone.\nRelive the action from Selhurst Park\nAll of Saturday's Premier League action\nPalace break Zaha curse\nPalace had lost their previous 13 league matches without talismanic winger Zaha - who was suspended on Saturday - a run stretching back to a 3-2 victory at Sunderland in September 2016.\nThe hosts still sorely missed him against Leicester, with Andros Townsend and Jordan Ayew both working hard but lacking Zaha's creativity.\nDespite not carrying much threat up front, Palace got through with a resolute performance from their defence and midfield, and a moment of exquisite quality.\nTownsend and Aaron Wan-Bissaka worked the ball down the right but could not find a way through. It found its way to Milivojevic in a more central position and the Serbia midfielder took a touch before hitting a fine, arcing shot into the far corner.\nElsewhere, James McArthur, freed up from his nominal role on the right of a midfield four to run in between the lines, was excellent and caused Leicester problems.\nAnd Martin Kelly - in for the suspended James Tomkins - epitomised a largely solid defensive display from the hosts, routinely beating Vardy to head clear Leicester crosses.\nEagles still need a goalscorer\nPalace will not be able to rely on sublime strikes from central midfielders all season and manager Roy Hodgson, despite his pre-match claim there are already \"players within our ranks who can score goals\", should consider signing a goalscorer in January.\nPalace have just five goals in eight league games at home this season, with only Huddersfield scoring fewer.\nAyew was a willing runner throughout - a little too keen in straying offside several times - but he and Townsend lack a clinical edge, with both having shots blocked when free on the edge of the Leicester area.\nDespite his overall importance, Zaha has not offered much of a goal threat this season either - the Ivorian has failed to score since netting three times in his first four appearances.\nChristian Benteke is still to come back from injury but only scored three times in a poor 2017-18 season, while Alexander Sorloth is yet to score in the league since joining in January.\nConnor Wickham is also close to a return to the starting side but it may be asking a lot of him to provide the goals Palace will need to avoid a nervy relegation battle after a torrid spell out with a serious knee injury.\nMan of the match - James McArthur (Crystal Palace)\nLeicester still lacking\nThe Foxes are a curious side to watch this season.\nThey have an assured goalkeeper, a solid defence, two capable defensive midfielders, tricky wingers and the menacing pace of Vardy up front.\nAnd yet they are adding up to less than the sum of those parts. As a result, they are 11th in the table on 22 points, having scored and conceded 21 goals.\nFollowing defeat by Spurs last time out, they were flat again on Saturday and never really did enough to justify an equaliser - apart from Vardy's misfortune at seeing his poked effort not deflect in off the inside of the post after Guaita's save on 79 minutes.\nManager Claude Puel made a change at half-time, bringing Rachid Ghezzal on for James Maddison and pushing Gray up front before later replacing him with Kelechi Iheanacho.\nHowever, aside from a fine run by Gray and Vardy's chance, it made little difference, with the visitors only mustering two shots on target against a supposedly vulnerable Palace side.\n'We ground it out' - reaction\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson, speaking to BBC Sport: \"In the first half I thought we were very good.\n\"We lost Cheikhou Kouyate in the second half and when he had come off it handed the ascendancy to Leicester. We then had to make certain we worked hard and ground out the victory.\n\"We did not concede that many chances - the one we did that I thought they would score we had a stroke of fortune.\n\"Martin Kelly deserves a special mention. To come in with not many games behind him and play like he did, he deserves an enormous pat on the back.\"\nLeicester boss Claude Puel, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We did not start the game with the right intensity. We played a poor first half, it was not enough.\n\"We came back in the second half with a good intensity and quality. We had three or four chances to come back into the game. We deserved to come back but it is a big disappointment because we need the points.\n\"We were unlucky at the end but we lost three points. It is important to correct this and to play a consistent game from the start until the end.\"\nLeicester do not like London - stats\nCrystal Palace have won consecutive home league games for the first time since their final three matches at Selhurst Park in 2017-18.\nLeicester are without a win in their past 10 Premier League visits to London (D4 L6), since a 3-2 win against West Ham in March 2017.\nPalace have won and kept a clean sheet in their past three league games against Leicester.\nSince his Premier League debut in February 2017, Luka Milivojevic has scored more goals in the competition for Crystal Palace than any other player.\nAndros Townsend has been directly involved in three goals in his past two league matches for Palace at Selhurst Park (one goal, two assists), one more than he managed in his previous 14.\nWhat's next?\nPalace are away at Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday, 22 December (kick-off 15:00 GMT).\nLeicester face Chelsea at the same time, but before that play City in the EFL Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday (kick-off 19:45)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-2 West Ham: Hammers win again to keep hosts bottom of league\nWest Ham earned a fourth consecutive Premier League win for the first time in almost five years to keep toothless Fulham bottom of the table.\nThe Cottagers, who have not kept a clean sheet all season, wasted several chances in the first half while falling asleep to let the Hammers take the lead with their first two shots.\nRobert Snodgrass curled the visitors into the lead from Felipe Anderson's pass, and Michail Antonio was left unmarked to double the advantage.\nAnderson almost scored late on with the second half's only shot on target, but his effort was saved by Sergio Rico.\nFulham - who created very little after the break - have won once in Claudio Ranieri's five games in charge so far.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nDamaging defeat leaves Fulham looking to January transfer window\nFulham's problem this season has been leaking goals - they are the only team in England's top four divisions to not keep a single clean sheet.\nBut their issues at Craven Cottage on Saturday were as much to do with their finishing.\nFulham had 12 shots in the first half to West Ham's two, excluding blocked efforts.\nAboubakar Kamara wasted the best chance when his one-on-one effort was saved by Lukasz Fabianski. The striker had a header and a long-range effort stopped, while the keeper also kept out Aleksandar Mitrovic's 20-yard deflected strike.\nJean Michael Seri, Andre Schurrle and Tom Cairney all missed the target with shots from outside the box.\nThey could have stopped Anderson in the build-up - or closed down Snodgrass - to the opening goal and nobody picked up Antonio for the second.\nRanieri said \"of course\" the goals were avoidable, adding: \"They scored very easily twice. A counter-attack, we have to stay calm and we run to get the ball and that's not right.\"\nTheir luck appeared to be summed up when Denis Odoi and Alfie Mawson injured themselves while trying to stop Anderson, although they could both continue after treatment.\nFulham never looked like threatening any kind of comeback in the second half, and did not force any saves from the West Ham keeper.\nThey had won once in Ranieri's first four games - his opening match against Southampton. But that run included games at Chelsea and Manchester United - with two of the previous three defeats at Manchester City and Liverpool.\nHowever, three of their four games before the new year - including this one - are at home, with none against the Premier League's elite clubs.\nDespite conceding 42 goals in 17 Premier League games, Fulham remain only three points adrift of safety.\nHaving spent \u00a3100m in the summer following promotion to get them ready for the Premier League, they are likely to be able to afford more spending in January.\nAnd, on the basis of the season so far, they could do with significant reinforcements throughout the team.\nRanieri said after the game that it was \"too early to speak about\" January transfers - but added owner Shahid Khan \"understands we have to do something\".\nWest Ham maintain impressive form\nThe Hammers, under Manuel Pellegrini, appear to have found their feet after a shaky run of form and are suddenly dreaming of Europe.\nThey had won their previous three matches, scoring three times in each, and are up to ninth in the league - two points off sixth-placed Manchester United - after their latest victory.\nThey were highly clinical at Craven Cottage, with Snodgrass scoring a brilliant opener and Javier Hernandez flicking on Anderson's cross to find Antonio free to double their lead.\nUnited only had one more effort on target - Anderson's late chance - and they were relatively comfortable winners as the second half proved a non-event.\nThey are now enjoying their best run since February 2014, when they won all four Premier League games under Sam Allardyce.\n\"That was a good performance because maybe we didn't create many chances, but the ones we did create, we scored,\" Pellegrini told BBC Match of the Day. \"In the second half we did well. We kept a clean sheet.\n\"We have eight players injured. We will see what will happen in January, but I'm very happy with the squad. We have four or five players who might not play again this season.\n\"Four games in a row is not easy for any team. Now we must try to continue with our feet on the floor. We will continue working. We are two points behind the European spots but there are 21 games left.\"\nMatch stats - Hernandez's first Premier League assist in four years\nFulham have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last 21 Premier League games, conceding at least twice in 18 of those games (53 goals in total).\nWest Ham have won more Premier League London derbies this season (two) than they did in the whole of 2017-18 (one).\nSnodgrass has been directly involved in five goals in his last four Premier League games (two goals, three assists), after previously going 16 games without a goal or assist in the competition.\nAnderson has been involved in more Premier League goals this season than any other West Ham player (eight - six goals, two assists).\nHernandez got his first assist in the Premier League since April 2014, when he set up Juan Mata for Manchester United against Newcastle.\nMan of the match - Felipe Anderson (West Ham)\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are at home to Watford next Saturday (15:00 GMT), looking to make it five wins in a row.\nFulham visit Newcastle at the same time as they continue their search for a first Premier League clean sheet since April 2014."

His accompanying letter promised an \"intensive and very hard-working\" environment and his players responded by trumping Arsenal's quality with industry and tenacity.\nIngs, whose last headed Premier League goal was for Liverpool in Brendan Rodgers' final match in charge back in October 2015, looked a potent aerial threat, finding space in between Arsenal's three-man defence to score his two goals.\nAlso heartening for a team at the wrong end of the table, the Saints defence was galvanised.\nJan Bednarek typified their whole-hearted commitment, sliding in to steal the ball as Pierre Emerick Aubameyang was poised to put Arsenal ahead in the first half.\nHasenhuttl lived every moment on the touchline, visibly reminding himself to stay off the pitch as he celebrated Ings' first, before ultimately giving way to his emotion at the final whistle.\n\"I heard when it works like this you have to do it every game at home,\" he said afterwards of his free drinks for the home fans. \"We'll have a look.\"\nArsenal's patchy defence comes up short\nFor all the improvements made by Arsenal under Unai Emery, they have an unwelcome habit of making sluggish starts.\nThey are yet to lead at half-time in a Premier League match this season and finally, against a revved-up Southampton, they found they had left themselves with too much to do.\nEmery's initial solution to his defensive shortages may not have helped.\nWith Rob Holding and Konstantinos Mavropanos injured and Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi suspended, Emery opted for a makeshift back three of the recently-returned Laurent Koscielny, midfield specialist Granit Xhaka and 34-year-old Stephan Lichtsteiner.\nAn enforced change of tactics - with the injured Hector Bellerin replaced by Alexandre Lacazette as the Gunners reverted to a back four - gave them them more impetus after the interval.\nArsenal immediately looked more dangerous with Aubameyang's goal-bound shot cleared by Vestergaard before Lacazette picked the pocket of Oriel Romeu to set up Mkhitaryan's shooting position for the second.\nThey forced Southampton deep, but not beyond breaking point, and, when goalkeeper Bernd Leno misjudged Long's teasing cross, their unbeaten run - which had stretched back to August - was over.\nMan of the match - Jan Bednarek\n'Very intensive' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"It's amazing what the team can do in a week. It was very intensive, we had time to work on the basics and built the fundamentals for our game.\n\"I'm very proud of how focused and uncompromising they were, and when they had the chances, how merciless they were.\n\"It was a fantastic atmosphere and a special feeling here to win the match.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"We could have lost at any time and it was today.\n\"If we won't win like today, we cannot be in the top four.\n\"After 22 matches unbeaten we didn't lose and we are only fifth position in the table and the reason is because other teams are very well.\n\"Other teams usually they are winning but we need to do our way and continue to build. The objective is therefore top but we know it's not easy because the other teams are at a high level.\n\"We need to be very, very demanding.\"\nHeads Saints win - the stats\nSouthampton picked up their first win in all competitions since beating Crystal Palace in September, ending a streak of 14 games without a victory.\nArsenal have lost their first competitive match since August versus Chelsea, ending a run of 22 games without defeat.\nSouthampton are the first team to score three headed goals in a Premier League game since West Brom did so versus Swansea in December 2016.\nArsenal haven't led at half-time in any of their 17 Premier League games so far this season. The Gunners have scored a league-high 27 second half goals in 2018-19.\nSouthampton's Danny Ings scored two headed goals in an English league game for the first time in his career. They were also Southampton's first two headed goals in the competition this season.\nSouthampton's Charlie Austin has scored in all five of his Premier League games against Arsenal - only Raheem Sterling versus Bournemouth (6 games) has a better 100% record of scoring against a specific opponent in Premier League history.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan has scored more Premier League goals for Arsenal in 25 games (six) than he did for Man Utd in 39 appearances (five goals).\nWhat's next\nSaints play Huddersfield away next Saturday at 15:00 GMT while Arsenal have a north London derby against Tottenham on Wednesday in the League Cup quarter-finals.\nThe Gunners take on Burnley in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off in their next Premier League game."

        "article_text": "Brighton 1-2 Chelsea: Eden Hazard stars as Blues hold on for win\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri says there is more to come from Eden Hazard, after the Belgium forward masterminded Chelsea's win against Brighton at the Amex Stadium.\nHazard scored one goal and assisted another as Chelsea, who started without a striker, held on to beat the Seagulls.\nThe 27-year-old set up the Blues' opener with a wonderful pass across the face of goal for the arriving Pedro to tap in on 17 minutes.\nWillian then pounced on a loose pass from Leon Balogun and played in Hazard, who ran from just over the halfway line, outpacing the Brighton defence before slotting past Mat Ryan.\nIt was his eighth league goal of the season, breaking an eight-game scoring drought, and he has nine assists - the most in Europe's top five leagues.\n\"I think that Hazard could have played better because his level is a very high level,\" said Sarri. \"He can do more for him and for us.\n\"But I think after the two injuries, he lost the physical condition. Now he's improving. In one or two matches he'll be back at the top.\"\nBrighton, who welcomed back Glenn Murray to the starting XI after a shoulder injury, barely threatened in the first hour.\nBut they improved following Murray's substitution for Romanian striker Florin Andone and pulled a goal back in the 66th minute.\nBernardo headed a cross back across goal and Solly March was unopposed as he hooked his shot past Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nSeagulls fans felt Marcos Alonso should have been sent off as last man after fouling March late on, but the Spaniard was only shown a yellow card.\nChelsea withstood the hosts' late attacks to record their first win in three away matches and stay in fourth in the Premier League, two points behind Tottenham.\nBrighton remain in 13th place.\nReaction to Chelsea's win and Sunday's other Premier League action\nHazard's heroics\nChelsea only have one fit striker in Olivier Giroud after Alvaro Morata suffered a knee injury in midweek, but they chose to keep the Frenchman on the bench.\nHazard made up for the lack of firepower up front, starting as a false nine flanked by Willian and Pedro, and the Belgium continued his fine form.\nHe has now been involved in more Premier League goals this season (17 in 16 games) than he was in the whole of last season (16 in 34 games).\nHis influence waned in the second half as Brighton grew into the game and his afternoon was ended by a hefty challenge from Dale Stephens, which led to him limping off in the 83rd minute.\nLike Hazard, Chelsea's performance dropped after the break and Brighton finished the stronger of the two teams.\nThey held on though, and Sarri will surely be pleased they did not squander their lead and were able to build on last weekend's impressive 2-0 victory against Manchester City going into the busiest part of the season.\n\"I think that we played a good match,\" said Sarri, who confirmed Hazard's injury was not serious.\n\"We could have won by more goals. We conceded a goal in a moment when we were in full control. The last five minutes against a very physical team were difficult to manage.\"\nBrighton leave themselves 'too much to do'\nBrighton were poor in the first-half and careless in possession.\nTop-scorer Murray, so often the hero for Chris Hughton's side, struggled to gain a footing, failing to register a shot or a touch in the Chelsea box.\nMarch had their sole effort on goal in the first half, a 20-yard effort that was easily collected by Kepa.\nThey started the second half in the same manner and Anthony Knockaert was getting visibly frustrated.\nThe fact Brighton improved after Murray's withdrawal on 60 minutes was telling and the Seagulls movement and intensity increased with the introductions of Andone and Yves Bissouma.\nBrighton pressed hard for an equaliser and Sarri admitted he was \"worried\" about the last five minutes of the game.\nLewis Dunk had their best chance to get a point, but his header in the 92nd minute was just wide.\nHughton admitted they left themselves \"too much to do\", despite a spirited last half hour.\n\"They had two chances in the first half and scored two goals,\" said Hughton. \"We started the game well but you can't give them the leg up by going behind.\n\"Then you have to have a response in the second half which we did in the second-half. If we get the one goal then anything can happen. I can't fault the effort our players put in.\"\nDiscussing Alonso's yellow card for pulling back March, Hughton added: \"Some refs would have give it [a red].\"\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\nStats - Chelsea rack up the goals\nChelsea have scored 37 goals in the Premier League this season, their most at this stage of a campaign since 2014-15 when they won the title (38).\nFive of Brighton's six home defeats in the Premier League have come against the traditional 'big six' teams, including both such defeats this season (1-2 v Spurs and Chelsea).\nChelsea have won each of their seven games against Brighton in league competition, their best 100% record against a single opponent in league history.\nBrighton have kept just three clean sheets in their past 19 games in the Premier League, conceding 31 goals in this run.\nWillian has now been directly involved in 50 goals in the Premier League (27 goals, 23 assists), becoming the third Brazilian player in competition history to reach this milestone, after Philippe Coutinho (76) and Roberto Firmino (64).\nOnly Glenn Murray (eight) has had a hand in more Premier League goals for Brighton than Solly March this season (six - one goal, five assists).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off).\nMeanwhile, Chelsea host Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday (19:45), before Leicester visit Stamford Bridge in the league on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-1 Man Utd: Shaqiri goals put Klopp's men top\nXherdan Shaqiri came off the bench to inspire a Liverpool victory over a lacklustre Manchester United that takes them back to the top of the Premier League.\nLiverpool needed the win after Manchester City beat Everton on Saturday - and it was substitute Shaqiri's rapid-fire double strike in the second half that gave Jurgen Klopp's side the three points they fully deserved.\nSadio Mane's 24th-minute volley from Fabinho's perfect delivery gave Liverpool the lead their lightning start merited, only for a dreadful error by goalkeeper Alisson to give United an unlikely lifeline before the break when he fumbled Romelu Lukaku's cross into the path of Jesse Lingard.\nUnited barely offered an attacking threat but were frustrating Liverpool until Klopp introduced Shaqiri with less than 20 minutes remaining, with devastating effect.\nMeanwhile, Paul Pogba remained an unused substitute on United's bench, Jose Mourinho opting instead to bring on Marouane Fellaini at the interval with his side short of inspiration.\nThere was an element of good fortune about both of the Swiss international's goals, one deflected in from close range and the other off Eric Bailly to beat keeper David de Gea - but one cannot begrudge Liverpool their victory against this desperately ordinary United side.\nHard to see Mourinho at Man Utd next season - Phil McNulty\nCan't win title, can still finish fourth, will definitely be top six - Mourinho on Man Utd\nEnd of Mourinho? Will Pogba leave? The big questions after the Liverpool loss\nLiverpool's perfect week ends in style\nLiverpool and Klopp faced a pivotal week in their season that would shape the immediate future - and they answered the questions posed of them in emphatic fashion.\nThe two tasks in hand were to get the victory they needed over Napoli to reach the last 16 of the Champions League then beat Manchester United to return to the Premier League summit.\nLiverpool showed no hangover from their midweek efforts in successfully achieving that Champions League mission as they set about United with relish and went ahead through Mane - although Alisson's gift to Lingard stopped their momentum and gave Mourinho's side a chance of the point that seemed to be the extent of their ambitions.\nShaqiri's introduction changed all that to leave Klopp's men still unbeaten in the league and United 19 points adrift of their arch-rivals.\nLiverpool are currently in the sort of mood where they believe anything is possible and the signing of Shaqiri has added to their collection of match-winners.\nMohamed Salah was quiet but Shaqiri stepped up in an impressive demonstration of the squad strength at Klopp's disposal.\nMourinho's Manchester United second rate\nManchester United and manager Mourinho may point to the two decisive deflections on Shaqiri's goals - but they would be fooling only themselves if they believe they deserved anything from this game.\nMourinho's gameplan, predictably, was one of physical strength and containment that Liverpool were dealing with dismissively until Alisson's blunder threw them off their stride.\nThe Old Trafford boss added further physical power in the shape of Fellaini at half-time but it was still Liverpool, albeit nowhere near as impressively as in the first period, who were positive and pushing, while United were passive.\nPogba was not even used and Anthony Martial arrived when it was too late - while Klopp brought on the maverick game-changer Shaqiri to make the difference.\nThe contrast was almost symbolic, demonstrating just how quickly United are heading in the opposite direction to this vibrant Liverpool side.\nMan of the match - Fabinho (Liverpool)\n'The strongest team won' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho on BBC Sport: \"The strongest team won, but they won in the period when they were not stronger than us.\n\"In first 20 minutes of the first half there was a huge distance [between the teams]. They were better and stronger, they did everything better than us.\n\"But in the moment when the game was going down, Liverpool's intensity was dying, the centre-backs were shooting from 30-40 metres because they could not find spaces in a dangerous area.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Sky Sports: \"Over the moon about the performance. The way the boys played tonight was outstanding.\n\"We saw the line-up of United and their quality - how organised they were and they fight from the back. The plan was to be brave and chip the ball behind the lines.\n\"The first goal was if you could have drawn it would have been the goal. It's so deserved. Top, top first-class team.\"\nLiverpool's biggest Premier League win over United - the stats\nLiverpool are now 19 points ahead of United - their biggest ever lead over them after the first 17 games of an English top-flight season (based on relevant points for a win rules).\nLiverpool have recorded their biggest Premier League victory over Manchester United at Anfield since also winning 3-1 in March 2011.\nManchester United have now conceded 29 goals in the Premier League this season, one more than they did in the entirety of the 2017-18 campaign and the most goals they've conceded at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1962-63.\nLiverpool recorded 36 shots against Manchester United - the most the Red Devils have faced in a Premier League match since Opta started recording shot data in 2003-04.\nManchester United have picked up 26 points after their first 17 Premier League games, their worst points haul in the top-flight at this stage since 1990-91 (also 26 points).\nXherdan Shaqiri has become just the second Liverpool player to score at least two goals in their first ever match against Manchester United for the Reds, and the first since Nigel Clough did so back in January 1994.\nLiverpool's Alisson has made as many errors leading to goals in the Premier League this season as Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius combined in 2017-18 (2).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Molineux to play Wolves on Friday, 21 December (20:00 GMT), while Manchester United play away at Cardiff the following day (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 0-2 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah helps Reds go four points clear\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp praised his side's \"perfect football\" as Mohamed Salah inspired a victory at Wolves that took them four points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League.\nThe Reds have 48 points from 18 matches - a tally Klopp described as \"outstanding\" - and the only unbeaten league record in English professional football.\nDefending champions City can cut their lead back to a point when they host Crystal Palace on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nIn heavy rain, the Reds went ahead on 18 minutes when Fabinho played a one-two with Sadio Mane and crossed for Salah, who flicked the ball into the net with the outside of his foot.\nThe Egyptian set up Liverpool's second with a wonderful lofted pass over the home defence, allowing Virgil van Dijk to side-foot a six-yard volley past Rui Patricio.\n\"I saw some really good things,\" said Klopp. \"The first goal was brilliant, it was cool, and the second goal - yes, well done.\n\"I'm completely happy with the result and it is big for us. It was brilliant - both goals. It was perfect football, especially on a night when it was difficult to play proper football.\"\nThe victory ensures Klopp's side will be top on Christmas Day - and eight of the past nine teams to have done that have gone on to win the title.\nThe one side that did not was Liverpool in 2013-14 - they finished second, two points behind Manchester City.\nRelive Liverpool's win over Wolves as it happened\nUnbeaten Reds impress again\nLiverpool defender Dejan Lovren said earlier this week that his side could go through an entire league season without losing, replicating the achievement of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' in 2003-04.\nTheir win at Wolves takes them to 18 matches, with 15 wins and three draws. They are one of only three teams - along with Juventus and Paris St-Germain - in the top divisions in England, France, Italy, Spain and Germany to have not lost a league match this season.\nThis was another tough assignment - against a Wolves side that had already beaten Chelsea and taken points off Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal.\nA beautifully crafted move gave the Reds the lead. Salah's quickly taken free-kick led to Fabinho combining with Mane, the Brazil international getting to the byeline and pulling the ball back for Salah to finish with a deft flick past Patricio.\nJames Milner had a chance to add a second but his left-footed strike was well saved.\nSalah, who won last season's Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award, then set up his side's second goal as his clever pass was steered into the net by centre-half Van Dijk for his first Premier League goal for Liverpool.\nKlopp was able to take off both Roberto Firmino and Mane in the second half to rest them for a busy festive programme, which includes matches against Arsenal and Manchester City.\nSubstitute Georginio Wijnaldum nearly added a third in injury time - after Salah forced an error from Willy Boly - and this was a well-deserved victory for the Reds, who are attempting to win a 19th top-flight title but first since 1989-90.\nWolves' winning run ends\nWolves - on course for their best league finish since 1979-80, when they came sixth - entertained their fans before kick-off with a spectacular light and music show to create a fantastic atmosphere at Molineux.\nAnd the home fans were almost celebrating after only four minutes when the recalled Adama Traore shot just off target after Fabinho sloppily gifted away possession.\nTraore also had another strike at goal six minutes later, this time firing past the opposite post, before Salah's breakthrough goal.\nDespite falling behind, the hosts were still causing problems in the first half, and benefiting from Reds players being surprisingly loose with the ball.\nJust before half-time, another Reds error - this time from Naby Keita - gave Matt Doherty a shooting opportunity, but he was denied by Alisson.\nThose misses proved costly as Liverpool cut out the mistakes in the second half, and Van Dijk's volley doubled their advantage.\nEighteen-year-old substitute Morgan Gibbs-White shot into the side-netting late on to deny the home fans a thrilling conclusion to the game as Wolves' three-game winning run came to an end.\nAnalysis\nFormer Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock on BBC Radio 5 live\nLiverpool played well, were well-organised and learned their lessons from the first half and fully deserved to win this game.\nMany people thought it would be a tough game and were wondering if Wolves could upset a top-six side again.\nMohamed Salah is back to his best and this is a great win for Liverpool.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nAnother team Salah has scored against - the stats\nWolves have lost each of their past four Premier League matches against Liverpool.\nSalah has scored more Premier League goals than any other player this season (11), netting four in his past two away games.\nOnly two teams - Chelsea in 2005-06 (49) and Manchester City in 2017-18 (52) - have had more points after 18 Premier League games in a season than Liverpool do (48).\nSalah has scored in each of his past six Premier League appearances against newly promoted opposition, finding the net once in each game.\nWolves have lost four of their past six home league matches - as many as in their previous 34 combined.\nSince the start of last season, Salah has found the net against 20 of the 22 teams he's faced in the Premier League, failing only against Manchester United and Swansea City.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 10 away league games (won eight, drew two) - their best run in the Premier League and longest since also going 10 unbeaten between October 1991 and February 1992.\nKlopp has now defeated all 32 of the British clubs he's faced as Liverpool boss in all competitions - before this match, Wolves were the only side he'd failed to beat, losing in the FA Cup in January 2017 in their only previous meeting.\nLiverpool have won 25 league matches in 2018 - their most in a calendar year since 1990, when they also won 25.\n'The table doesn't mean anything' - what they said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Sport: \"We started the game well, chances for both teams. We didn't maintain the consistency through the game and the start of the second half was not good. Better decisions or composure and we could have harmed a very good team.\n\"The boys worked very hard and it's difficult to play against Liverpool, especially when they're in front. We deserved one goal at least. We have to now rest.\n\"I'm happy because of the way we work and pass the moments football gives. We are consistent - the table doesn't mean anything.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was clear the whole game would be difficult. Everybody wants to press. We want to be compact but wide as well which makes it difficult.\n\"We defended it pretty well. The heavy rain was difficult for both teams. It was a big fight and we knew we needed to be ready.\n\"We will be training on Christmas morning so it is like every other day and we have Manchester City waiting so that will be really tough for the boys. We need to have different game plans but the boys showed they are ready for that.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host Newcastle on Wednesday, 26 December (15:00 GMT), before matches at home against Arsenal (29 December) and at Manchester City (3 January).\nWolves' next three games are all against London sides.

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-1 Burnley: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang double sees Arsenal keep pressure on top four\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche criticised the officials after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's double ensured Arsenal maintained pressure on the top four and left the Clarets in the Premier League bottom three at Christmas.\nAshley Barnes responded for the visitors in a fiery contest that featured seven yellow cards, but Alex Iwobi's late goal sealed victory for the Gunners.\nDyche, whose side have now gone 61 Premier League games without a penalty, reeled off a list of decisions he felt went against his side.\n\"So many went against us. Ashley Barnes got an elbow in the face from an unnatural movement yet he comes out with a booking. Two dives again, but nobody got booked,\" he said.\n\"The biggest one for me, I think it's 60 games now without a penalty, there was a two-handed push on Kevin Long but the penalty wasn't given because he goes down naturally.\n\"Apart from that I was quite happy with the referee's performance.\"\nMesut Ozil - making a first start in six league matches - produced a sublime defence-splitting pass to Sead Kolasinac for Arsenal's opener, with the defender picking out Aubameyang for his 11th league goal of the season.\nRemarkably, after 18 top-flight games, Arsenal led at the interval for the first time this season. It took them less than three second-half minutes to double the advantage, Aubameyang's powerful finish completing a quick counter-attack.\nBurnley struck to their task, though, and Barnes brought them back into the contest on 63 minutes with a low finish after the home side failed to clear.\nThe home fans grew increasingly nervous as Burnley pushed for an equaliser but Iwobi scored from close range in stoppage time to ensure the Gunners moved level with fourth-placed Chelsea, who lost at home to Leicester.\nLive Premier League coverage\nArsenal v Burnley as it happened\nReturning Ozil inspires Arsenal\nAfter their impressive 22-game unbeaten run was ended by a revitalised Southampton last weekend, Arsenal exited the Carabao Cup to north London rivals Tottenham in midweek and needed to produce a response at Emirates Stadium - if only to keep in touch with the top four.\nUnai Emery's side started accordingly. The Arsenal manager said this week that Ozil does have a future at the club, and the opening goal was all about the midfielder's genius.\nThe German demonstrated his value with a ball from the edge of the area that curled behind the Burnley defence, finding Kolasinac at the back post. His first-time flick found Aubameyang, who placed his shot into the bottom corner.\nArsenal's success so far this campaign has relied on strong second-half showings, and the tireless Kolasinac led an explosive counter-attack on 47 minutes which resulted in Aubameyang firing his second into the roof of Joe Hart's goal.\nAnd Ozil was at the heart of Arsenal's third, drifting into the penalty area and committing a couple of defenders before his scuffed shot found its way to Iwobi. Replays suggested the substitute was marginally offside but the officials allowed the goal to stand.\nIt provided welcome relief for the Gunners after Burnley had threatened to snatch a point.\n\"It was a big performance and afterwards I spoke with him and said 'congratulations for your work',\" Emery said of Ozil. \"He showed his quality and we needed him to work to help us today and he did.\"\nThe Gunners have been forced to field a makeshift defence in recent games - leading Emery to admit he may use the January transfer window to strengthen his options - and there were often hints of that fragility before Barnes eventually took advantage of some half-hearted attempts to clear.\nThe hosts continued to struggle after the Clarets turned the contest into a bruising battle.\n\"It was a tough match. I think we won not because we played well but because every player had a very big commitment,\" added Emery.\n\"I think we can controlled the match like we wanted. We had to make an alteration to our gameplan but it gave us the victory.\"\nBattling Burnley left empty-handed\nThe Clarets, despite their league position, have made steady progress in recent weeks towards getting back to the resilient displays that brought them success last season, and arrived at Arsenal knowing a point would be enough to rise out of the bottom three.\nThere was frequent evidence of the grit Dyche's side are capable of - and must continue to show - although Barnes was perhaps a little exuberant and lucky to stay on the pitch.\nHe was shown a yellow card after tangling with Sokratis Papastathopoulos, before escaping further punishment after an incident involving Matteo Guendouzi, where he appeared to try and kick the ball out of the Frenchman's grasp after a foul.\nDespite being 2-0 down, they continued their disruptive approach and were rewarded when Barnes fired in at the back post.\nLong had a strong shout for a penalty turned down - after he was shoved in the back - while Barnes looked certain to level from six yards out before referee Kevin Friend halted play for a foul.\nJack Cork sent a curling shot just wide from a tight angle but Iwobi's late strike ensured Burnley remain 18th with their worst top-flight return after 18 games since 1970-71.\n\"It wasn't a 3-1 game, I think all would agree with that. But the scoreline is the scoreline,\" said Dyche.\n\"We wanted to see if we could chase the game, physicality has to be part of the game - English fans certainly enjoy that part of the game but you have to do that in a a fair way. I think you'll find we're a fair outfit.\"\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\nArsenal finally lead at half-time - the stats\nArsenal found themselves ahead in a Premier League game at half-time for the first time this campaign, last doing so against Huddersfield on the final day of last season.\nCourtesy of their 12 points, this is Burnley's worst top-flight campaign after 18 games since they accrued 10 at this stage in 1970/71 (with three points for a win) and were ultimately relegated.\nArsenal have won their past 28 home league games against sides starting the day in the relegation zone since a 4-4 draw with Tottenham in October 2008.\nDyche has lost all seven of his Premier League meetings with Arsenal, more defeats in the competition than he has suffered against any other side.\nAubameyang has been directly involved in 19 goals in his 17 Premier League home games (14 goals, 5 assists).

        "article_text": "Newcastle 0-0 Fulham: Benitez unhappy with decisions\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez said he was \"not happy with some situations and decisions\" from his side during their draw with bottom side Fulham at St James' Park.\nThe hosts built momentum in the second half and were denied a penalty despite appeals for a shirt tug on Kenedy by Fulham's Joe Bryan.\nFulham forward Aleksandar Mitrovic then had a shot blocked by Jamaal Lascelles with minutes to go - prompting another penalty appeal for handball - before Aboubakar Kamara's darting run threatened to win it for the visitors.\n\"The worst thing is that, in a game we could win, where we were pushing and had control, we could have lost it in the last counter-attack,\" said Benitez. \"It's good that we didn't lose but the negative is that we gave Fulham those situations to score and were a bit lucky in the end.\n\"You have to find the balance if you want to win. Sometimes you're attacking but make a wrong decision and leave yourself exposed.\"\nNewcastle's best chance arrived in the first half when Lascelles' header bounced dangerously across the face of goal after taking a deflection off Mitrovic.\nFabian Schar also went close with a header in the second half which flew inches over the crossbar.\nFulham remain four points from safety but kept their first clean sheet in 22 Premier League games - since winning 1-0 against Norwich in April 2014.\nOf the 92 teams in professional English football, Fulham were the only team not to have kept a clean sheet prior to this draw.\nManager Claudio Ranieri said his players \"responded well\" to a new system and if they continued to fight \"sooner or later we'll change the way\".\n\"It's the first time I've tried to play with three centre-backs and the players responded well,\" said Ranieri. \"They were very solid against a physical team.\n\"I'm happy because every point we achieve is good.\"\nRelive Newcastle's draw with Fulham\nNewcastle appeals fall on deaf ears\nNewcastle will sit in 15th place on Christmas Day before embarking on a tough run of fixtures that will see them take on Liverpool and Chelsea away, as well as welcoming Manchester City and Manchester United to St James' Park.\nThey would have seen this game as an opportunity to pick up all three points and record back-to-back victories for the first time in the league since the end of November.\nBut it was a contest of very few clear-cut chances - Newcastle failed to record a single shot on target despite earning six corners.\nThere were a few soft appeals for a penalty in the first half when Tim Ream brought down Salomon Rondon, and again when Matt Ritchie's shot hit the hand of Calum Chambers, who was unable to move it out of the way.\nAnd when Kenedy appeared to be dragged back by Bryan, frustrations grew around the ground.\nImprovement at the back for Fulham\nIt took 22 Premier League matches, but Fulham eventually recorded a clean sheet - and it was one they had to fight for.\nBut despite the hosts' increased pressure, Fulham were rarely troubled and had two great chances at the end to win the game.\nMitrovic's shot which hit Lascelles was worth appealing for and moments later Kamara's driving run threatened to split open a defence which had been caught on the counter-attack.\nLascelles recovered in time for Newcastle to deny Kamara a last-ditch effort on goal but Fulham's confidence will have been bolstered by their defensive display against an organised team.\n'Very important for us' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"Sometimes it can be tense at home, when they say you have to win the game, but Fulham spent a lot of money in the summer. They are bottom but have a good team. They are organised, they had five at the back and were dangerous on the counter-attack.\n\"It's good that we didn't lose but the negative is that we gave Fulham those situations to score and were a bit lucky in the end.\"\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It is very important for us. First half maybe we created more play and had possession well, but they had a very big chance.\n\"Second half we lost control and they were dangerous, but we had four or five chances on the counter-attack, so at the end I'm happy because every point we achieve is good.\"\nThe best of the stats\nBenitez has yet to lose a home Premier League game against Fulham (W4 D4), with his teams keeping a clean sheet in each of the past six meetings.\nFulham kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League in 22 games, since winning 1-0 against Norwich in April 2014.\nFulham won just their second away point in their past 12 outings in the Premier League (D2 L10).\nNewcastle have won just three of their past 17 Premier League games against promoted sides (D5 L9).\nNewcastle have won just two of their past 10 Premier League games at St James' Park (D1 L7).\nFulham have failed to find the back of the net in six of their past nine Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle travel to league leaders Liverpool on Wednesday 26 December (15:00 GMT), while Fulham welcome Wolves to Craven Cottage (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-0 Brighton: Howe 'pleasantly surprised' by match-winner Brooks\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said he has been \"pleasantly surprised\" by David Brooks, after the Cherries' summer signing netted both goals in a 2-0 victory over 10-man Brighton.\nBrooks collected the ball on the edge of the area, turned onto his left foot and cracked a low shot past Mat Ryan to open the scoring midway through the first half.\nThe 21-year-old Welshman then flicked Ryan Fraser's teasing cross over the Brighton goalkeeper with 13 minutes remaining to seal three points for the hosts.\n\"He showed his quality in both moments,\" Howe said of the former Sheffield United man.\n\"We knew that we were getting a very technical and intelligent player, but he really buys into the team ethic and has a tactical understanding of how the team plays, and an ability to handle the Premier League and not get carried away with his early season success.\"\nHowe added Bournemouth may have been fortunate to secure the services of the Wales international in July.\n\"He had glandular fever at the end of last season and that was probably the reason we were able to sign him, as if he'd stayed fit and kept playing he might have gone beyond us [to a bigger club],\" he said.\nAsmir Begovic had been the busier of the two goalkeepers in the opening 20 minutes at the Vitality Stadium, denying Yves Bissouma from point-blank range before getting down low to palm Jurgen Locadia's effort to safety.\nThe Seagulls were reduced to 10 men after 73 minutes when Lewis Dunk's tackle on Callum Wilson earned the defender a second yellow card.\nThe win lifts Bournemouth up three places to eighth, while Brighton remain in 13th.\nNo way past Begovic\nHaving seen their team lose six of their previous seven league matches, the majority of Bournemouth fans will have viewed Saturday's game as a must-win encounter.\nAnd the Cherries had Begovic to thank for keeping the score at 0-0 in the early stages of the first half as Brighton took the game to their hosts.\nThe former Stoke and Chelsea goalkeeper pulled off fine saves to deny Bissouma and Locadia, before getting down low to his left to prevent Dunk from cancelling out Brooks' fine opener on the stroke of half-time.\nBegovic also did well to smother Florin Andone's goalbound header not long after the restart - although the linesman's flag was already up for offside.\nBrighton continued to push for an equaliser as the second half wore on, but Dunk's red card - 12 minutes after his first booking - all but ended their hopes of a first away win over Bournemouth since 2007.\nBrooks' second goal - a fine header from Fraser's cross - capped a fine performance from the 21-year-old, who has now scored five goals in his first 15 Premier League appearances for Howe's team.\nLady Luck not on Brighton's side\nBrighton managed just one attempt on target in their last away game - a 1-0 reverse at lowly Burnley - and that only came deep into added time at the end of the second half.\nManager Chris Hughton left Glenn Murray and Anthony Knockaert on the bench at the Vitality Stadium, but their replacements - Locadia and Andone - caused the home defence numerous problems in the first half.\nLocadia in particular was unfortunate not to get his name on the scoresheet, his low effort from the edge of the penalty area tipped around the post by Begovic.\nHughton will have been pleased with his team's display until Dunk's sending-off, with replays suggesting the 27-year-old may have been unfortunate to be given his marching orders.\nReferee Mike Dean showed the Brighton defender his first yellow card for a challenge on Brooks, but the Bournemouth match-winner appeared to be caught by the retreating Bissouma.\nThe visitors remain comfortably above the relegation places despite the defeat, but their lack of firepower away from home - only Fulham and Cardiff have scored fewer goals on the road this season - is becoming a major cause for concern.\nMan of the match - David Brooks (Bournemouth)\nAnother assist for Fraser - the stats\nBournemouth registered a clean sheet in the Premier League for the first time in eight games, since a 3-0 win against Fulham in October.\nBrighton have lost three consecutive Premier League games within a single season for the first time since December 2017.\nBournemouth have seen their opponents pick up five red cards this season in the Premier League, more than any other side.\nHughton has never beaten Bournemouth in his managerial career, losing four and drawing once (all while in charge of Brighton).\nBrooks has netted five goals in his past 11 league appearances, after managing just three in his previous 35.\nJoshua King has been directly involved in 44 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (35 goals, 9 assists), 10 more than any other player (Callum Wilson on 34).\nBournemouth's Jefferson Lerma picked up a divisional-high eighth booking of the season in the Premier League, with only Harry Arter in 2016-17 accruing more in a single campaign in the competition for the Cherries (11).\nOnly Eden Hazard (9) has registered more assists in the Premier League this season than Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser (8).\nWin 'sets us up for Christmas' - what the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We were a lot better in the second half, even before the [second] goal and the sending-off we had control of the game. We were indebted to our goalkeeper in the first half so we were pleased to come through.\n\"The recent run we've been on has been tough. At 1-0 the game's still in the balance but we stood firm. Hopefully that sets us up nicely for the Christmas period as we've got two matches now [against Tottenham and Manchester United] where we can really attack.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton:\n\"No doubts about [Dunk's] second yellow, but for the first we felt it was Yves Bissouma who makes the first contact, so that was harsh on Lewis.\n\"I was really pleased with our performance, particularly in the first half. It was tough to come in at 1-0 down but it's about making sure you take your chances.\n\"We were up against a talented team playing at home. But overall, apart from that last period [after the second goal and the red card] which was very difficult for us, we were always in the game.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Tottenham Hotspur on 26 December (15:00 GMT), while Brighton welcome Arsenal to the Amex Stadium (17:15)."

At 18 years and 169 days old, the Republic of Ireland international became Southampton's youngest scorer in the Premier League, and also forced Lossl into a save late in the match.\nBad day at the office for Huddersfield\nThe errors by Kongolo and Schindler that led to Southampton's first and third goals summed up a one step forward, two steps back approach for the Terriers, with each undermining periods where they could have taken hold of the match.\nJorgensen's trip on Ings for the penalty just before half-time only added to the problems faced by Huddersfield manager David Wagner.\nMaybe the German roused his side in the dressing room, because they looked a different proposition until Obafemi's killer blow, but the stark facts now are Huddersfield have huge problems as the season nears the halfway point.\nThat Billing's goal was just the fourth scored by the home side at the John Smith's Stadium this season is worrying enough, but the absence of Mooy until February is another headache for Wagner.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond (Southampton)\nHasenhuttl nearly catching Hughes already - the stats you may have missed\nHasenhuttl has won two of his three Premier League matches in charge of Southampton (L1) - only one fewer than Mark Hughes managed in 22 attempts as Saints boss.\nSouthampton have registered back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since April 2017 under Claude Puel.\nHuddersfield have lost nine of their past 12 home Premier League games (W1 D2), netting just four goals in that time.\nRedmond scored his first Premier League goal of the season for Southampton with his 28th shot at goal.\nSince the start of last season, Huddersfield Town have had more different players booked for diving than any other Premier League team (4 - Rajiv van La Parra, Alex Pritchard, Laurent Depoitre and Chris Lowe).\nDuring 2018, Huddersfield have played 20 matches in all competitions at the John Smith's Stadium, scoring just 11 times (W3 D4 L13).\nIngs has scored five league goals (including play-offs) against Huddersfield - more than against any other side.\nObafemi became both the youngest player to score in the Premier League for Southampton and also the youngest player from the Republic of Ireland to score in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nThe Terriers travel to Old Trafford on 26 December to face Manchester United (15:00 GMT). Southampton get an extra day off, and face West Ham at home on Thursday (19:45 GMT)."

The keeper always has a good performance and he gives confidence to the rest of the team.\"\nWoodwork and wastefulness for West Ham\nUnlike West Ham's clinical victory at Fulham last weekend, this was a more frustrating match in front of goal.\nDespite having 18 shots on goal, Manuel Pellegrini's side toiled in attack and when they did forge a clear opening they were guilty of wayward finishing.\n\"I think we were a bit unlucky to not at least draw,\" said Pellegrini.\n\"The penalty was the only action in our box in the first half, and we had three or four chances to draw the game.\"\nThe best of those opportunities fell to Antonio, who headed against the post at the start of the second half, then spurned a gilt-edged chance to level the scores late on.\nReacting first to Foster's save from Snodgrass, Antonio - with six goals in his past eight games against Watford - somehow managed to head against the crossbar from no more than four yards out.\nThere were other missed opportunities too, with Hernandez uncharacteristically snatching at a shot from Felipe Anderson's cut-back.\nAt the other end, Lukasz Fabianski heroically saved point-blank efforts from Abdoulaye Doucoure and Deeney, as the second half drew on but those missed chances did not cost the visitors.\nMan of the match - Ben Foster (Watford)\nDeeney excels at London Stadium - the stats\nWatford have won five of their past eight Premier League games against West Ham (D1 L2), winning three away from home in this run (1-0 in Feb 2007, 4-2 in Sept 2016 and 2-0 in Dec 2018).\nWest Ham lost just their second game in their past nine in the Premier League, having won each of the last four before today.\nWest Ham have failed to keep a clean sheet in 10 of their past 11 Premier League home games.\nDeeney has scored in three of his past four league appearances against West Ham, with two of those goals coming at London Stadium.\nDeulofeu scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career.\nWatford ended a run of seven consecutive Premier League games in which they failed to keep a clean sheet.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham face trips to Southampton on Thursday 27 December (19:45 GMT) and Burnley on 30 December (14:15) before returning to the London Stadium on 2 January (19:45) to take on Brighton in front of an increased capacity of 60,000.\nWatford host Chelsea on 26 December (19:30) and Newcastle on 29 December (15:00) before travelling to Bournemouth on 2 January (19:45)."

We reacted a little shocked and with mental confusion. We had to only keep playing like we did before the goal, there was time to recover.\"\nThe Blues had not lost at home since 1 April, against Tottenham, and this defeat leaves them level on points with fifth-placed Arsenal, who beat Burnley 3-1 earlier on Saturday. They trail leaders Liverpool by 11 points.\nFor Leicester, the win moves them up to ninth in the table and is their first victory from 11 matches in London.\nRelive Chelsea v Leicester\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nCrisis? What crisis?\nReports\n, external\nbefore the game spoke not just of pressure on Leicester boss Claude Puel from the club's owners but of an apparent falling-out with his players, too.\nThere was little sign of the team lacking any motivation or desire on the pitch on Saturday.\nResisting the intensity of Chelsea's attacking intent is by no means a small feat. Puel's men not only managed to achieve that, but also to build on it as they forced themselves slowly but surely into the game.\nIt was Vardy's goal, scored on his 250th appearance for the club, that sealed victory, but it was a win earned by the whole team through constant running, daring in defence, and precision when it counted.\nWith Manchester City up next on 26 December, it had been suggested Leicester's following match at home to Cardiff on 29 December might even decide the future of their French manager.\nInstead, this impressive victory, a first at Stamford Bridge since 2000, must surely stand as evidence of Puel's worth.\nChelsea however, will now face questions of their own.\nBad misses or bad luck?\nThis was not a vintage Chelsea performance - not the kind of showing we have come to expect from them at home since Sarri's arrival in the summer.\nLooking back on the match, the Italian will identify three big misses that cost his side.\nThere was Hazard, smashing against the bar in search of his 100th Chelsea goal, there was Rudiger's header wide under pressure but with the goal gaping at a corner, and finally Alonso's 91st-minute miss when clean through.\nThe Spaniard, played in behind the Leicester defence, side-footed his shot against the post and out, having been given what seemed an age to pick his spot.\nPerhaps these were moments of bad luck. Sarri is renowned as being a very superstitious man, but he will not have failed to observe the clear dip in intensity from his side after going behind, which ultimately defined their afternoon.\nThey seemed shell-shocked after Vardy's powerful strike, and only managed to conjure something of their finer play in the final few dramatic minutes. It turned out to be too little, too late.\nHazard left the field with a wry smile having missed out on the chance of becoming just the 10th Chelsea player to reach that landmark total of a century of goals.\nHad he done so, the afternoon might have ended very differently for Puel, the man who gave him his senior debut 11 years ago for French club Lille.\nMan of the match - Ricardo Pereira (Leicester)\nWhat's next?\nChelsea next play at Watford in the Premier League on Wednesday, 26 December, before travelling to Crystal Palace on Sunday, 30 December.\nLeicester host Manchester City on Wednesday, before Cardiff travel to King Power Stadium on Saturday, 29 December.\nWhat the managers said\nLeicester manager Claude Puel, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It was fantastic hard work from the team together, first to defend and after to try and counter-attack.\n\"In the second half with the confidence, we performed, scored a fantastic goal, a fantastic reward for the team because we gave our best.\n\"It is a fantastic feeling. Hopefully we continue this way but the win doesn't change anything. It is important we go away to analyse our game; that we continue to work with the same mentality and same attitude.\"\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"As I said at the beginning of the Premier League, it is impossible to catch Liverpool and Manchester City. We have to be careful to stay close to the first four positions.\"\nVardy a big six menace - the stats\nChelsea have failed to score in two of their past four home league games, as many as in their previous 21, and lost at home in the league for the first time in 13 games\nVardy has scored 13 goals in his past 15 Premier League appearances against the 'big six' sides\nChelsea conceded a home Premier League goal for the first time in four games, ending a run of 357 minutes without an opposition goal at Stamford Bridge\nLeicester's James Maddison has created 41 goalscoring chances in the Premier League this season, more than any other English player"

Strike - everyone loves Townsend's goal\nA strike that sent shockwaves through the stadium\nAs City boss Pep Guardiola would bemoan after the game, two Palace shots led to two goals in the first half, but it was definitely a case of quality over quantity for the visitors.\nThe City fans were still on their feet singing \"stand up for the champions\" until just before Jeffrey Schlupp equalised from the edge of the box, and that setback was still sinking in when Townsend's sensational volley sent shockwaves through the stadium soon afterwards.\nTownsend put it perfectly when he described it as \"definitely the best goal of my career, against the best side I've ever played\" because it was a strike that seemed to knock City out of their stride.\nIt affected the home side's players as well as their fans - with City unable to up their tempo or quality in the final third in the remainder of the first half - with the effect repeated when Luka Milivojevic extended Palace's lead from the penalty spot just after the break.\nYou can almost understand why. Seeing City behind at home is something their fans are simply not used to under Guardiola, who before Saturday had lost just two out of 48 league games here since taking charge in summer 2016.\nIt is not something this current side have experienced often on home turf either. As Guardiola explained afterwards, they are used to waiting to break down stubborn opposition before going on to win fairly comfortably - most of the time.\n\"This was a typical game we have played many times,\" he said. \"Where everyone defends deep, we break the game up when we score a goal and afterwards, with patience, we score a second goal and they have to open up a little bit and we have spaces to kill the game.\"\nThat did not happen against Palace - less than eight minutes after Ilkay Gundogan gave them the lead, City were behind - never to recover.\n'We did not come here thinking we had no chance'\nRoy Hodgson's beaming smile after the game said it all - his Palace side had delivered their best performance of the season, on what was - on paper - their toughest assignment.\nGuardiola, though, was right when he pointed out afterwards that City were not out-played by Palace - just undone by classic counter-attacking football.\n\"The first time they passed halfway - it was wow, a goal,\" Guardiola said. \"Second time too. I want to give credit to Palace and I don't underestimate what they have done, but that is football sometimes.\"\nIt is obviously not the end of City's title hopes either. While this defeat means they will trail Liverpool by four points on Christmas Day - compared to the same time last year when they were 13 points clear at the top - it would clearly be foolish to write them off, especially before the halfway stage of the season.\nGuardiola clearly does not intend to surrender the title easily, saying: \"It is complicated, but we will fight until the last second. We are in December and we will try to recover and win games again.\"\nHe is right - there are still five months of the campaign remaining - but while this home defeat was damaging, if City lose their next game at the Etihad then it will be a lot more decisive.\nLiverpool are the next team in town on 3 January, so this was not a good time to show that fortress Etihad has any weak points. If Palace can exploit them, Jurgen Klopp's side will be confident of doing likewise."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 1-5 Manchester United: Reds rampant in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first game\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer got off to a perfect start as Manchester United's interim manager with a 5-1 thrashing of his former club Cardiff.\nThe former United striker succeeded Jose Mourinho, who was sacked in midweek, and got his first win courtesy of a performance that will encourage United fans as some of their more marginalised talent came to the fore in a performance full of attacking intent.\nMarcus Rashford's stunning free-kick, a deflected effort from Ander Herrera and a fabulous team goal by Anthony Martial effectively won the contest before half-time for a United side inspired by the recalled Paul Pogba, who had a hand in all three first-half goals.\nVictor Camarasa's penalty briefly gave Cardiff hope as they reduced the arrears to 2-1, but Jesse Lingard won and scored a contentious second-half penalty and then rounded Neil Etheridge to tap into an empty net at the death to make the result safe.\nIt is the first time United have scored five goals in a Premier League game since legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson's last game in charge - a 5-5 draw with West Brom in May 2013.\nRelive United's win over Cardiff\nWatch: 'Solskjaer can't fail'\nA more attacking United than under Mourinho?\nAll eyes were on Solskjaer's first selection as United boss, and Pogba was included in the starting line-up.\nThe World Cup winner and club record signing had been a forlorn-looking substitute for the past three Premier League matches, but returned to a more attack-minded United XI.\nPogba was joined by French forward Martial, who made his 100th Premier League appearance, with Romelu Lukaku away on compassionate leave.\nLuke Shaw and Phil Jones returned to a defence that had conceded 29 goals already this term - their worst record since 1962 - as Solskjaer made four changes.\nPogba was involved in the thick of the action inside three minutes, winning a free-kick from Aron Gunnarsson that would give the Norwegian the perfect start to life in the United dugout, Rashford brilliantly finding the bottom corner.\nSolskjaer was punching the air in delight with less than four minutes on the clock.\nThe contest proved an ideal opportunity for Pogba to send a message on the pitch rather than on social media and he certainly appeared less inhibited as the visitors passed with a good tempo and closed down effectively.\nUnited were superior throughout the first period and it was no surprise when they doubled their advantage just before the half-hour mark when Pogba picked out Herrera, whose speculative effort nicked off Greg Cunningham and gave Neil Etheridge no chance.\nHowever, United's defensive fragility reappeared before the interval, with Rashford handballing carelessly when he moved his upper arm towards the ball under little pressure and Camarasa slammed home the penalty.\nBut in the end, United made light work of a Cardiff side, who had won their past four home games, with attacking flair throughout.\nSolskjaer's return intrigues both sets of supporters\nThere was a keen sense of intrigue among both sets of supporters about the presence of Solskjaer in the United dugout.\nHis appointment as Mourinho's temporary successor caused raised eyebrows in South Wales after his disappointing spell managing the Bluebirds in 2014, which included a relegation from the Premier League.\nSolskjaer, 45, is contracted to return to his role as manager at Norwegian club Molde next summer, but Cardiff supporters remember him for a disastrous nine-month spell in charge in the Welsh capital.\nSolskjaer scored 126 goals in 366 appearances during his 11 years at Old Trafford and is best remembered for scoring the winner in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 1999, along with collecting six Premier League titles.\nThe sense of goodwill from United's travelling supporters towards the man they called the 'Baby-Faced Assassin' was obvious - they chanted about their temporary boss from well before kick-off and gave him a rapturous reception when the sides emerged at Cardiff City Stadium.\nBefore the game, Cardiff boss Neil Warnock had said Solskjaer \"could not lose\" in his new position. The former striker was keen to get his messages across, moving to the edge of his technical area several times to deliver advice and encourage his team to find more width.\nHe would have felt slightly unsettled when Cardiff reduced the arrears to 2-1, but a fine team move a minute later saw Martial exchange passes with Pogba and Lingard and fire past Etheridge to give United deserved daylight at the interval.\nCardiff's fine run at home comes to an end\nThe Bluebirds had won four of their past five Premier League home games, yet the omens were not good for a side chasing a first victory over United in 58 years.\nWarnock has failed to beat United in any of his previous seven encounters and, with a two-goal deficit at half-time, that never looked like changing.\nUnited dominated at the start of the second half and Lingard's penalty killed the contest, with United close to adding further goals through Rashford, Phil Jones and Pogba, before Lingard did add the fifth after keeping his composure when clean through to round Etheridge and slot home.\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba\n'Football is easy with good players' - What they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"Football is easy if you've got good players! They are a great bunch of players and their quality is unbelievable.\n\"I arrived on Wednesday night and only had Thursday and Friday with the players. Wayne Rooney texted me and gave me some advice - so it must be down to him! He told me to make them play football, enjoy themselves and be Manchester United.\n\"The foundation was in the defending. I thought the two centre-backs and two full-backs were brilliant.\"\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock: \"If you'd told me at the start of this season that we'd be out of the bottom three at Christmas I'd have snapped your hand off.\n\"We've got two big games coming up [at Crystal Palace and Leicester]. We know we need to improve our away form. I wasn't disappointed in the effort, it was just misdirected at times.\n\"At half-time I still thought we had a chance. I thought if we get the next goal we might get something. It's very disappointing.\"\nScoring big on the first day - the best of the stats\nSince Ferguson left the club, four of the five different managers to take charge of United have seen their side score three or more goals in their first Premier League game (Moyes 4, Mourinho 3, Giggs 4 and Solskjaer 5).\nWarnock suffered his 50th Premier League defeat, in what was his 92nd game in the competition - only Mick McCarthy (79), Danny Wilson (87) and Gary Megson (91) have reached 50 defeats in fewer games managed.\nCardiff have lost each of their past 14 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents, conceding 45 goals in this run.\nMartial has been directly involved in 70 goals for United in all competitions (45 goals, 25 assists); the most of any player for the club since his debut in September 2015.\nRashford has had a hand in more Premier League goals this season than any other United player (9 - four goals and five assists).\nUnited's third goal against Cardiff - scored by Anthony Martial - was the 500th netted in the Premier League this season.\nMartial made his 100th appearance for United in the Premier League, becoming just the fourth Frenchman to reach this tally for the club after Eric Cantona, Mikael Silvestre and Patrice Evra.\nWhat's next?\nCardiff travel to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, December 26 (15:00 GMT), while Manchester United take on Huddersfield at Old Trafford (15:00)."

It would have been 2-0, it [the alleged foul] doesn't look anything special. I don't know if it would have been the same in the other box.\n\"A second goal for us would be different for sure. In that moment the referee saw something I did not see. I can't see anything there.\n\"The first goal we conceded is impossible. It [defensive error] happened with our team in the last game.\n\"We have to realise why it happens so many times with us.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino on why 6-2 is a special scoreline: \"It's my present for my wife.\n\"We got married 26 years ago. And a fantastic way to celebrate tonight.\"\nOn Deli Alli's injury: \"He didn't feel a big problem. Maybe a little bit tired from Wednesday. I hope it's not a big issue. It was a precaution.\"\nNo travel sickness from Spurs - the stats\nTottenham have won nine of their 11 Premier League away games this season.\nThis is the third time Everton conceded six goals in a Premier League home game, with all of those coming against London clubs (1-6 v Arsenal in August 2009, 3-6 v Chelsea in August 2014).\nThis is the fourth time Tottenham have scored six or more goals in a Premier League away game, with three of those coming in the last three seasons, and twice against a side managed by Marco Silva.\nUnder Mauricio Pochettino, Spurs have won more games (18) and more points (70) from losing positions than any other side in the Premier League.\nHarry Kane has scored at least twice in each of his last four Premier League appearances against Everton.\nNo player has made more errors leading to a goal in the Premier League this season than Everton's Jordan Pickford (3).\nTottenham have never lost in the 36 Premier League games in which Dele Alli has scored for them.\n2018-19 is the first top-flight season to see at least three clubs amass 40+ points by Christmas (Liverpool 48, Man City 44, Spurs 42) since the 1985-86 campaign.\nWhat's next?\nEverton are on the road over Christmas with matches at Burnley (15:00 GMT) on Boxing Day and Brighton (15:00) on 29 December.

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-1 Wolves: Alexsandar Mitrovic 'wants to cry' after missing chances in draw\nFulham captain Aleksandar Mitrovic said he felt like crying after missing several chances in his side's scrappy draw with Wolves that lifted the Cottagers off the bottom of the table.\nThe hosts were on top in the first half at Craven Cottage but Mitrovic could not convert any of his seven attempts, while Raul Jimenez went close for the visitors with an acrobatic bicycle kick.\nWolves were more assured after the break without regularly threatening before Fulham substitute Ryan Sessegnon scuffed in a volley after Rui Patricio's weak punch on 74 minutes.\nBut the hosts could not hold on for a third Premier League win of the season as Ivan Cavaleiro got in down the left to slide the ball across goal, with Fulham wing-back Joe Bryan stopping the ball but then falling over - allowing Romain Saiss to tap in his first Premier League goal.\nMitrovic then got in behind from a long, clearing kick by Fulham keeper Sergio Rico on 90 minutes but his deflected, clipped effort was cleared off the line by Conor Coady.\n\"If I shot 100 more times the ball wouldn't go in,\" Mitrovic told Sky Sports. \"I played a good game but didn't score and that's the most important thing for a striker.\n\"I'm very disappointed, angry and want to cry - but that's football. You have these days and you just need to keep going.\"\nWednesday's draw takes Fulham to 19th, four points from safety after Cardiff's draw with Crystal Palace, while Huddersfield drop to 20th after a 3-1 defeat by Manchester United.\nThe wasteful eight\nMitrovic failed to convert any of his eight chances against Wolves and has now not scored in his past six league appearances, having also had another six-game goalless streak earlier in the season.\nThe Serbia international became the first player in the Premier League this season to have seven attempts in the first half, but he only got two on target, both of which were too close to Patricio.\nIt took 25 minutes for the first effort on target by either side in a lifeless start, Mitrovic failing to get enough power on a header at the back post off Cyrus Christie's cross.\nHe then picked up a loose ball in the Wolves area, before turning his man and shifting it past another - but his low effort was blocked by Patricio's legs.\nMitrovic was kept quieter in the second half before missing the most crucial opening of the game - he did well to force his way on to Rico's clearance but then could not lift his effort over Ryan Bennett's outstretched leg, with Coady alert to scramble the ball away.\nWhile he causes defences plenty of problems, Mitrovic's scoring rate of seven goals in the first half of the season is not likely to be enough to keep up a Fulham side that has conceded 43 times.\nImproved Fulham still falter\nFulham have now taken six points from seven matches under Claudio Ranieri, one more than they managed in 12 games under predecessor Slavisa Jokanovic this season.\nWhile perhaps not a seismic improvement, the Italian has made the Cottagers more organised, their defence keeping Wolves to largely speculative efforts for long periods.\nThe return of Sessegnon after two games out with a groin injury is also particularly welcome. His goal was a touch fortunate, deflecting off a Wolves defender and the underside of the crossbar on the way in - but he gave his side renewed vigour after replacing Andre Schurrle on 67 minutes when Wolves were on top.\nHowever, Fulham are still prone to lapses of concentration and Joao Moutinho was given far too much time and space on the ball to turn and slide in an unmarked Cavaleiro before Bryan's error on the line.\nWith key matches against fellow relegation candidates Huddersfield and Burnley coming up - as well as tough games against Arsenal and Tottenham - Fulham could well rue missing out on two extra points here come the end of the campaign.\nWolves find a way\nSince Wolves came up as Championship winners last season and Fulham were promoted through the play-offs, the gap between these sides has increased.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have still only scored 20 times this season - three more than Fulham - but they look a much more accomplished team in possession and have a fine defensive record, conceding fewer than Manchester United and Arsenal so far.\nWith Portugal international Moutinho running play from midfield, Wolves also have threats from the bench - Cavaleiro brighter than the anonymous Adama Traore after replacing him at half-time, and fellow substitute Helder Costa putting Bryan under pressure for Saiss' equaliser.\nThis was far from Wolves' most fluent performance but they found a way to claim a point and will be delighted with an impressive first half to the season that gives them a fine chance of a top-10 finish in their first top-flight season since 2012.\nMan of the match - Joao Moutinho (Wolves)\n'A little frustrated but a draw is fair' - reaction\nFulham boss Claudio Ranieri, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am a little bit frustrated but the draw is right. Yes we missed the opportunity, but it's OK.\n\"It was a good performance from my players, everyone understood the problem and was working for the problem.\n\"When you are bottom, you have to fight, take chances, continue to fight, I am satisfied with the performance. It was only the second match we have played with this system.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I felt when Fulham scored it was unfair because we had so much of the ball and looked more likely to score - but this is the game.\n\"I am very happy with our second-half performance but in the first half we didn't quite get in the game - it was not well played because there was no space. Fulham were so well organised, they allowed us possession but were so compact, and we know how good Claudio is shaping his teams.\n\"After half-time, the players that came in for us gave width and we managed to play much better in the second half. I think we were closer [to winning], our attitude was more active in going for the game. Fulham did not risk, always looking for counter-attacks.\"\nStill just the one clean sheet for Fulham - stats\nFulham have conceded in all but one of their past 23 Premier League fixtures.\nWolverhampton Wanderers have lost just one of their past eight Premier League games in London, winning three.\nWolves have scored 75% of their league goals in the second half of their games this season (15 of 20), the highest proportion in the competition.\nSince his league debut in August 2016, Ryan Sessegnon has been directly involved in more league goals (including play-offs) than any other Fulham player (23 goals, 14 assists).\nAt 18 years and 221 days old, Sessegnon is the third-youngest player to score in the Premier League on 26 December, after James Milner (16 years on 356 days in 2002) and Michael Owen (18 years and 12 days in 1997).\nWolves midfielder Romain Saiss scored his first Premier League goal, becoming the 14th Moroccan to score in the competition, and the first since Sofiane Boufal for Southampton against Tottenham on 26 December last year.\nWhat's next?\nFulham host Huddersfield in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off) before travelling to London rivals Arsenal on New Year's Day (15:00).\nWolves have a league game at Tottenham at 15:00 on Saturday and host Crystal Palace on Wednesday, 2 January at 19:45."

Paul Pogba (Man Utd)\nWhat next?\nManchester United host Bournemouth on Sunday (kick-off 16:30 GMT), while Huddersfield travel to Fulham on Saturday (15:00).\nSolskjaer's super start - the stats\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer is just the fifth Manchester United manager to win both of his first two league matches in charge, after TJ Wallworth, Matt Busby, Dave Sexton and Jose Mourinho.\nHuddersfield Town have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 15 away games against Manchester United in the league (45 goals conceded).\nManchester United have not lost a home league game on Boxing Day since 1978-79 (3-0 v Liverpool), winning 15 and drawing three since.\nHuddersfield are only the fourth team in Premier League history to lose six matches in one calendar month - Norwich (April 1995), Wimbledon (April 2000), Leicester (April 2001) being the others.\nUnited's Jesse Lingard has been directly involved in six goals in his last five appearances in the Premier League (4 goals, 2 assists).\nUnited midfielder Paul Pogba scored two goals in a Premier League for the first time since netting twice against Manchester City in April at the Etihad.\nPogba has been directly involved in four goals in two Premier League games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (2 goals, 2 assists), the same total he had registered in his last 12 games under Mourinho (1 goal, 3 assists).\nNemanja Matic scored his first Premier League goal for United in 23 appearances, since netting against Crystal Palace in March. It was his first in the competition at Old Trafford for the club."

I didn't like it too much.\n\"But apart from that the whole game was really good. We could've scored more, the chances were there with fantastic movements. Right to the end we were wanting to control the game but still wanted to score.\n\"It's difficult to break down Newcastle's formation. They worked hard but the boys stayed in the game and did the job.\"\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez: \"We knew we were playing a very good team and knew staying in the game was crucial.\n\"At the start of the second half there was a light penalty - it's hard when you're 2-0 down. If you have chances and don't take them or make mistakes it is difficult.\n\"The first goal is a mistake and the second is key in terms of confidence.\"\nStill a miracle to keep Newcastle up? \"Yes. You can see the difference between some teams. We have to carry on doing things right and we have to be better than three teams.\"\n'The unbeatables' - the stats\nLiverpool are only the fourth Premier League team to be unbeaten at the halfway stage of a season, along with Arsenal in 2003-04, Manchester United in 2010-11 and Manchester City in 2017-18.\nThis was Newcastle's heaviest league defeat at Anfield since December 1987 (also a 0-4 loss).\nMohamed Salah has been involved in 35 goals in 28 home Premier League games for Liverpool (25 goals, 10 assists).\nNewcastle have now lost their last nine away league matches against the 'big six' teams and have been beaten in all six games those sides this season.\nXherdan Shaqiri has scored four goals in his past four Premier League matches - one more than he managed in the 20 before that.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 20 matches in December, winning their past nine in a row.\nThis was the Reds' seventh victory this month - their most in a calendar month since September 1996 (also seven).\nWhat's next?\nThe games come thick and fast and Liverpool face another huge match on Saturday when they host Arsenal (17:30 GMT) before heading to Manchester City on 3 January (20:00).\nNewcastle are at Watford on Saturday (15:00) before hosting Manchester United on 2 January (20:00)."

two more than they did in the entire 2017-18 campaign.\nBernard, Sigurdsson and Walcott pulled the strings as Everton enjoyed large spells of possession, having killed the game as a contest in the first quarter.\nGibson, who was making his Premier League debut for the Clarets following his summer move from Middlesbrough, handed his side a lifeline with a scrambled goal.\nAnd Tarkowski could have reduced the arrears to just one goal, but his side-footed effort from close range sailed over the bar.\nDigne's second ended the last of Burnley's resistance after 26 minutes of the second half, and Dyche's side will need to produce more at either end to arrest their current decline.\nMan of the match - Yerry Mina (Everton)\nBurnley all at sea in defence - the stats\nBurnley have already conceded 41 goals in the Premier League this season after 19 games, two more than they shipped in the whole of last season (39).\nEverton have scored five goals in an away Premier League game for only the third time ever and the first time since a 5-2 win at Sheffield Wednesday in April 1996.\nAt one minute and 39 seconds, Yerry Mina's goal for Everton was the quickest Premier League goal on Boxing Day since 2014 when both Harry Kane and Adam Johnson both scored within the first minute.\nMina's opener is the quickest Premier League goal by an Everton player since Tom Davies scored against Leicester after 30 seconds in April 2017.\nFive of the eight goals scored by Everton's Lucas Digne in Europe's big five leagues have come from outside the box, including each of his three for the Toffees.\nBurnley goalkeeper Joe Hart has conceded 41 goals in 19 games in the Premier League this season; only in 2009-10 (42 in 36 games) did he ship more in a single campaign in the competition.\nGylfi Sigurdsson has scored 12 Premier League goals for Everton since the start of last season, more than any other player.\nRicharlison has netted nine goals in 17 Premier League appearances this season with Everton, four more than he scored with Watford last season (five in 38 appearances).\n'They deserved to win' - what they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche told BBC Match of the Day: \"They started much brighter, much sharper with more energy. They were the better side and deserved to win.\n\"The last 10 minutes of the half we deserved to get back in it and the game settled. We got a bit more on the front foot, scored a goal and all of sudden the next goal is vital.\n\"The chance for Tarkowski is massive. If we put that in, after what happened to Everton against Tottenham the other day, then it may change the whole event. We then started the second half the brighter and you never know from then. But it didn't go in and the game went after that.\"\nEverton boss Marco Silva speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"The first thing I'd like to say is this is for our fans and our players.\n\"The fans welcomed our players before the match, which is fantastic after a tough result on Sunday. And the players as well, they deserve this.\n\"It was a good win for us and now is the moment to rest and prepare for the other quick games.\"\nOn responding to Sunday's defeat by Tottenham: \"I think the best solution to the last result was to play as quickly as you can, luckily for us we played after three days.\n\"They showed they are here to fight, to compete and to show the ambition we have as a club.\"\nOn goalscorer Lucas Digne: \"I think the credit has to go to all the squad and not just one or two, but of course Lucas Digne has done well and settled. We never had any doubts about his quality or his attitude. His left foot is fantastic.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley entertain West Ham at Turf Moor on Sunday, 30 December (14:15 GMT), while Everton are on the road again as they travel to Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday, 29 December (15:00 GMT)."

But, just like against Palace, Guardiola's side let their opponents back into the game within minutes of going in front.\nTheir lead over Palace only lasted six minutes on Saturday, and it only took Leicester five minutes to peg Guardiola's team back at the King Power Stadium.\nPoor defending, and Vardy being given space to cross from the left side of the penalty area, saw Albrighton get himself clear of marker Delph at the back post to head past Ederson.\nCity had chances to retake the lead with Aguero surprisingly scooping the ball over from six yards out from Leroy Sane's pull-back.\nKevin de Bruyne, making his first Premier League start of the season after knee injuries, did well to create space for a low cross, but Kasper Schmeichel did well to hold on to the ball as Aguero waited to pounce.\nThe away side had the majority of possession in the second half, but Sane's poor header late on was punished with a spectacular finish from Ricardo.\nCity are aiming to win the Premier League for a fourth time in eight seasons and have 44 points, with Liverpool, who they play at home on 3 January, on 51 points after their 4-0 home win over Newcastle.\nMauricio Pochettino's Tottenham have also moved above City, thanks to their 5-0 home success over Bournemouth.\nLeicester gain another excellent result\nA run of only one win in eight matches in all competitions had led to speculation concerning the future of Foxes manager Claude Puel.\nHowever, his side have responded by winning 1-0 at Chelsea on Saturday and now became only the third side to beat Manchester City in the league this season.\nDespite conceding so early on, Leicester's players quickly got themselves back into it and ended the first half strongly with Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson saving efforts from Vardy, James Maddison and Hamza Choudhury.\nIn the second half, Leicester had to defend deep, but Puel's side produced an organised, disciplined performance to restrict the away team to only four shots on target.\nKasper Schmeichel was a calming figure in the Leicester goal and a number of players, including Harry Maguire and Wes Morgan, made crucial blocks to frustrate Guardiola's men.\nThose saves and desperate defending proved crucial before Ricardo's goal took Leicester back up to seventh, only four points behind sixth-placed Manchester United.\nMan of the match - Ricardo Pereira (Leicester)\nAnother Guardiola defeat in December - the stats\nThis is the first time Man City have lost consecutive Premier League games since December 2016, with the second defeat in that run also coming away against Leicester.\nLeicester have won their last two Premier League games against 'big six' opposition, as many as they had in their previous 19 in the competition (won two, drew two, lost 15).\nSix of Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola's 11 Premier League defeats have come in the month of December.\nMan City's Bernardo Silva has had a hand in nine goals in his 18 Premier League appearances this season (five goals, four assists), just one fewer than in his 35 games in the competition last term (six goals, four assists).\nWith Ricardo Pereira scoring for Leicester, and Bernardo Silva netting for Man City, this was the first time a Premier League match saw a Portuguese player score for both sides.\n'We have lots to fight for' - what they said\nLeicester manager Claude Puel told BBC Sport: \"A good Boxing Day. We know when you play Chelsea and City it's difficult to have the ball but you must have this mentality to defend together and try to use good recovery and fast passes to break.\n\"We deserved this result. We had more chances than them. We changed the system to get a better balance in the team and it is a fantastic result for this team.\n\"Some players are very tired. It was important to put the same team on the pitch. We didn't play well against Crystal Palace but we have had two fantastic games.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"It was a similar performance to the Crystal Palace game, we started well but conceded a goal the first time they arrived in our box. Mentally we are lacking confidence in that situation.\n\"We have to accept it, we have to realise that we have to work harder and try to get immediately one good result and get our confidence back.\n\"Of course we are worried [about not keeping clean sheets], the result is what counts, we lost. In four days we have another one. We are together, we will work harder and we will come back with some good results. The season is very long and we have lots to fight for.\n\"It was another fantastic goal against us. There are games when your opponents have clear chances and don't score and games when they score goals like this.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester are at home to Cardiff City on Saturday, 29 December and they play at Everton on Tuesday, 1 January.\nFor Manchester City, they will be trying to get back to winning ways at Southampton on 30 December, before a home game against league leaders Liverpool on 3 January."

This was their 12th victory in 14 games in all competitions and one that maintains their best start to a Premier League season.\nTwenty-four days after a humbling defeat by north London rivals Arsenal that meant they started December by dropping out of the top four, Spurs are in the last 16 of the Champions League, the Carabao Cup semi-finals and now sit second in the Premier League.\nOn chairman Daniel Levy's Christmas wishlist will have no doubt have been moving into the club's new home, fending off interest in their sought-after boss and adding silverware to their trophy cabinet for the first time in more than a decade.\nBut Levy and manager Pochettino will surely be delighted at Spurs' festive period so far as they added to Sunday's 6-2 victory at Everton with another clinical attacking display.\nPochettino has suggested the club may go a second transfer window without making a signing in January, and he can be thankful for the performance of one of the club's academy products against Bournemouth.\nWalker-Peters continuously got the better of Charlie Daniels to create Tottenham's opening three goals, pinching the ball off the Bournemouth left-back before teeing up Son's first and then drifting on to a well-weighted pass from another of Spurs' graduates, Harry Winks, to set up Moura.\nThe 21-year-old was assured defensively too, which can reassure Pochettino that he can be called on if Spurs look to rotate while attempting to compete on four fronts.\nHowe in Spurs audition?\nPochettino's name is likely to keep being linked with the vacant Manchester United manager's job until the Old Trafford club announce a full-time successor to Jose Mourinho.\nShould Tottenham fail to keep the Argentine, Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe may well top their list of potential replacements.\nBut things did not go to plan on Wednesday for the 41-year-old - whose tenure with the Cherries is nearing a decade, either side of a 21-month spell at Burnley - as his side's defensive frailties were unmasked by a ruthless Tottenham performance.\nHowe has a similar knack to Pochettino for developing young, talented players, with midfielders Fraser and Brooks impressing at Wembley, despite the scoreline.\nBrooks - who was released by Manchester City and spent time on loan at Halifax before joining the Cherries from Sheffield United in the summer - has flourished under the Englishman and proved his team's main creative outlet.\nHad the Wales international latched on to Lerma's pass in the first half, things may have been different for the visitors.\nMan of the match - Kyle Walker-Peters (Tottenham)\nWhat the managers said\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The effort was fantastic. To have one day less after Everton, I am very pleased with the performance.\n\"It is important to manage confidence in the right way, victory make us believe. Of course, think step-by-step and be ready to arrive at the next game in the best condition.\n\"We are only halfway to end of the season, we need to replicate the same second-half of the season. It is up to us, if we show the same quality and same belief and behave in the same way, then maybe at end of season I'll talk in a way that maybe we fight for big things.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It was a tough one - one of those days every shot they had went in, every shot we had didn't.\n\"You have to admire qualities they have but it is disappointing we created so many opportunities ourselves. If we had got one back it might have been different.\n\"We conceded some bad goals, [which is] hugely frustrating on the back of a clean sheet. We wanted to build momentum.\n\"It is a tough Christmas period. We go to Manchester United and try and put it right.\"\nCherries hate playing Spurs - the stats\nTottenham are yet to draw after 19 Premier League games this season - the longest run in a top-flight season since Arsenal in 1983-84 (also 19 games).\nThe 5-0 defeat is Bournemouth's biggest in the Premier League and their largest in the league since a 6-1 loss to Watford in the Championship in August 2013.\nThe Cherries have conceded 22 goals in their seven Premier League games against Spurs, at an average of 3.1 per game.\nEddie Howe has lost six league games to Tottenham, only being beaten more times by Manchester City (seven).\nChristian Eriksen has scored 18 Premier League goals from outside the area - the most of any Spurs player in the competition's history.\nEriksen has assisted Harry Kane 18 times in the league - with only Frank Lampard to Didier Drogba (24), Darren Anderton to Teddy Sheringham (20) and Steve McManaman to Robbie Fowler (20) combining more.\nTottenham's Son Heung-Min has had a hand in 10 goals in his past nine Premier League appearances, scoring seven and creating three.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Wolves at Wembley on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off), while Bournemouth travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United in Sunday's 16:30 kick-off."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-0 Cardiff City: Hodgson frustrated by wasteful finishing\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says his team's wastefulness in front of goal has cost them a \"lot more points\" after a frustrating draw against Cardiff.\nPalace peppered the Cardiff goal with 31 shots, their highest number since 2003-04, with Andros Townsend flicking a shot against the crossbar and Luka Milivojevic hitting the post for the hosts.\nBut their failure to build upon their clinical victory at Manchester City four days ago left Hodgson to rue the quality of their finishing.\n\"I'm pleased about the number of chances we created but I'm not pleased we didn't convert one of them,\" he said.\n\"It's something we've had to deal with for a large part of the season. If we had more fortune in front of goal then we would be nowhere near where we are, we'd have assembled a lot more points.\n\"Football is about scoring goals and taking those semi opportunities, which good goal scorers find a way of scoring.\"\nCardiff's ability to survive - particularly in the second period, when 23 shots rained in on Neil Etheridge's goal - ensured they collected their second point of the season on their travels to edge clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\nStill smarting from their 5-1 defeat to Manchester United, the visitors delivered the sort of performance that Neil Warnock sides are renowned for - doggedly defending and attempting to counter when possible.\nWhile the Bluebirds had limited goal-scoring opportunities, they were denied the ultimate smash-and-grab victory by Palace keeper Vicente Guaita, who superbly saved from Kadeem Harris at point blank range.\nThe result leaves Palace in 14th place on 19 points while Cardiff remain 17th on 15 points.\nZaha and Milivojevic set the tone for wasteful Palace\nWilf Zaha and Luka Milivojevic again played the role of main protagonists for Palace who controlled proceedings without delivering the precise finishing that upset Pep Guardiola's side.\nThe 27-year-old Serbian international has played more passes than any Palace player in seven of their last 10 outings but is also adept at altering his game to suit the circumstances.\nAnd when Townsend was fouled by Cardiff midfielder Victor Camarasa he almost added to his tally of three goals in his last five outings. But he was unfortunate to see a perfectly executed free-kick from 20-yards cannon back off the left post.\nZaha was another to impress for Palace, conjuring chances and moments of excitement with deft flicks, like the one that set-up Townsend early on, and his close control bamboozled the visiting defenders throughout.\nThe Ivory Coast forward was also superbly denied by Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge late on, who tipped his fizzing drive away for a corner.\nAnd while he could not deliver a knock-out blow for Palace, the inventiveness he displayed to provide Max Meyer and Connor Wickham with gilt-edged chances warranted more than the errant finishing that followed.\nStubborn Cardiff refuse to buckle\nCardiff arrived at Selhurst Park after averaging just 27% possession and three shots on target in their previous two defeats.\nAnd put simply, in those 5-1 and 3-2 reverses they were guilty of turning over possession far too easily and too close to their own goal to gain positive results.\nThat trend continued into the first 25 minutes of this encounter before they found their feet with Junior Hoilett registering the Bluebirds' first shot on target after a move down the right.\nHoilett's touch then deserted him at the start of the second period as a promising opening concluded with a tame finish from a tight angle.\nWhile Harris could have won the game for Cardiff the result was largely constructed on their collective effort at the other end of the pitch.\n\"It would be the biggest achievement of my career by an absolute mile [to keep Cardiff up],\" Warnock said.\n\"We're looking at bringing players in [in January] but it's not simple. We're not going to spend stupid money. One or two have done that in the past and it's not been the right thing for the club.\"\nAside from reinforcements, Warnock will also be reliant on his squad's ability to bounce back from damaging moments - a quality exemplified by defenders Sean Morrison and Sol Bamba.\nThe duo made just seven clearances in a shambolic display against United, but here they combined to make 24 as Cardiff players routinely obstructed the path towards their goal.\nFourteen Palace shots were blocked and when the Cardiff defence was breached, a combination of exerting enough pressure on the attackers and Etheridge's competency prevented Palace from breaking the deadlock.\nMan of the match - Sean Morrison (Cardiff City)\nBattle of the golden oldies - the stats\nCrystal Palace mustered 31 shots in the game, their highest tally of shots in a Premier League game since 2003-04.\nCrystal Palace's 31 shots was the joint-most Cardiff have ever faced in a Premier League game, level with their clash with Norwich City in October 2013 which also ended 0-0.\nCardiff are winless in their last five league games played on Boxing Day (D2 L3), with their last such win coming against Crystal Palace in 2012-13 (2-1).\nCrystal Palace have registered three consecutive home clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since April 2017.\nThis game was the first-ever Premier League meeting between two managers aged over 70, with Cardiff boss Neil Warnock aged 70y 25d and Crystal Palace's Roy Hodgson aged 71y 139d on the day of the game.\nEach of Roy Hodgson's five Premier League games on Boxing Day have ended 0-0.\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock is unbeaten in his last 10 away league games at Selhurst Park (W6 D4).\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace welcome Chelsea to Selhurst Park on Sunday 30 December (12:00 GMT), while Cardiff travel to Leicester on Saturday 29th December (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Arsenal: Seagulls end losing run with draw against disjointed Gunners\nBrighton ended a run of three consecutive defeats by holding a disjointed Arsenal to a draw at the Amex Stadium.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang curled in the opening goal following fine work from Alexandre Lacazette after just seven minutes.\nThe Gunners dominated the opening half hour and the Seagulls required two superb saves from goalkeeper Mat Ryan on Aubameyang to stay in the game.\nArsenal right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner then made a poor mistake, heading a long ball into the path of Brighton striker Jurgen Locadia, who rounded Bernd Leno to equalise on 35 minutes.\nMesut Ozil was replaced at half-time but the visitors failed to regain their early composure and rarely tested Brighton's defence.\nThe hosts pressed for a winner, catching out a ragged Arsenal on the counter-attack, but Locadia and Solly March both missed promising chances.\nArsenal remain fifth in the table, but are now two points behind Chelsea, who beat Watford 2-1 on Wednesday night.\nA statement substitution?\nArsenal boss Unai Emery and Ozil have had a curious relationship this season and the decision to substitute the midfielder for Alex Iwobi at half-time will only add to that intrigue.\nEmery recently insisted Ozil has a future at the club and the former Germany international responded with an inspirational performance in victory over Burnley but could not exert the same influence here.\nYet he did not play badly and was far from the biggest reason why Arsenal let Brighton back into the game after a commanding opening spell.\nOzil may not have tracked back from the corner that led to Brighton's goal but the poor positioning of Arsenal's centre-backs and Lichtsteiner's woeful header from Davy Propper's speculative pass were more culpable.\nLichtsteiner was fortunate to not be replaced - his passing accuracy below 60% for much of the game before a late recovery to finish on 69.6%.\nAnd without Ozil in the second half, Arsenal lacked creativity and were still vulnerable to Brighton's counter-attacks, resulting in Emery using all of his substitutions by 70 minutes as Aaron Ramsey and Ainsley Maitland-Niles were sent on for Lacazette and Laurent Koscielny respectively.\nEven then, Arsenal's best openings only came from Brighton mistakes or by accident - an attempted clearance deflecting narrowly wide off Iwobi late on.\nEmery appears to want to challenge Ozil and has made shrewd substitutions to help his side surge in the second half but Iwobi did very little in Ozil's place and removing the German was perhaps the wrong call here.\nBrighton recover after worrying start\nAfter relatively narrow defeats by Burnley, Chelsea and Bournemouth in recent weeks, it felt like Brighton would slip to a far heavier fourth-straight loss here in the early stages.\nThe Seagulls could not keep hold of the ball - Arsenal nearing 85% possession after the first 20 minutes - and their defence showed frequent lapses in concentration, allowing the Gunners to regularly carve through.\nFor the opener, Lacazette charged down a clearance and won the ball back in the area, holding off three Brighton defenders before flicking the ball on for Aubameyang to pick out the top-right corner.\nBut Ryan was alert. After four minutes, Aubameyang ran onto Matteo Guendouzi's ball over the top and tried to chip the Brighton keeper, who stretched to tip it away.\nThe Australia international then made an excellent low save to his right once Aubameyang was put clear through by Lucas Torreira's long pass and Brighton will miss him once he goes on Asian Cup duty throughout January, when he could be absent for seven games if Australia make the final.\nAt that stage, Brighton's only real chance was when Glenn Murray thought he had bundled in an equaliser after scuffing his first-time effort, but referee Anthony Taylor penalised the striker for a foul on Leno.\nYet once Arsenal showed how vulnerable they were defensively for Locadia's goal, Brighton attacked with increased confidence and came close to a late winner.\nCaptain Dale Stephens picked out March and then Locadia with two exquisite long passes in behind the Arsenal defence but the former lifted his chip well over the bar and the latter dragged his left-footed effort wide.\nMan of the match - Mat Ryan (Brighton)\n'We should've scored more early on' - reaction\nArsenal boss Unai Emery speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm a little disappointed. The first half was key in the match. We started winning and had another two chances, and they saved from Aubameyang.\n\"We didn't concede many chances but they drew level. In the second half we could not impose our gameplan. We did not make more clear chances to win the match.\n\"If we scored our chances in the first half we could have won.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's always a good point but I'm really happy with the reaction of the team. If they got a second goal in that good period they had, it becomes a really hard afternoon.\n\"But we worked ourselves into a really good game and as the second half became more open, on the balance of play we looked more likely to score. Solly March's chance was the best of the game.\"\nArsenal's second-half scoring run ends - stats\nArsenal have conceded in each of their last nine away Premier League games, only going longer without an away shut-out in the competition in a run of 11 ending in October 2010.\nArsenal failed to score in the second half for the first time in their last 17 Premier League games, since losing to Chelsea on 18 August.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in 30 goals in his 32 Premier League appearances for Arsenal, scoring 23 and assisting seven.\nSince Aubameyang's debut for Arsenal in February, no duo has combined for more Premier League goals than the Gabon striker and Alexandre Lacazette (six, level with Bouremouth's Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser and Tottenham's Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen).\nBrighton's Jurgen Locadia scored for the first time in his last 18 Premier League games, since scoring on his debut in the competition in February against Swansea City,\nBrighton have lost just two of their last 12 Premier League home games, winning five and drawing five.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton host Everton on Saturday at 15:00 GMT before travelling to West Ham on Wednesday, 2 January at 19:45.\nArsenal face Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday at 17:30 and host London rivals Fulham on New Year's Day at 15:00."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-2 Chelsea: Eden Hazard reaches 101 goals and wants to be Blues 'legend'\nEden Hazard says he wants to become a \"Chelsea legend\" after his two goals secured victory at Watford - and took him past 100 goals for the Blues.\nHazard, 27, became only the 10th player to reach that landmark when he collected Mateo Kovacic's pass, took the ball around goalkeeper Ben Foster and calmly finished in first-half injury time.\nChelsea's lead only lasted two minutes as Roberto Pereyra volleyed past Kepa Arrizabalaga from the edge of the 18-yard box to level.\nBut Hazard grabbed his second of the match - his 101st Chelsea goal in 322 appearances - in the second half when he converted a penalty after Foster had bundled him over.\nThe Belgium forward has been repeatedly linked with a move to Real Madrid and in October said it was his \"dream\" to join the Spanish side, although two days after that he ruled out a move to the Bernabeu in the January transfer window.\n\"To score 101 goals with this amazing club is something I will never forget, but now the fans, staff and players want more,\" said Hazard, who helped Chelsea win the Premier League title in 2015 and 2017.\n\"I want to score more for this club and then try to be a legend like Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and John Terry.\"\nHis goals took the Blues back up to fourth after they had dropped below Arsenal following the Gunners' 1-1 draw at Brighton earlier on Wednesday.\n\"Eden Hazard can play in every position,\" added Blues boss Maurizio Sarri. \"He played very well with two goals and could have had two or three assists. He can play with team-mates very well.\"\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Wednesday?\nRelive Chelsea's win over Watford as it happened\nLandmark moment for Hazard\nIt was a return to winning ways for Chelsea after they suffered a surprise 1-0 loss at home to Leicester City on Saturday and they had to work hard for the win, which leaves them 11 points behind leaders Liverpool.\nHazard, who joined Chelsea for \u00a332m from Lille in June 2012, put the visitors ahead in the first minute of injury time at the end of the first half.\nIt came after Watford's Etienne Capoue sloppily gave the ball away near the halfway line. That enabled Kovacic to break forward before releasing Hazard, and the Belgian did well to go around Foster and score his 10th league goal of the season.\nAfter Watford had equalised, Hazard's 101st club goal came in the 58th minute as he sent Foster the wrong way from the spot after the former England goalkeeper bundled him over in the penalty area.\nHazard's quality proved to be the difference as Sarri again opted to use him as a 'false nine', with Alvaro Morata injured and Olivier Giroud, who has only scored one Premier League goal in 15 appearances in 2018-19, among the substitutes.\nChelsea had further opportunities. N'Golo Kante raced onto Hazard's through ball but could only drag his effort wide, and Willian also was unlucky not to add a third for the visitors when his 20-yard strike rebounded off the outside of the post.\nThe only negatives for the Blues were a hamstring injury for Pedro and then the man who replaced him, 18-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi, also going off late on.\nWatford's unbeaten run ends\nWatford will feel they had enough chances to get something from the match at Vicarage Road as they suffered their first loss in four Premier League matches.\nThey had a chance after only nine minutes when Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga gifted a clearance to Gerard Deulofeu, but the Spaniard squandered the opportunity with a misplaced backheel that did not find team-mate Troy Deeney.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure had a shot blocked by Jorginho and also fired a second attempt over the bar, before Deeney was denied by an excellent David Luiz challenge.\nHazard put the visitors ahead, but they were soon pegged back as Pereyra spectacularly volleyed in from Jose Holebas' cross.\nWhen it was still 1-1, Watford thought they should have had a penalty as Luiz collided with Deulofeu. Referee Martin Atkinson was not interested - but gave Chelsea a spot-kick of their own six minutes later, which Hazard converted.\nThe Hornets still had chances to secure a point, but Deeney shot over from eight yards out before keeper Foster joined the attack in injury time and attempted a long-range overhead kick, but failed to threaten Arrizabalaga's goal.\nWatford had started the day seventh, but wins for Leicester and Everton, against Manchester City and Burnley respectively, have dropped Javi Gracia's team down to ninth.\nAfter the match, Gracia confirmed that defender Christian Kabasele had been taken to hospital following a worrying injury after only nine minutes, when he slid into a post as he tried to stop Willian from scoring.\nKabasele continued after extensive treatment but only lasted a few more minutes before he was substituted, and was then carried down the tunnel on a stretcher.\nChelsea's fine 26 December record - the stats\nChelsea have only lost one of their seven Premier League games against opponents that started the day in the top 10 this season (won three, drew three), with that defeat coming against Spurs in November (3-1 at Wembley).\nAfter losing just three of their first 13 home league games under Javi Gracia (won eight, drew two), Watford have since lost three of their past four.\nChelsea are unbeaten in their past 14 league games played on 26 December (won nine, drew five), since a 4-2 loss at Charlton in 2003-04.\nOnly Brighton (five) have conceded more penalties than Watford (four) in the Premier League this season, with three of those being converted.\nHornets midfielder Roberto Pereyra has scored three goals in three Premier League appearances against Chelsea - more than against any other opponent in the competition.\nThere were just 137 seconds between Chelsea opening the scoring and Watford equalising.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\n'I think it was a penalty' - what they said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia told Sky Sports: \"I think we competed very well. I think we started the second half well by pressing high, but in that moment if you make a mistake they can score a second goal. Maybe after we scored our goal, in that moment we were playing better but we conceded the second.\n\"We know they are a very good team and maybe if there was another decision when we were playing and Gerard Deulofeu goes into the box, maybe it could have been different. I think it was a penalty.\"\nOn the Watford goal: \"We try to practice different corner kicks and I am happy for the goal but today it was not enough. We will try to improve and be better.\nOn Christian Kabasele: \"At this moment I do not know anything because he is not with us, he is in the hospital.\"\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri told BBC Sport: \"Maybe Saturday in the first half we played with more quality than today. We had more attention and our determination continued for 90 minutes. We could have won with another result because in the last 20-25 minutes we missed opportunities. At the end of the match, we did very well, especially mentally.\n\"We don't know how much Pedro is injured, we will evaluate tomorrow. That is the same problem with Callum Hudson-Odoi. He had a little injury a few days ago, yesterday it was good and he managed 50-55 minutes. We thought it was better to substitute him.\n\"We have to try to stay close to the top four. The target this season could only be to stay close and to enter into the Champions League. Liverpool are playing really well especially with the continuity to win the Premier League.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford play at home against Newcastle on 29 December and are then away at Bournemouth on 2 January. Chelsea are at Crystal Palace on 30 December before entertaining Southampton on 2 January."

the most of any team in the competition, with 12 of those coming in home games.\nWest Ham have won five of their last six games in the Premier League (lost one) - their previous five wins in the competition came over a run of 20 games between April and November.\nThis was West Ham's first Premier League away win after conceding the opening goal since May 2017, when they won 2-1 against Burnley at Turf Moor.\nSouthampton have suffered back-to-back Premier League defeats against West Ham for the first time since October 2001 (a run of four).\nWest Ham have won 15 points in the Premier League in December (P6 W5 D0 L1); their most in a single month of a season in competition history.\nAfter scoring just once in his opening 10 Premier League appearances, West Ham midfielder Felipe Anderson has scored seven goals in his past nine.\nSouthampton winger Nathan Redmond has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since October 2016.\nThere were just 168 seconds between Southampton opening the scoring and West Ham equalising through Felipe Anderson's strike.\nMan of the match - Felipe Anderson (West Ham)\n'We were not so fresh' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport: \"The way we lost it was too easy, we didn't play such a good game.\n\"If you give it away like we did then you don't deserve to win. We were not so fresh and not so speedy, [or] sharp to win the second balls.\n\"We ran a lot without the ball, at half-time we changed a few things put early pressure on and scored the first goal. [Their goals were] too easy, one from outside the box and one from a corner we had.\"\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to Sky Sports: \"All the credit [to the players]. We played a very good game from the first minute to win the game and we were very balanced in the whole game.\n\"We worked mostly in the opposition side and we defended very well. They didn't have too many options. It's important we drew level immediately and scored the winning goal.\"\nOn match-winner Felipe Anderson: \"Of course he is a different player, a player that in every game makes important plays - he will continue improving.\n\"He still loses too many balls, maybe because he must understand the Premier League is difficult if you keep the ball in your feet.\"\nWhat next?\nIt doesn't get any easier for Southampton, who on Sunday host a Manchester City side looking to make amends for back-to-back defeats.\nOn the same day, West Ham host Burnley, who were beaten 5-1 at home by Everton on Wednesday."

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-0 Huddersfield Town: Aleksandar Mitrovic scores stoppage-time winner\nAleksandar Mitrovic scored a stoppage-time winner as Fulham secured what could be a priceless victory against bottom side Huddersfield.\nMitrovic slid the ball low past Jonas Lossl for his eighth goal of the season after being played in by substitute Ryan Sessegnon following a swift counter-attack.\nJust minutes earlier, Aboubakar Kamara saw his spot-kick saved by Lossl with eight minutes remaining after Chris Lowe had been penalised for handball.\nThe win, Fulham's first in seven matches, moves Fulham above Burnley and to within one point of safety. Huddersfield remain bottom after a seventh successive defeat, equalling a club record set in 1955.\nThe most relieved player on the field will be Fulham striker Kamara, who refused to give the ball to Mitrovic for the Cottagers' late penalty, leaving the Serbian striker furious.\nThankfully for Kamara, he did not regret that miss for long, with Mitrovic's late goal earning what could be a hugely significant victory at the end of the season.\nThe late drama was at odds with what had been a largely dour game lacking in quality in front of goal.\nMitrovic had Fulham's best opportunity when his powerful near-post header from Joe Bryan's cross was well saved by Lossl.\nHuddersfield, meanwhile, failed to truly test Sergio Rico in the Fulham goal, with the game rounding off a truly miserable December that has yielded seven straight defeats for the Yorkshire side.\nMitrovic the hero\nThe Fulham dressing room was seconds away from being a very frosty place after the dispute between Kamara and Mitrovic over that late penalty.\nStriker Mitrovic was seen pleading with the Fulham bench to allow him to take the spot-kick, but Kamara's refusal to give him the ball meant he simply had to score or risk the wrath of his team-mate.\nKamara's dramatic miss led manager Claudio Ranieri to remark after the game that he \"wanted to kill\" the French striker.\nIt looked to be the final act of a game that had failed to spark into life and leave Mitrovic seething, but his late intervention again highlights how important the 24-year-old is to Fulham's fortunes.\nClaudio Ranieri says he 'wanted to kill' Aboubakar Kamara\nNo player has scored more goals for Fulham this year than Mitrovic's 20, following his initial loan move from Newcastle at the start of February.\nThe Serbian again had more efforts on goal than any other Cottager but must have been fearing a repeat of what happened against Wolves on Wednesday, when he had eight efforts at goal without scoring.\nThat made it six games without a goal for the former Newcastle forward since scoring twice in Claudio Ranieri's first game in charge against Southampton as the Italian looks to employ a more conservative approach.\nThose tactics are slowly starting to yield results however, with Saturday's win making it three matches unbeaten over Christmas with just one goal conceded to edge closer to safety.\nIf they are to complete a dramatic escape from the drop, then Mitrovic's goals will be central to it.\nFamiliar failings haunt Huddersfield\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner admitted he \"never\" stops thinking about relegation in the build-up to this game and that prospect once again edged closer to reality after yet another defeat.\nIt is clear where Huddersfield's problems lie. The total of 12 goals they have mustered this season is comfortably the worst in the Premier League and leaves them five points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table.\nHis two strikers, Laurent Depoitre and Steve Mounie, have not scored a goal between them but what will have been most concerning to Wagner at Craven Cottage was their failure to even create any clear-cut chances.\nThe Terriers had 76% possession in the opening 15 minutes but their only shot on goal was an optimistic long-range effort from Philip Billing that was comfortably saved by Sergio Rico.\nThey would only muster four shots on target for the rest of the game, but none of them truly tested the Fulham goalkeeper.\nWhen they did commit more men forward, in the first minute of stoppage time, they were caught on the counter-attack, with the defeat wrapping up a miserable month for the Yorkshire club.\nThe Terriers' have lost seven successive games for the first time in 63 years - equalling a club record - and are the first team in the Premier League to lose seven games in a calendar month since Leicester in April 2001.\nMan of the Match - Aleksandar Mitrovic\nI'm so happy I want to cry - what they said\nAleksandar Mitrovic speaking to BBC Sport: \"We had a small argument and I think it is my job for penalties. He did not think like this but I respect that. I have done the same in the past.\n\"I don't have a problem with this, he missed and that is part of football. He changed the game when he came on in the second half.\n\"Last time I said I am so unhappy I want to cry, today I want to say I am so happy I want to cry. It is a big three points, we kept another clean sheet and that is a big improvement for us.\n\"Today was a six-point game against rivals at the bottom and it was a very important game. It gives us confidence before facing Arsenal. We need to carry on winning games and taking points.\"\nHuddersfield head coach David Wagner speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is hard to take. If you see how we conceded it makes it harder.\n\"We had a good opportunity for the counter and could not finish then could not close the gaps and conceded after Jonas Lossl made a great penalty save.\n\"Today was a game with a lack of creativity from both sides - some shots from both sides and set plays but it was not a good game. We defended the counter well until the stoppage time situation.\"\n'It's a lack of professionalism and you shouldn't do it'\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day: \"Mitrovic is the designated penalty taker. It's a lack of professionalism [from Kamara] and you shouldn't do it.\n\"It's not about him, it's about the team. It's hard enough taking penalties. You have to score this, otherwise you make a right prat of yourself.\n\"You can see Mitrovic - he's waving to Ranieri saying 'what on earth is going on'. To be fair to him he does go over [to Kamara] and he gets a big cheer off the crowd for that, but he's got to score.\n\"The manager was absolutely right and fuming. You can't do it.\"\nCottagers snatch late win - the stats\nFulham recorded their second victory in eight Premier League games under Claudio Ranieri (D3 L3), with both wins coming at Craven Cottage.\nHuddersfield have failed to score in 20 Premier League matches during 2018 - more than any other side.\nSince the start of last season, only Lukasz Fabianski (4) has saved more Premier League penalties than Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl (3).\nHuddersfield striker Steve Mounie had two shots in this game without success, taking his tally to 32 without scoring in the Premier League this season - the most of any player.\nHuddersfield lost all seven of their Premier League matches during December 2018 - the first team to do so in a single calendar month since Leicester City lost seven in April 2001.\nNone of Fulham's last 158 home league matches have ended goalless.\nWhat's next?\nFulham make the short trip to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal on New Year's Day (15:00 GMT kick-off). Huddersfield are at home to Burnley the following day (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-1 Newcastle: Javi Gracia says he was right to make changes as his side scrape draw\nJavi Gracia defended his decision to start key players on the bench as his Watford side left it late to salvage a point against Newcastle.\nWith the Hornets a goal down following Salomon Rondon's 29th-minute header, Gracia brought on skipper Troy Deeney and midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure, who headed in the equaliser eight minutes from time.\nThe Watford manager made six changes to his starting XI as his side played a third Premier League game in eight days.\nWhen asked if that was too many he said: \"If you see the result you can say that, but I don't agree.\n\"I think we started well, created good chances, clear chances and we didn't take them. After that, we knew the game would be very demanding for us but after conceding the goal it was even more difficult.\n\"At the end, I am happy with my players, maybe the game could have a different result but after seeing the game I am happy with our behaviour and how we are believing until the end.\"\nThe Hornets had dominated possession during the match but found it difficult to create chances against the Magpies, who took the lead when Rondon nodded in. The Venezuelan striker also had two goals disallowed for offside, although the first decision was marginal.\nWatford finally breached Newcastle's last line of defence in the 82nd minute when Doucoure powered home from Gerard Deulofeu's right-wing cross.\nForward Isaac Success was impressive in attack for the home side, and went close when his goal-bound shot was brilliantly blocked by Federico Fernandez.\nWatford rotation just about pays off\nGracia's decision to make six changes to his starting line-up seemed a poor choice during a match in which his side showed good intent but not much more.\nNewcastle packed the area in front of the defence and left Rondon up on his own, making it doubly difficult for the home side to find a route into the area.\nWhen they did pierce the 18-yard box they were met by unflinching resistance, with Gerard Deulofeu denied by the foot of keeper Martin Dubravka before Success saw his shot deflected wide by Fernandez.\nWatford looked increasingly less likely to find an equaliser as the match approached the final throws, but then up popped Doucoure.\nThe 25-year-old has scored some brilliant goals for the Hornets, but this was a simple in its execution from Deulofeu's delivery.\nThe point moves Watford up to ninth spot with 28 points from 20 games.\nRondon honours number nine shirt\nThe Venezuelan's display at Vicarage Road was reminiscent of another striker who once graced the Newcastle number nine shirt.\nThe club's all-time leading scorer Alan Shearer will no doubt be one of many unrestrained in their praise of a performance that almost earned the Magpies a valuable victory in a stuttering season.\nRondon, on loan from West Brom, held the ball up well, brought others into play, was a handful in the Watford box and should have come away from Vicarage Road with more than his one goal.\nAside from his first-half header from Matt Ritchie's cross, he also had two other efforts ruled out for offside - the first debatable with former Magpie Daryl Janmaat appearing to have played him onside as the striker broke away.\nNext up, it is Manchester United at home for Rondon and the Magpies.\nMan of the match - Salomon Rondon (Newcastle)\n'We can get the miracle done' - reaction\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez responding to last week's statement when he said his side would need a \"miracle\" to beat the drop:\n\"I was very clear today with the way the team was performing is the way we can get the miracle done.\n\"This group of players were playing really well and doing really well. We have to realise that for us the key has to be the team effort.\n\"Every player giving 100%. In the first-half they did well but after their substitutions they had better players, at least on paper, and that happens in the Premier League.\"\nDeulofeu in good form - the stats\nWatford have drawn a Premier League match at home for the first time since April, having won six and lost five of their last 11 matches before today.\nNewcastle have won just one of their last seven league games (D3 L3), but won three in a row prior to this recent run.\nWatford have only picked up nine points from their last 10 Premier League matches (P10 W2 D3 L5), this is 10 points fewer than from the preceding 10 games (P10 W6 D1 L3 - 19 points).\nDespite conceding late, Newcastle have only lost one of their last six away games in the top-flight (W2 D3), this after suffering five defeats in the previous seven matches on their travels.\nDeulofeu has had a direct hand in four goals in his last four Premier League games (two goals, two assists), as many goal involvements as in his previous 36 games combined.\nRondon has scored five goals in his last eight Premier League matches, as many strikes as in his previous 30 games in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWatford are at Bournemouth on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) and Newcastle host Manchester United (20:00 GMT) on the same day."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-1 Cardiff City: Claude Puel says Foxes were 'tired'\nLeicester City manager Claude Puel said \"a lot of players were tired\" as they slipped to a disappointing home defeat against Cardiff City.\nThe Foxes had beaten Chelsea and champions Manchester City in their previous two matches, and Puel said it was \"normal\" that his side should be feeling the effects \"in this busy period\".\nLeicester had 62% of the possession against Cardiff, but Victor Camarasa's stunning injury-time strike gave the Bluebirds their first away win of the season.\nAgainst the run of play, the midfielder curled home a 25-yard shot which sailed into the top corner over a flailing Kasper Schmeichel.\nCardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge had earlier produced an inspired display, including saving James Maddison's second-half penalty.\nRelive the action as it happened\nWhen the ball rebounded straight to Maddison, who looked poised to slot home, defender Sol Bamba dived in to turn the ball behind for a corner.\nThat was symptomatic of a resolute defensive effort from a Cardiff side, who kept their second clean sheet in as many matches.\nThe Foxes dominated the first half but Etheridge thwarted their best efforts, including denying Jamie Vardy when he went through on goal.\nVardy was later substituted for Kelechi Iheanacho, and Puel said: \"I manage my team on what I see and Jamie was tired.\n\"We tried to find a solution to push on with fresh players giving their best.\"\nDefeat means Leicester drop to eighth while Cardiff move above Southampton - who host Manchester City on Sunday - into 16th.\nBamba and Etheridge epitomise Cardiff display\nWhile Camarasa will draw most of the headlines for his match-winning intervention, Cardiff were only in the game at that point because of those behind him.\nEtheridge produced seven saves to deny a Leicester side full of confidence - and Neil Warnock's side will be buoyed by the fact he will remain available next month after being omitted from the Philippines squad for the Asian Cup.\nMaddison looked the player most likely to make a breakthrough, and when the England midfielder was hauled over inside the area, it looked as though the visitors' hard work would be undone.\nBut Etheridge plunged to his right to save, and Bamba was first to react as the ball broke back to Maddison.\nThat was his most crucial intervention in a match in which he kept Vardy quiet, and made more tackles (three) and more clearances (nine) than any of his team-mates.\nHis reward was a second consecutive clean sheet on the road, for a Cardiff team four points above the relegation zone.\nPressure mounting on Puel again?\nLeicester dominated the ball for large spells but rarely looked like breaching Cardiff's defence.\nThe Foxes had 16 shots at goal, with seven on target, but largely kept the ball in midfield without showing much urgency or intent to get in behind.\nOn the one occasion they did get through, Vardy - who has scored only three goals from open play this season - spurned the chance.\nLeicester's system does not get the best out of the England international - their patient build-up play not utilising the 31-year-old's pace.\nBut their unexpected victories over Chelsea and Manchester City show they have the talent and desire to match the best in the division.\nHowever, Puel's prospects will ultimately depend on results and performances against those outside the top six. And a home defeat by Cardiff is likely to, fairly or otherwise, add to the pressure on the Frenchman.\nMan of the match - Neil Etheridge (Cardiff)\n'We deserve another result' - what they said\nLeicester manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"This was another game against a team with another style of play. We had a lot of chances without finding the clinical edge.\n\"We conceded in the last minute. It's very harsh because I think we deserve another result.\n\"We needed to win this game, but it's difficult. There's a lot of disappointment because we tried.\n\"I think we had the right mentality. They're a difficult team to play against with their long throw-ins, free-kicks and second balls.\"\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I thought we deserved it overall. We had a very good plan and looked to break when we could. Our goalkeeper didn't have many saves, apart from the penalty.\n\"Other than that I thought we showed a lot of character. In the last couple of games we've really had to dig deep. We've done well against really good sides in our last two games against Palace and Leicester.\n\"We've had opportunities this season - we've missed penalties and everything else away from home. This was the first time away from home that we've deserved to win. We were the better team if I'm being honest.\"\nOn Victor Camarasa's goal: \"He's quite capable of doing that every week. He deserves it - he's a super lad.\"\nLeicester lose final match of the year... again - the stats\nCardiff registered their first away Premier League win of the season and their first in the top flight since April 2014, when they won 1-0 at Southampton.\nLeicester have lost two of their past three home Premier League matches against newly promoted sides (W1).\nWarnock has won two of his past three away league matches against Leicester (D1), having lost six of his previous seven visits there (D1).\nEleven of Cardiff's past 13 Premier League goals have been scored in the second half.\nLeicester have lost their final Premier League match in each of the past two calendar years, losing 2-1 to Liverpool last season.\nThis was Cardiff's third away Premier League clean sheet of the season - as many as they managed during the entirety of their last top-flight campaign in 2013-14.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Everton in the early kick-off on New Years Day (12:30 GMT), while Cardiff host Tottenham in the late fixture on the same day (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 1-3 Wolves: Spurs stunned by Wolves at Wembley\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said his players \"are not machines\" after their title hopes suffered an unexpected setback thanks to a dramatic comeback win by Wolves at Wembley.\nSpurs led through Harry Kane's spectacular 25-yard strike in the first half but Wolves punished a poor second-half performance, scoring three times in the final 18 minutes to end their hosts' five-game winning run.\nThe north London side would have moved only three points behind leaders Liverpool with a win, but the defeat and the Reds' 5-1 win over Arsenal means the Merseyside club ended the day nine points clear.\n\"We have had a very good run in the last few weeks and to keep that level is difficult,\" said Pochettino, whose side won 6-2 and 5-0 against Everton and Bournemouth respectively in their last two games.\n\"We tried to play a little more in the second half, but we were too direct and I think we started to pay for the effort in the other games.\n\"We are not machines. We need to understand that we cannot get ourselves in this situation.\"\nWilly Boly brought the visitors level with a powerful header in the 72nd minute and Raul Jimenez then beat Hugo Lloris with a weak effort from the edge of the area to put Wolves in front.\nHelder Costa added a third on the counter-attack three minutes from time.\nSpurs, who did not have a single shot in the second half, remain second in the table but Manchester City can go back above them when they visit Southampton on Sunday.\nTottenham v Wolves as it happened\nLive coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\nFlat second half costs Spurs\nSpurs' performance in the second half was in a stark contrast to their previous two games, when they scored 11 goals.\nThat free-scoring form had led manager Pochettino to admit his side were \"intruders\" in the title race, but a fifth league defeat of the season halts the momentum they had built.\nThe north London side played well in the first half and had 10 efforts on goal, though most - including Kane's goal - came from distance. Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min were particularly lively.\nBut after the break they were flat and lacked cohesion, the influence of Kane, Son and Eriksen diminished, and the introduction of Lucas Moura failed to spark them into life.\nThe tension inside Wembley increased as the home support witnessed their team lose control of the game as Wolves, who had barely threatened in the first half, grew in confidence.\nAfter Boly's deserved equaliser, the Spurs fans tried to squeeze more from their team but it was Wolves, helped by some slack defending, who created all of the chances late on.\n\"We did not dominate the ball in the second half,\" Pochettino said.\n\"We were wrong in the way we tried to play, too much long ball and our energy dropped in the second half.\"\nResolute gameplan works for Wolves\nWolves' fans, players and manager Nuno Espirito Santo celebrated wildly at full-time.\nThey did not create chances in the opening 45 minutes but, unlike Everton and Bournemouth before them, defended well enough to stay in the game.\nThen, when Spurs' performance dipped, they began to exert control on the game and Nuno made the right substitutions.\nJoao Moutinho was introduced to the base of midfield in the 68th minute and dictated play, as well as providing the pin-point cross from the set-piece for Boly's equaliser.\nStriker Costa, meanwhile, came on in the 59th minute and made an excellent run before a clinical low finish to seal the game with Wolves' third goal.\nVictory means they jump to seventh in the table, one place and three points behind Manchester United.\nThey began 2018 as a promotion-chasing Championship side but end it as a team in the top half of the Premier League with a famous win over a title contender.\n\"It is good for the dressing room but to play like this at Wembley - the home of football - is the big thing,\" Nuno said.\n\"We have achieved something very special in getting to the Premier League and it has been a very special year.\n\"The second half was really really good. We managed possession, had chances and goals.\n\"We had a lot of belief after the equaliser - I would have said a draw was a good result, but I cannot control the emotions of the boys if they see space in front of them.\"\nMan of the match - Willy Boly (Wolves)\nA first for Pochettino - the best stats\nThis was Pochettino's first Premier League defeat against a newly promoted side while in charge of Spurs - the Argentine was unbeaten in 27 such meetings (W25 D2).\nWolves recorded their first Premier League win over Spurs since February 2010 (1-0 under Mick McCarthy), having gone winless in their previous five meetings in the competition (D2 L3).\nThis was only the third time Spurs have lost a Premier League home game by two or more goals under Pochettino - the other two were against Liverpool (3-0 in August 2014) and Manchester City (3-1 in April 2018).\nSpurs suffered a Premier League home defeat after opening the scoring for the first time since May 2016 (2-1 v Southampton).\nWolves have only lost two of their seven Premier League games against 'big six' opponents this season (W2 D3 L2), managing to avoid defeat in each of their three away games (W1 D2).\n47% of Spurs' goals in the Premier League this season have been scored in the month of December (20/43).\nJimenez has been directly involved in 10 of the team's 23 goals in the Premier League this season (six goals and four assists).\nKane has had a hand in 12 goals in his past 12 Premier League appearances against newly promoted teams (11 goals and one assist).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham's next game is on New Year's Day at Cardiff (17:30 GMT).

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 Everton: Locadia strike proves decisive for hosts\nJurgen Locadia's second-half goal proved decisive as Brighton beat Everton to end 2018 with another win at the Amex Stadium.\nThe Dutchman's strike just before the hour mark came after Toffees midfielder Andre Gomes inadvertently diverted the ball into his path from a corner.\nIt means the hosts have now gained 33 of their 43 points this calendar year at home.\nRicharlison, restored to the Everton line-up after appearing as a substitute at Burnley on Wednesday, twice went close to scoring for the visitors.\nBut home goalkeeper David Button saved well from point-blank range in the first half and pushed a shot on to the post in the second period.\nKurt Zouma's late header almost rescued a point for the visitors but he hit the crossbar as Brighton held on.\nThe result leaves Everton in 10th and Brighton 13th.\nBrighton well placed to survive with something to spare\nBrighton may no longer be top-flight novices but their primary aim at the start of this campaign will have been to retain their Premier League status.\nOn this evidence they are well placed to do that, and to surpass their achievements from last season when they finished on 40 points in 15th position.\nThis hard-fought victory ensured the Seagulls are four points better off than at the same stage a year ago and can boast a better goal difference.\nManager Chris Hughton will also be delighted with an 11-point cushion to the relegation zone, especially given their formidable home record.\nWhile they were hanging on in the closing stages against Everton, their resilience at the Amex was epitomised by the central defensive pairing of Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy as well as the performance of stand-in goalkeeper David Button.\nDunk played a captain's role, cajoling his team-mates to maintain their effort, and Duffy made more than double the number of clearances (11) of any other player on the park.\nIn Button, featuring because Mat Ryan was absent on international duty with Australia, they also had the game's outstanding performer, with the goalkeeper twice superbly repelling efforts from Richarlison that could have turned the contest.\nPredictably unpredictable Everton\nEverton's biggest problem is that you are never quite sure which face Marco Silva's side will display.\nHaving being thrashed 6-2 by Spurs before Christmas, Silva's side then produced a wonderful attacking display to deliver a thumping 5-1 victory at Burnley on Boxing Day.\nThis performance saw them revert to something rather less than wonderful, their passing often too one-paced to outfox the well-drilled hosts.\nWhile Silva attempted to retrieve a point by introducing Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Oumar Niasse to support Theo Walcott and Richarlison, the visitors' forward line shared the same attributes - pace and movement but little physical presence.\nRicharlison may have a creditable return of nine goals from 18 league games this season but this was one of those days when they missed the presence of a prolific centre-forward - an issue since Romelu Lukaku's departure to Manchester United in 2017.\nThe Brazil forward twice went close but he did so coming in from wider positions, away from Duffy and Dunk who dominated the central areas.\nAnd he stayed on the periphery throughout, managing just 33 touches in total.\nMan of the match - David Button (Brighton)\n'It's been a good year' - What they said\nBrighton manager Chris Houghton speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were holding on a bit at the end - they went to a 4-2-4 with real quality up front. But I thought we were good value for our win against a team in very good form.\n\"We wanted start this well in other matches, and sometimes a bit of fear sets in against the big teams. Generally at home we are good and start well. That lifted the crowd, and the players had the confidence to go through the game. We had good enough passages throughout to win the game.\n\"For all David Button's experience it is not easy for a keeper to just step in. Mat Ryan has been good for us. Button was excellent today. You train as hard as he does, when you step into a match you're going to play well.\n\"Locadia had a bit of fortune, but he was in the right place. He is used to scoring goals and had to wait a while.\n\"It has been a good year on the back of two good performances against two good teams. It puts us in good stead.\"\nEverton manager Marco Silva speaking to BBC Sport:\n\"It wasn't out best performance. Tough match - we expected that. They do well at home, they take most of their points here and we knew that.\n\"If you look through and analyse the match we had the best chances to score. In one moment one deflection gave them a chance to score. But we had the most chances to score.\n\"It is something we don't want. We had a good run in our performance and in our results. Now we are in a different moment, we have to react. The result was not fair but that's football. Now we have to prepare for the next game.\n\"What I spoke with the referee at the end and maybe the reason the players were angry in that moment is the referee has to control the game. It was a difficult match for both teams. It was really really difficult for the referee. We as a team have conditions to do better - I think the referee has too, but that's football. It wasn't a good game to see.\"\nEverton's south coast blues - the stats\nBrighton have lost only two of their past 13 Premier League home games (W6 D5), scoring at least once in each fixture.\nEverton are without a win in their past eight Premier League away games against south coast teams (D3 L5), since a 3-0 victory against Southampton in August 2015.\nThis was Brighton manager Chris Hughton's first Premier League win against Everton since February 2013 (2-1 in charge of Norwich).\nBrighton kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League since October (1-0 v Wolves), ending a run of nine consecutive games without one.\nEverton have not won back-to-back away games in the Premier League since September 2016 (under Ronald Koeman).\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has conceded 15 goals in the Premier League in December, as many as he had in August, September, October and November of this season combined (15).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton resume Premier League action on Wednesday 2 January at West Ham (19:45 GMT). Everton welcome Leicester City to Goodison Park a day earlier, on Tuesday 1 January (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-1 Chelsea: N'Golo Kante's goal sees off poor Eagles\nChelsea increased the gap between themselves and fifth-placed Arsenal to five points as N'Golo Kante's second-half strike earned them victory at Crystal Palace.\nKante scored the only goal of the game in the 51st minute when he broke forward from midfield to convert David Luiz's throughball.\nThere were few clear-cut chances as the Blues dominated possession and Palace sat back hoping to catch the opposition on the counter-attack - a tactic which failed to work as Roy Hodgson's Eagles took 85 minutes to register their first effort. That is now two successive games without a goal.\nChelsea's Willian came close to scoring with a free-kick that struck the post, and Ross Barkley also hit the woodwork with a hooked effort.\nFourth-placed Blues now have 43 points, one behind City and two behind Spurs. Palace remain in 14th with 19 points.\nQuiz: Name top goalscorers of 2018 in the Premier League\nReassigned Kante sees off Eagles\nThe Kante of 2018-19 is made up of different spec to previous models. Gone is the role of anchor man in midfield - the ball-winner who would allow other midfielders to make forays into the opposition's final third.\nThe remodelled version has been given permission to burst forward from the right of a midfield trio. During a largely nondescript opening 45 minutes, he made two runs into the Palace box - the first resulting in a strike that missed Vicente Guaita's far post by two feet.\nSarri's perseverance with the tactic paid off six minutes after the break when Kante grabbed his third goal of the season after again breaking from midfield.\nThis time it was defender Luiz the provider, with a threaded pass that found the Frenchman whose shot had enough power to beat the hand of the former Valencia keeper.\nWillian also went close for the Blues with a free-kick that came off the Palace post, while fellow midfielder Barkley hooked a shot from close range that grazed the woodwork.\nIt was a competent if unremarkable display from Sarri's side, but they did not have to break sweat against a lifeless Palace attack.\n'We had to keep it tight and hope to nick an undeserved point'\nThis was an utterly forgettable display by Palace.\nThey defended admirably but appeared to show little desire to put pressure on the opposition backline.\nTheir first effort on goal came in the 85th minute when Wilfried Zaha fired wide and high, before substitute Connor Wickham's strike from six yards resulted in a similar outcome.\nHodgson grimaced from the sidelines, as must have the Palace supporters inside Selhurst Park.\nHodgson wants to sign Liverpool striker Solanke\nThe former England manager explained that his side stuck to their defensive tactics after Chelsea scored because of the risk of \"conceding another three or four\".\n\"I thought we worked as hard as we could have,\" he said. \"We kept them in front of us and they had the ball, but they were creating goal chances.\n\"When they scored we had two options; either fly at it and risk conceding another three or four, or keep it tight and try and win an undeserved point in the last 15 minutes.\"\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante (Chelsea)\n'Kante is improving and now we must work on Barkley' - reaction\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a difficult match. I am happy with the team because we dominated for 85 minutes, although we didn't kill the match, so we had to fight again for the last five minutes.\"\nOn Kante's goal: \"He is improving with the right timing and good movement and now I think that we have to work on Ross Barkley. We now need continuity because in the last five matches we played very well in three, and badly in two, so now is the moment to have continuity.\n\"We have to play 19 matches, so other team's results are not important but it is crucial to have continuity. In two days we have had four injuries, with Cesc Fabregas, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Danny Drinkwater, and then today Olivier Giroud. We will have to see how long he is out for.\"\nAnother good away day with Sarri - the stats\nChelsea picked up their first win in an away league London derby since August 2017 (2-1 v Spurs), ending a run of five without victory (L3, D2).\nPalace failed to record a single shot on target in a Premier League home game for the first time since March 2017 v Watford.\nChelsea have won three consecutive Premier League away games for the first time under Sarri, last doing so in April under Antonio Conte.\nOnly Tottenham (nine) and Liverpool (eight) have won more away Premier League games this season than Chelsea (seven).\nKante scored his third league goal of the season - his best-ever return in a single campaign in the top five European leagues.\nEden Hazard created more goalscoring chances than any other player in this match (three) and as a result surpassed 100 chances created in the Premier League in 2018 (101); which is 23 more than any other player in the competition this calendar year.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea are at home to Southampton and Palace are at Wolves - both matches are on Wednesday and kick off at 19:45 GMT."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-3 Man City: City cut gap on league leaders\nManchester City survived a brief scare to beat Southampton and reduce league leaders Liverpool's advantage to seven points.\nSouthampton responded to David Silva's early opener when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg took the ball off Oleksandr Zinchenko and fired it into the top corner.\nCity had luck on their side when Raheem Sterling's shot deflected off James Ward-Prowse to make it 2-1.\nSergio Aguero's back-post header completed the scoring before half-time.\nSouthampton goalscorer Hojbjerg - who had only just returned from suspension - was shown a straight red card for a lunging tackle on Fernandinho with just over five minutes to go.\nCity had a number of decent chances as Silva, Aguero and Riyad Mahrez all went close in the first half and Aguero smacked the crossbar after the break.\nSouthampton threatened too and Charlie Austin was twice denied by City keeper Ederson in the first half before Hojbjerg's equaliser.\nBut the Saints were ultimately undone by Pep Guardiola's free-flowing side, who move up to second place in the table.\nLiverpool could be best team in the world at present - Guardiola\nHow has 2018 been for each Premier League team?\nQuiz: Name top goalscorers of 2018 in the Premier League\nCity respond to Liverpool's challenge\nLiverpool went 10 points clear of City at the top of the table with a devastating 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal on Saturday, meaning the defending champions needed victory to keep pace in the title race.\nCity appeared to feel the pressure on Boxing Day when they squandered an early lead and allowed Leicester to win 2-1 at the King Power Stadium.\nBut they stood up to the challenge at St Mary's - peppering Southampton's goal from the off and responding to the equaliser with two quick goals on the stroke of half-time.\nCity's opening goal was straight from Guardiola's textbook: Bernardo Silva's neat build-up down the right and cut-back into the centre was comfortably put away by an unmarked David Silva.\nSterling's shot was then deflected by Ward-Prowse and flapped into the net by Alex McCarthy to make it 2-1 before Aguero headed in Zinchenko's cross at the back post with ease.\nIt means City can cut Liverpool's lead to four points when the two teams meet at the Etihad Stadium on 3 January.\nImprovement for Saints\nThe last time Southampton played City in early November they were hammered 6-1 and failed to respond to three early goals.\nBut this time Southampton posed a threat and came close to breaking down a slightly nervy City defence on occasions.\nAustin's header at the near post was well saved by Ederson in the first half and that came moments after the keeper had avoided Hojbjerg's sliding tackle on the goal-line.\nAnd Saints' pressing paid off when Hojbjerg robbed Zinchenko of the ball in the build-up to his equaliser.\nCity could not extend their lead in the second half but Southampton's good work was only undone by the late sending-off of Hojbjerg.\nA trip to Stamford Bridge is a difficult start to the new year but the Saints will likely avoid the drop if they can produce performances like this in the second half of the season.\n'The worst thing happened' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"The first 15-20 minutes we were not very good but we smelt a bit of sensation when we equalised. We saw that Man City is not that confident in the moment like they are when they win week after week. We tried to push ourselves back into the game and press a little bit earlier but we saw when they have time to turn they are dangerous.\n\"At half time we thought about preparing the guys for a good second half but in the mind was also the next game against Chelsea. And then the worst thing happened in the red card for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg which is disappointing because he is one of the most important players in our team.\n\"In a game which is 3-1 and with only five minutes to go, you have to ask the use of such a tackle. He knows it was the wrong decision but it doesn't help us in the moment.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It was important to win after two defeats and the players did what they had to do. If one team achieves 100 points and then the year after make 45 in the first round it is not all bad.\n\"Before 1-1 we played to score more, then they scored and the game was more equal but we carried on and scored the second goal. In previous games we did everything, and the first time the opponent arrived in our half they scored.\"\nAguero reaches 50 under Pep - the best of the stats\nManchester City have won five consecutive Premier League games against Southampton for the first time.\nSouthampton have lost back-to-back Premier League home matches for the first time since September 2017, under Mauricio Pellegrino.\nCity have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 10 competitive matches - their longest streak since a run of 10 ending in February 2015.\nDavid Silva has scored against Southampton both home and away in this Premier League season - the sixth time he's achieved this feat against a single side in the competition.\nBernardo Silva has been directly involved in 10 goals in 19 Premier League games this season (5 goals, 5 assists), equalling his total in 2017-18 in 35 games (6 goals, 4 assists).\nSouthampton's starting XI had an average age of 24 years and 274 days; their youngest in a Premier League match for five years (Dec 2013 against Newcastle).\nAguero has scored 50 Premier League goals under Pep Guardiola, 16 more than any other player has for the club under the Spaniard.\nHojbjerg is the first Danish player to both score and be sent off in a single Premier League game, while he's the third Saints player to do this after Sadio Mane (v Liverpool in Oct 2015) and Peter Crouch (v Crystal Palace in May 2005).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to Stamford Bridge to take on Chelsea on Wednesday, 2 January (19:45 GMT), while Manchester City host league leaders Liverpool at the Etihad on Thursday, 3 January (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-0 West Ham United: Clarets end losing streak with comfortable win\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche says a couple of \"big decisions\" in his team selection contributed to a vital win over West Ham at Turf Moor.\nGoalkeeper Tom Heaton excelled after being recalled at the expense of Joe Hart and 19-year-old Dwight McNeil, also included as one of five changes to the side thumped 5-1 by Everton on Boxing Day, scored the Clarets' second goal.\n\"Joe has been magnificent for us and credit to him because he was the first to jump up at the end when Tom makes a big save,\" said Dyche, who had seen his side lose their previous three league matches.\n\"I decided the time was right for Dwight, who is a clever player who has some quality and ability. His family should take some pride in what he's doing. He'll get stronger and fitter and we hope he'll continue growing with the team.\"\nChris Wood put Burnley in charge with a right-footed finish from the left of the penalty area to conclude a sweeping move involving Heaton, Ashley Westwood, McNeil and Ashley Barnes.\nAnd with the hosts repeatedly carving through the visitors, they pressed home their advantage before the interval, when 19-year-old McNeil turned in Westwood's cross at the far post.\nIt was a disappointing end to a strong December for West Ham, who arrived in Lancashire on the back of five wins from six games.\nDespite the return of Marko Arnautovic, playing for the first time since injuring his hamstring at Cardiff on 4 December, Manuel Pellegrini's side were sluggish throughout with their best chance, a header from substitute Andy Carroll, drawing a fine save from Heaton late on.\nThe only crumb of comfort for the Hammers was that both Wood and Barnes spurned several excellent opportunities after the break to make Burnley's win more emphatic.\nThe win lifts Burnley above Fulham into 18th and level on points with 17th-placed Southampton, who lost to Manchester City.\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League games\nDyche returns to tried and tested formula\nA run of six defeats from their last seven games has raised question marks over Dyche's position for the first time in his six-year tenure.\nWhile the club finished seventh in the Premier League last season, that success was largely built on a solid defensive base. In contrast, the defence has been porous this term - leaking 41 goals so far, two more than the entire 2017-18 campaign.\nAnd with failed attempts to combat that problem including the deployment of five defenders in their last three matches - all ending in defeats - Dyche reverted to type with a 4-4-2 formation.\nWood and Barnes offered physicality in a two-man attack and club captain Heaton's return to the line-up proved inspired.\nOver 15 months had elapsed since Heaton dislocated his shoulder at Crystal Palace - the last time he featured in a league game for Burnley - but the 32-year-old exerted his influence on those in front of him, barking out instructions and providing organisation and leadership.\nThat contributed to West Ham managing just four shots on target and Heaton's understanding with his team-mates was evident as he raced out of his goal in the 15th minute to instigate the move that ended with Wood's goal.\nHeaton positioned himself to calmly head the ball to Westwood under pressure from West Ham attackers, and he underscored a good day's work by superbly tipping Carroll's header on to the woodwork late on.\nHammers toil as Anderson fails to shine\nA position just outside the top six felt like an implausible proposition for West Ham after they lost their opening four games but Pellegrini's side had the opportunity to move up to seventh at kick-off.\nInstead this turned into a second blip in an otherwise fruitful December, their other defeat this month, against Watford, also a 2-0 reverse.\n\"It was frustrating because we wanted to win this game and had the chance to be seventh but we lacked energy to win it,\" Pellegrini said.\n\"We had a flight that arrived at 2am in the morning after playing Southampton. I was happy until two o'clock today. This was a game we were able to win - Burnley was in a bad moment but they played with intensity. Burnley recovered better because they had 30 or 35 hours' more [rest].\"\nBrazilian midfielder Felipe Anderson has played a principal role in West Ham's upturn but he struggled to make an impact against well-drilled and determined opponents.\nAnderson won just 31% of his duels and his passing accuracy was also below par at 64%. And with West Ham's most creative player on the periphery it allowed Burnley to assume control.\nAnderson was far from the only visiting player to underwhelm, though. Lucas Perez and Robert Snodgrass were withdrawn at half-time after ineffective displays, which contributed to the visitors managing just one shot in the first period.\nThe introduction of Carroll did add power and presence but the Hammers were unable to provide the aerial service he thrives on until the closing minutes.\nMan of the match - Ashley Westwood (Burnley)\nWood's hot streak against Hammers - the stats\nBurnley have won two of their last three home league games, more than they had in their previous 10 at Turf Moor (W1 D2 L7).\nWest Ham have lost two of their last three Premier League games (W1), more than they had in their previous eight in the competition (W5 D2 L1).\nBurnley's Tom Heaton kept a clean sheet on his first Premier League start in 476 days, last starting in the competition in September 2017 against Crystal Palace.\nAged 19 years and 38 days, Dwight McNeil became the first ever teenager to score a Premier League goal for Burnley.\nBurnley striker Chris Wood has scored in all four of his Premier League appearances against West Ham, netting five goals in total.\nWood's five Premier League goals against West Ham account for 38% of his total strikes in the competition (5/13).\nSecond-half substitute Andy Carroll was responsible for 45% of West Ham's total shots in this match (5/11).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to face fellow strugglers Huddersfield on Wednesday, 2 January (19:45 GMT) while West Ham host Brighton at the London Stadium on the same evening (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Man Utd 4-1 Bournemouth: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says he is not purely focused on attack\nCaretaker boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he is not solely focused on \"attacking football\" after Manchester United scored their 12th goal in three games as they swept aside Bournemouth.\nA cavalier display in the first half at Old Trafford saw United score three times, with Paul Pogba netting his second double in successive matches and Marcus Rashford grabbing the other.\nSolskjaer's side conceded their third goal in as many games when Nathan Ake headed in before substitute Romelu Lukaku fired home a fourth.\nUnited, in sixth, are now only three points behind fifth-placed Arsenal, having trailed by eight following the morale-sapping 3-1 defeat at Liverpool earlier this month.\n\"Everyone thinks I'm looking for attacking football all the time,\" said Solskjaer.\n\"But the foundation is how you defend - keep a clean sheet and you have a decent chance to win a game of football.\n\"Training sessions have been high quality. The tempo and sharpness has been really good, but we will get better and we are working towards a clean sheet.\"\nQuiz: Name top goalscorers of 2018 in the Premier League\nReaction from Old Trafford\nPogba poked in his first after Rashford had mesmerised both Ake and Diego Rico on the right, before the French World Cup winner headed in from Ander Herrera's precise delivery.\nIt was 3-0 when Anthony Martial, back in the XI after recovering from a bug, provided a wonderful cross for Rashford to slide his shot past Asmir Begovic.\nBournemouth, who had looked dangerous on set-pieces, pulled a goal back in first-half stoppage-time when Ake headed in following good work by David Brooks.\nLukaku scored United's fourth from Pogba's pass two minutes after coming on, before defender Eric Bailly was shown a straight red card for scything down Cherries midfielder Ryan Fraser.\nThis victory means Solskjaer has emulated Sir Matt Busby and Jose Mourinho by winning his first three league games in charge.\nThe Norwegian will be looking to make it four at Newcastle on Wednesday, while Bournemouth remain 12th in the Premier League.\nUnited rediscover old swagger\nThe loss at Anfield on 16 December seems like an age ago. On that day United's players trudged off the field having been overwhelmed by their arch-rivals.\nSince Solskjaer replaced Mourinho, the Red Devils have reverted to type, playing a style familiar to those who watched attack-minded teams sweep to 13 league titles under Sir Alex Ferguson.\nThey are not at that level but the watching Ferguson, who turns 77 on Monday, would have been impressed with the way United went about opening up the Cherries' defence from the first whistle.\nPogba and Rashford led the charge. The first goal was all about the Englishman's trickery on the right, as he left both Ake and Rico trailing before striking a low cross which was turned in by Pogba.\nPogba's second was reminiscent of goals scored by former United captain Bryan Robson, as he arrived late to power home a cross from Herrera.\nRashford's strike from close range should have capped off a perfect half of football for United, but Ake's header kept the second half interesting.\nUnited continued to drive at Eddie Howe's side after the break but Lukaku's strike, with his weaker right foot, was the only goal they managed for their efforts.\nPogba was denied his hat-trick by a brilliant Begovic save and the post, and the Bosnian keeper also rushed out to block Rashford's shot.\nUnited only took their foot off the accelerator when Bailly received his third red card while playing for club, 11 minutes from time. The Cherries might argue that Ashley Young should have also been sent off for the reckless manner in which he won the ball from Joshua King in the first half.\nNine goals conceded in two games, but Cherries can take positives\nIt has been a tough post-Christmas period for Bournemouth so far. A 5-0 thumping at Tottenham on 26 December and now this heavy defeat at Old Trafford, coupled with the long-term injury to Simon Francis, has the Cherries looking for solace.\nHowever, they provided enough of an indication on Sunday that better might be forthcoming when they host Watford on Wednesday.\nNorway striker King looked a threat throughout, with one shot blocked by Bailly, while David de Gea produced a good save to prevent him from bursting the net.\nDefender Ake was also a nuisance for United's defence. Aside from his goal, he produced another goal-bound header which came off the arm of De Gea.\nThe backline needs working on but Howe's side carries enough of an attacking threat to get them back on track.\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\n'The next few games will be important' - reaction\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It was disappointing technically and defensively, but I think we have to look at ourselves and think we could have got more from the game.\n\"We have had a difficult run of games and had some injuries, and maybe we have had a loss of confidence because of that. But we won't make excuses and we have to work hard to turn it around.\n\"Ultimately, I still believe we are a good team but we are in a difficult moment so these next few games are going to be very important.\"\nPogba continues to shine under Solskjaer - the stats\nUnited have recorded three consecutive Premier League victories for the first time since a run of five in April.\nAfter losing their first league clash with Bournemouth in December 2015, United are unbeaten in each of the past seven Premier League games against them (W6 D1).\nNo side have kept fewer clean sheets in the Premier League this season than United (two, also Fulham).\nRashford has provided six assists in 17 Premier League appearances this season; as many as in his previous two seasons combined (77 appearances).\nPogba has scored four goals in his three Premier League appearances under Solskjaer, as many as he had in his previous 20 under Mourinho.\nPogba is the first United player to score at least twice in consecutive Premier League appearances since Wayne Rooney in December 2012.\nWith four goals and three assists, December 2018 has been Pogba's best month for goal involvements in his top-flight career.\nLukaku has scored eight goals in seven Premier League games against Bournemouth - only against West Ham (nine) has he scored more in the competition.\nAfter just four goal involvements in his first 15 Premier League appearances, Bournemouth's Brooks has been involved in three in his past three (two goals, one assist).\nWhat's next?\nUnited travel to Newcastle on Wednesday (20:00 GMT) and Bournemouth are at home to Watford on the same day (19:45 GMT)."

When you do that it is impossible to get the creativity and the mobility to create chances to score.\n\"We didn't create much in the first half. But every time we won the ball in the good positions it wasn't good enough. A lot of easy mistakes and missing easy passes.\"\nVardy's 58th-minute goal was one of the few highlights of a turgid affair.\nFull-back Ricardo Pereira capitalised on defender Michael Keane's error to play in the England striker, who finished with an angled drive past Jordan Pickford.\nEverton were not much of a force in attack, with Jonjoe Kenny's first-half shot off the bar the closest they came to scoring.\nThe Toffees, who have not won in their past four home games, remain 10th in the table, while Leicester move above Wolves into seventh.\nDefeat caps miserable Christmas for Everton\nEverton spent more than \u00a3200m on players in two summer transfer windows, but some fans will be wondering where their quality signings have been hiding in recent games.\nA 5-1 win at Burnley was the only highlight of a rotten festive period in which they have conceded 12 goals in five games and failed to score in their past two.\nLeicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel was tested only twice, by substitute Cenk Tosun on both occasions. The first was a firm 20-yard strike which he punched clear before the Dane reacted to push away a close-range header late on.\nIt was a mistake by \u00a330m signing Michael Keane, who failed to control a Leicester long ball, which resulted in the decisive goal.\nHe and the rest of the Everton players will hope to avoid another slip-up when they host League Two side Lincoln City in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.\nVardy class proves the difference\nIn contrast to Silva, Leicester manager Claude Puel has had a wonderful festive period.\nThat is now three wins in four games for the Foxes, with those victories coming against Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton.\nThose were the type of sides the Foxes were beating during their title-winning season in 2015-16.\nThey lack the consistency of that campaign and have lost some key players since, but one standout act from that season has remained and he once again made the difference.\nVardy had only one shot on target in the match, but he made it count. It was one of his typical finishes, running on to a through ball before striking home left-footed from an angle.\nThe celebration was less typical - a cartwheel and a somersault.\nPoor advert for the Premier League\nThe first 15 minutes of a forgettable first half were farcical. Two teams, laden with millions of pounds of talent, could barely hold on to possession for more than a few seconds.\nThe graphic below illustrates the misplaced passes during that period. Everton's Kenny was the worst culprit of the 20 outfield players - he attempted 14 passes, with an accuracy of only 35.7%.\nLeicester defender Ben Chilwell lost possession 22 times in the first 45 minutes, having only done so on 17 occasions in the entire match against Cardiff three days ago.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\n'We showed our strength' - reaction\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"The organisation of the team was perfect and I am happy for the players because we lost our last game at home to Cardiff and it was not a fair result.\n\"We said after that game we wanted to take three points away. It was a difficult challenge but the team showed character.\n\"We know all the players are tired but the most important thing was to show our strength in this moment. We needed to have a different adaptation for this game.\n\"In this situation it is not just the quality, but the physical makes a difference.\"\nFoxes are New Year's Day specialists - stats\nLeicester have won three of their past four Premier League matches (L1) - one more than in their previous 10 combined.\nEverton have lost four of their past five Premier League games (W1) - as many as they lost in their first 16 matches of the 2018-19 season (W6 D6 L4).\nSince Puel's first league match in charge in October 2017, Vardy has scored 22 goals in the competition under the Frenchman - double any other player.\nLeicester have won five of their past six league matches played on New Year's Day (D1).\nVardy has been involved in seven goals against Everton in the Premier League (5 goals, 2 assists) - only against Liverpool (8) has he been involved in more.\nEverton have lost three of their past five home games against Leicester in all competitions (W2) - as many as in their previous 24 meetings at Goodison Park.\nWhat's next?\nEverton are at home to Lincoln City in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Leicester travel to Newport County on Sunday (16:30)."

Above all we know Fulham midfielder Jean Michael Seri is coming on and we need a player close to him, not to let him play easily with the ball.\n\"Ramsey can do that and also help us in attack, and he scored. The reason is this. I need to do my work. And not maybe because every supporter can have a different opinion, tactically.\"\nThe Gunners suffered their heaviest defeat of the season on Saturday when they lost 5-1 at Anfield, but goals from Granit Xhaka, Lacazette, Ramsey and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang helped them to only their second win in six games.\nAfter Ryan Sessegnon had missed two good chances for Fulham, Xhaka put the hosts ahead, finishing past Sergio Rico after a good cross from the impressive Alex Iwobi.\nLacazette doubled the lead when he finished off Sead Kolasinac's pull-back following a fine Arsenal passing move.\nKamara pulled one back from close range, but Ramsey scored the Gunners' third after Aubameyang had hit the post.\nAubameyang's deflected shot gave Arsenal their fourth and a deserved three points.\nRelive Arsenal's win over Fulham as it happened\nAnother goal for Aubameyang, but defensive worries continue\nIt had been a poor festive season for Arsenal as they only managed a 1-1 draw at Brighton on 26 December before their thrashing at Anfield.\nThe Gunners were again without Mesut Ozil, with the German still sidelined with the knee injury that kept him out of the Liverpool match, while Ramsey, out of contract in the summer and a transfer target for Bayern Munich, Inter Milan, Juventus, Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid, was only among the substitutes.\nNevertheless, the hosts took a 25th-minute lead when Xhaka finished from Iwobi's cross and they ended the first half strongly with chances for Matteo Guendouzi, Xhaka and Aubameyang.\nA wonderful passing move down the left wing after 10 minutes of the second half, involving Iwobi, Kolasinac and Lacazette, led to the Gunners' second as the Frenchman scored his seventh Premier League goal of the campaign.\nFulham pulled one back but Ramsey, who had only been on the pitch for four minutes, scored Arsenal's third after Aubameyang's effort had hit the post, before the Gabon striker added a fourth late on after a pass from Sokratis to score his 14th league goal of the season.\nArsenal started the game with three centre-halves - Laurent Koscielny, Sokratis and Shkodran Mustafi - but were lucky not to fall behind as Sessegnon twice missed good chances when it was goalless.\nThe Gunners changed to a back four at half-time but Fulham still created opportunities and Kamara's goal means Arsenal have not kept a clean sheet in six games in all competitions and have only stopped the opposition from scoring in three of 21 Premier League games in 2018-19.\nKamara back in Ranieri's good books\nArsenal's defensive problems do not compare to those of Claudio Ranieri's side, though. The Cottagers have now conceded 47 goals in 21 games, six more than any other side in the top flight.\nFulham had an early warning as Aubameyang missed a chance in only the second minute before Sessegnon should have given the visitors the lead but shot wide when he only had Bernd Leno to beat and then missed his kick from six yards out from Andre Schurrle's inviting cross.\nThose misses proved costly as Xhaka was given too much space in the penalty area - escaping marker Tim Ream to finish past Sergio Rico and put the hosts in front.\nRanieri's team still had chances, but were again poor at the back as they were sliced apart with a beautifully-crafted goal from Lacazette after a fine passing move down the left wing.\nBut for all their defensive problems, Fulham were still creating opportunities and Mitrovic, who had earlier had a header saved on the line by Bernd Leno, was again denied by the German, before substitute Kamara tapped in from Sessegnon's cross.\nIn Fulham's previous match against Huddersfield, the Cottagers were awarded a penalty and Kamara grabbed the ball off normal penalty taker Mitrovic before seeing his effort saved by Terriers' goalkeeper Jonas Lossl.\nFulham still won that game 1-0, thanks to Mitrovic's late injury-time winner, but it did not stop manager Ranieri saying he \"wanted to kill\" the French forward after that match.\n\"Abou is a good boy. I said the matter was finished - he apologised to everybody,\" added the Italian after Tuesday's game.\nKamara's goal made it 2-1 to Arsenal, but any hopes of a Fulham fightback were quickly ended with two more Arsenal goals in a four-minute spell late on.\nRanieri's poor run against Arsenal continues - the stats\nArsenal have scored 10 Premier League goals this season courtesy of substitutes, more than any other team.\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri has never won a Premier League match against Arsenal in 11 attempts (drew four, lost seven) and has a worse points-per-game ratio against the Gunners (0.36) than he does versus any other opponent in the competition.\nArsenal have kept just one clean sheet in their last 14 Premier League games.\nGranit Xhaka has scored three Premier League goals in 20 appearances for Arsenal in 2018-19 - as many as in his previous two seasons combined (3 in 70 games).\nArsenal's Alex Iwobi has been directly involved in three goals in his last four Premier League appearances (1 goal, 2 assists), as many as in his previous 16 in the competition.\nThree of Alexandre Lacazette's seven Premier League goals for Arsenal this season have come against Fulham.\nSince the start of last season, Ryan Sessegnon has been directly involved in 31 league goals (including play-offs) for Fulham (18 goals, 13 assists), eight more than any other player for the club.\nArsenal defender Sokratis registered an assist for the first time in his last 120 games in Europe's big five leagues, since 12 April 2014 (Borussia Dortmund v Bayern Munich).\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal)\n'We don't have the quality of Arsenal' - what they said\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"We wanted to win and this result will give confidence. We continued to push and create chances and we can be happy.\n\"It is normal for the fans to have some doubt at 2-1, but the team continued to do their work and played our planned game. I thought we deserved the scoreline. We scored with different players and we can continue to build our identity with the players.\"\nOn whether the club will be active in the transfer market: \"It depends if the transfer market can help you - only if there are players who can help us in different positions. The club is looking to see.\"\nFulham boss Claudio Ranieri, speaking to Sky Sports: \"If you analyse the first half hour we created two great chances. The home crowd thought, 'what happened' and started to boo their players.\n\"But then Arsenal scored with their first chance because of our mistake and then we made another mistake and they scored. But we were back at 2-1 but then made more mistakes.\n\"We then got a little tired and we don't have the quality of Arsenal. It was not bad our performance.\"\nOn any potential signings in January: \"Maybe it's something we have to do - I will speak to the owner.\n\"I'm very, very pleased with my players. If we have the chance to buy some good players then welcome.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides' next matches come in the third round of the FA Cup with Arsenal at League One side Blackpool on Saturday, 5 January (17:30 GMT), before Fulham entertain League Two outfit Oldham Athletic the following day (14:00 GMT).\nTheir next Premier League games come on 12 January, with Arsenal away at West Ham, and Fulham at fellow strugglers Burnley."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 0-3 Tottenham: Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min score in win\nTottenham need to be consistent if they want to be Premier League title contenders, says manager Mauricio Pochettino after his side strolled to a 3-0 win at Cardiff to climb back up to second.\nSpurs fell to a shock 3-1 home defeat by Wolves on Saturday but ruthlessly exposed Cardiff's flimsy defence with three goals before half-time on Tuesday.\nHarry Kane bundled in a fortuitous early opener in the third minute and Christian Eriksen nestled a fine strike into the bottom corner nine minutes later.\nSon Heung-min added a third in the 26th minute and, from that point, the untroubled visitors seemed to ease off a little.\nCardiff at least registered their first efforts on target in a low-key second half but the damage had already been done and they remain 16th in the table, three points clear of the relegation zone.\nBy contrast, a sixth victory from seven league matches narrows the gap between Spurs and leaders Liverpool to six points, with the Reds away at third-placed Manchester City on Thursday.\n\"We were so relaxed and kept calm, it was so important. We showed Wolves was just an accident,\" Pochettino said.\n\"It's a crazy fixture list - it's normal that in some games we can drop our mental energy.\n\"The most important thing is to find a way to be consistent if we want to be contenders. We need to believe more in us. We are in a process of doing fantastic things.\"\nSpurs should be forced to play at Wembley until end of season - Warnock\nSpurs' title tilt back on track\nSuccessive thrashings of Everton and Bournemouth had added weight to the notion Spurs are genuine contenders to win the Premier League, even if Mauricio Pochettino had described his side as \"intruders\" in the title race.\nTheir growing sense of optimism was punctured by that loss to Wolves - but this display suggested it was a mere aberration.\nWhereas Wolves were disciplined and resolute, on this occasion Spurs were presented with a charitable Cardiff defence - which they punished clinically.\nThe opening goal arrived inside three minutes and in farcical fashion. Kane played the ball wide to Kieran Trippier, whose cross fell to Sean Morrison but the Cardiff defender only succeeded in playing the ball on to Kane's knee before it bobbled into the net.\nIt may have been a lucky strike for the England captain but it was also a significant one, as it meant he has now scored against all 28 of the Premier League teams he has faced.\nTottenham had countered swiftly and accurately to set up that opportunity, and it was a similar tale for their second goal as Son teed up Eriksen, who deftly shimmied into a shooting position before arrowing a low effort into the bottom corner.\nSon, who has been in sparkling form of late, then got in on the act as he received a pass from Kane and finished neatly from a tight angle.\nAt this point Spurs looked set to give Cardiff a hammering, but instead Pochettino's men showed a little mercy.\nAfter a congested festive period of fixtures, it may have been an attempt to conserve Spurs' energy, which is perhaps a wise approach with far tougher challenges to come.\n\"We suffered with four games in 10 days. I want to congratulate the players. I'm so pleased with the effort,\" Pochettino said.\n\"We felt disappointed [after the Wolves loss] and we wanted to show our energy from the beginning. After 20 minutes we showed how we wanted to play and were clinical.\n\"Today we showed great energy and maturity that we want. Now we need to keep that level and consistency throughout the season if we want to be there and fight for big things.\"\nCardiff's survival bid takes a hit\nIf Spurs travelled to south Wales still reeling from their loss against Wolves, Cardiff entered this match with morale arguably as high as it ever has been this season.\nVictor Camarasa's brilliant added-time winner at Leicester had given the Bluebirds their first away victory of the campaign in dramatic fashion on Saturday, ensuring they started 2019 three points clear of the relegation zone.\nHowever, they never looked like extending that cushion here.\nBefore this fixture, Cardiff had lost their previous 14 games against the Premier League's big six sides and conceded 45 goals in the process, 22 of which had come in their six defeats this season.\nIt was hardly a surprise, therefore, that the Bluebirds were cut to ribbons by Spurs.\nBut even with the visitors' might in mind, Neil Warnock was irritated by the submissive nature of the defending from his side, who had kept clean sheets in their previous matches against Leicester and Crystal Palace.\nWith Huddersfield the next visitors to Cardiff City Stadium on 12 January, Warnock will drum into his players the importance of that fixture to ensure there is no repeat.\n\"When we start off like that we shoot ourselves in the foot,\" he said.\n\"All the planning goes out of the window. The goals were disappointing but they were too good for us in the first half. But that's life and you move on.\n\"I was pleased we hung in there because it's easy to throw the towel in when you're 3-0 down to a team like this. Four points in three games over a difficult period is good really.\n\"We have had a great season so far. Players were told what they were doing and two or three let me down a little in that respect defensively today. We were playing for pride in the end.\"\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen\nSon's impressive streak - the best stats\nSpurs have won each of their four Premier League games against Cardiff - only Manchester City (seven v Bournemouth) and Arsenal (six v Reading) have a better 100% record against an opponent in the competition.\nSpurs are still to play out a draw in the Premier League this season (W16, D0, L5); just the ninth occasion in top-flight history that a team has gone 21 or more games into a season without drawing.\nCardiff have the same number of points this season (18) as they did after 21 games of their only previous Premier League campaign (18 in 2013-14), however they do have a worse goal difference this term (-22).\nCardiff have conceded 25 goals across their games against the 'big six' teams in the Premier League this season; the most of any side.\nNo player in Premier League history has scored more goals on New Year's Day than Tottenham's Harry Kane (five - a joint-high with Andrew Cole and Steven Gerrard).\nSon Heung-min has been directly involved in 11 goals in his last eight starts for Spurs in the Premier League, scoring eight and assisting another three.\nSpurs midfielder Christian Eriksen has scored 19 goals from outside the box in the Premier League; the most of any player in the competition since his debut (September 2013).\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are in FA Cup action - Tottenham travel to Tranmere Rovers on Friday, 4 January (19:45 GMT) while Cardiff are away at Gillingham a day later (15:00).\nTottenham then play Chelsea in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg on 8 January. Their next league game is against Manchester United on 13 January.\nCardiff's next league match is at home against relegation rivals Huddersfield on 12 January."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-0 Southampton: Blues boss Maurizio Sarri wants a new striker after goalless draw\nChelsea head coach Maurizio Sarri hinted at the need for a new striker after his side failed to break down a resolute Southampton team at Stamford Bridge.\nThe hosts had 72% of possession but could not find their way through a well-organised and disciplined Saints side as it ended goalless.\n\"I think we played a very good match for 80 metres of the pitch, then we were in trouble in the last 20 metres,\" said Sarri, who has Alvaro Morata as his only recognised striker with Olivier Giroud out with an ankle injury.\n\"We have to try to solve the problem of the last 15, 20 metres. The club knows very well my opinion. I think we need something different for characteristics.\n\"I'm not in charge of the market. I have to try to improve my players, my team, my offensive phase, or better my offensive phase in the last 20 metres.\n\"The club knows my position, my opinion. It's up to the board.\"\nSarri, who dismissed the prospect of recalling strikers Michy Batshuayi and Tammy Abraham from loan spells at Valencia and Aston Villa respectively, watched his side fail to score for the second successive home league game.\nFor Southampton, they kept their first clean sheet in 11 Premier League games, but still dropped into the bottom three as they fall below Burnley into 18th after the Clarets' 2-1 win at Huddersfield.\nChelsea's best chance fell to Eden Hazard, but his well-hit shot was saved by Premier League debutant Angus Gunn.\nMorata thought he had scored when he put the ball into the net midway through the second half, but it was ruled out as he was given offside.\nSouthampton offered little as an attacking force, with one Oriol Romeu shot easily saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nThe hosts wanted a late penalty as Marcos Alonso went to ground under a challenge from Shane Long, but referee Jonathan Moss was not interested in Chelsea's appeals.\nAnalysis and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nWillian injury on a frustrating night for Chelsea\nBefore the game, Sarri said the club \"was in trouble\" because of their injury problems and the fact they would have to play \"every three days\" in January.\nThose problems worsened in the first half as Willian, following a strong challenge from Maya Yoshida, limped off to be replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, himself only just returning to contention after a back injury.\nIt means the Brazilian joins Giroud (ankle), Pedro (hamstring) and Callum Hudson-Odoi (hamstring) as attacking options that are unavailable for the Blues, who could play as many as eight games this month.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Chelsea announced they have signed 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund forward Christian Pulisic for 64m euros (\u00a358m), although he will also not feature for the Blues in 2018-19 as he will be loaned back to the German club until the end of the season.\nThis performance shows why Sarri has opted to strengthen his squad as once again Morata failed to impress up front with the Spaniard failing to score for the seventh consecutive Premier League game.\nHe had a weak header easily saved after Cesar Azpilicueta's long ball forward and looked to have ended his goalless run but was denied by the assistant referee's flag as he was judged offside.\nThe draw means Chelsea are now 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who play their game in hand, away at Manchester City, on Thursday.\nHasenhuttl tightens up Saints' defence\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl opted to make eight changes to the side that began the 3-1 loss against Manchester City on Sunday, including a Premier League debut for 22-year-old goalkeeper Gunn, son of ex-Norwich goalkeeper Bryan.\nGunn did well to quickly come off his line and clear the danger on a couple of times in the first half and also denied Hazard, with the Belgian's powerful shot hitting him in the face.\nHasenhuttl had organised his team well and they proved hard to break down with a back five and at times five midfielders in front of them with Danny Ings and then his replacement Shane Long, sometimes operating as their lone striker, but often dropping back to help their team-mates further.\nThe tactics worked as the hosts could only manage two shots on target in the first half - Hazard's effort saved by Gunn and Morata's weak header.\nGunn, who cost the Saints \u00a310m in a summer move from Manchester City, was busier in the second half as he parried a Hazard effort, caught a rising Jorginho shot, held on to a Morata strike and denied Alonso in stoppage time.\nThe final whistle saw Hasenhuttl punch the air in celebration as his side picked up their seventh point in his six games in charge - including matches against three of the top five - Arsenal, Manchester City and now Chelsea.\nIt was also only the fifth time Southampton had stopped the opposition from scoring in 21 Premier League matches in 2018-19 and was their first clean sheet since 27 October when they drew 0-0 at home with Newcastle.\nMan of the match - Angus Gunn (Southampton)\n'We deserved a point' - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri told BBC Sport: \"We had four or five goal opportunities but sometimes if you want to have a lot of opportunities you have to score the first goal.\n\"We did not move the ball very well and we need to improve. We were playing without important players like Pedro, Willian after 30 minutes, Callum Hudson-Odoi was out. On the bench I only had one offensive player Loftus (Ruben Loftus-Cheek) and he is not very well at the moment with back trouble.\"\nOn the signing of Christian Pulisic, Sarri added: \"I didn't know anything about Christian Pulisic yesterday. The club asked my opinion about him one month ago and my opinion was positive and I knew the deal was done but I didn't know anything. I'm not in charge of the market.\n\"We have to play every three days so I cannot think of next year, I have to think about the next match.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport: \"I think it was very hard work against the ball. The guys were brave, sometimes pressing high, sometimes deeper. We didn't give so many chances away, they have fantastic quality and to defend every attack is not easy, but with our mentality we deserved a point.\n\"In the last 30 minutes you feel tired, we had to close the gaps and if you have guy like Eden Hazard dribbling at you, you need a lot of players near him to stop him.\n\"We made the right decision to change so many players against Manchester City to keep them fresh for today. I don't want to say we gave the Manchester City game away but we had more chances today. It was an amazing fight we gave.\"\nOn goalkeeper Gunn, who kept a clean sheet on his debut, Hasenhuttl added: \"The guy showed he is a very forward defensive goalkeeper. We knew about Chelsea's chipped balls forward and we told him to be brave. He made some good saves and I'm happy with him.\"\nAnother home blank for Chelsea - the stats\nSouthampton have only won four of their 20 visits to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League (drew six, lost 11), most recently a 3-1 win over Jose Mourinho's Blues in October 2015.\nChelsea have failed to score in three of their last five Premier League games at Stamford Bridge, as many as in their previous 22 in the competition.\nSouthampton have drawn nine Premier League games by a 0-0 scoreline since the start of last season; two more than any other side.\nSouthampton have recorded their first Premier League clean sheet since October, conceding 24 goals in their previous 10 before today.\nAt 22 years and 346 days, Southampton's Gunn is the youngest English goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet on his Premier League debut since Ben Amos for Manchester United against Stoke in January 2012 (21 years, 295 days).\nGunn (one) has recorded more Premier League clean sheets at Stamford Bridge than his father Bryan did (none in three attempts).\nMorata has recorded 1.9 offsides per game this season, the most of any player to have played at least 90 minutes.\nCesc Fabregas' appearance for Chelsea vs Southampton is his 500th for English club sides in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea entertain Championship side Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 5 January (15:00 GMT) and then face Tottenham away from home in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final on Tuesday, 8 January, before returning to league action on Saturday, 12 January when they play Newcastle.\nSouthampton play in the FA Cup at Derby on Saturday (15:00 GMT), before another trip to the East Midlands to face Leicester in the Premier League a week later."

        "article_text": "Wolves 0-2 Crystal Palace: Jordan Ayew and Luka Milivojevic earn Palace win\nCrystal Palace struck two late goals as Roy Hodgson's side edged further away from the Premier League relegation zone with victory over Wolves at Molineux.\nJordan Ayew put the visitors ahead with seven minutes remaining, producing a sublime touch to control Patrick van Aanholt's effort before converting from close range for his first goal for the club.\nLuka Milivojevic then made no mistake from the penalty spot deep into stoppage time after Wilfried Zaha was brought down by Ryan Bennett.\nThe visitors dictated the early play and captain Milivojevic's dipping effort from the edge of the area forced Rui Patricio into a fine save after Willy Boly had been robbed of possession by Andros Townsend.\nRaul Jimenez registered Wolves' first meaningful attempt - firing over from distance - before Matt Doherty missed the best chance of the first half as he headed over when left in space from a corner.\nPalace had an escape after the break as Doherty failed to connect with Ivan Cavaleiro's cross, having caught Aaron Wan Bissaka in possession, while at the other end Ayew failed to hit the target under pressure from Conor Coady.\nBut Crystal Palace's late show ensured they move six points clear of Southampton in 18th, while Wolves lost ground on Leicester.\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League matches\nDisciplined Palace find breakthrough\nSince Crystal Palace scored three times on their way to shocking Manchester City before Christmas, Hodgson's side's attacking shortcomings have again become evident.\nA goalless draw with Cardiff preceded a forgettable defeat by Chelsea - and up to the 83rd minute this appeared a familiar tale for the Eagles despite a dominant display.\nHodgson admitted an interest in loaning Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke to address his side's lack of goals, but a move was ruled out before kick-off over concerns about the 21-year-old's fitness.\nBut Ghana forward Ayew picked the perfect time for his first goal since joining from Swansea in the summer, producing a rare moment of quality with his first touch as Palace's late pressure was rewarded.\nDespite a disciplined performance and Milivojevic adding some gloss to the scoreline with 94 minutes played, the fact remains that only two sides have scored fewer goals than the Eagles in this campaign.\nNevertheless the table does offer some relief to Hodgson after a steady festive period - but a move for a striker in the transfer window still appears crucial if they are to make further progress in 2019.\nAnother home defeat for Wolves\nWolves were well off the pace against the Eagles as four matches in the space of 12 days appeared to take their toll on Nuno Espirito Santo's side.\nA memorable year for the club was fittingly capped by defeating title-hopefuls Tottenham in their final match of 2018, scoring three times in a pulsating final 18 minutes.\nThose late heroics masked the fact they failed to create chances in the first half against Spurs and they didn't ever get going against Palace in what is becoming a theme at home given this was their fifth defeat in seven games at Molineux.\nDoherty should have done better when Boly's misdirected header fell to the Republic of Ireland defender inside the six-yard box, but leading scorer Jimenez saw his opportunities restricted.\nIn fact they failed to register a shot on target until substitute Ruben Neves tried to find the bottom corner on 91 minutes and it was the visitors who found an incisive side in the final 10 minutes.\nMan of the match - Mamadou Sakho (Crystal Palace)\n'No excuses' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"I thought we were the team pushing for the goal and when we eventually got it I think we can say we deserved it.\n\"Jordan worked so hard and it was fitting he could score the goal that has eluded him and us for so long. I'm really pleased with the performance, the discipline and I'm delighted to win a game away from home because it makes the Christmas period quite a good one for us.\"\nPalace pull out of move for Dominic Solanke\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"The first half was very compact, both teams very organised but we didn't quite get in the game. We have to do better.\n\"There's no excuses. We didn't perform well. Palace had one day less [to prepare] than us - so there's no excuses.\"\nZaha delivers penalties - the stats\nWolves have lost five of their last seven Premier League home games after remaining unbeaten in their first four at Molineux this season.\nWolves managed just one shot on target, their joint-lowest tally in a Premier League game this season.\nCrystal Palace have won consecutive away Premier League games within the same season for the first time since April 2017.\nOnly Liverpool (12), Chelsea (10) and Tottenham (9) have kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Palace (8).\nJordan Ayew claimed his first Premier League goal since scoring for Swansea against Everton in April 2018.\nSince the start of last season, Palace's Wilfried Zaha has won eight Premier League penalties, two more than any other player.\n78% of Palace midfielder Luka Milivojevic's Premier League goals have been penalties (14/18) - the highest ratio among players with 15+ goals in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace host Grimsby Town in the FA Cup on Saturday (17:30 GMT) and Wolves welcome Liverpool to Molineux in the same competition on Monday (19:45)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-2 Brighton & Hove Albion: Arnautovic double rescues hosts\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini said he was \"absolutely frustrated\" despite Marko Arnautovic scoring twice in two minutes to salvage a point against Brighton.\nThe Seagulls took a 2-0 lead, also within the space of two minutes, with their eighth and ninth goals from corners this season.\n\"The most important way that Brighton scores is from set-pieces, and we allowed them to score two goals this way,\" said Pellegrini, whose side ended a run of the three consecutive defeats against their opponents.\n\"I don't remember any other chances for them, but we didn't create in the first 45 minutes.\"\nArnautovic, who has been linked with Chelsea, proved his value again for the Hammers by turning around a game which came to life after a drab first half where Andy Carroll made his first start in exactly a year.\nAfter Carroll was hooked at half-time, Dale Stephens rifled the visitors ahead from the edge of the box with his first Premier League goal.\nShortly afterwards, the Seagulls doubled their advantage when Shane Duffy peeled to the back post and controlled the ball on his chest before cleverly poking home.\nBut two Pellegrini substitutions unleashed their star striker as Mark Noble chipped a lovely ball forward which the Austrian striker hammered home from close range.\nThen Michail Antonio cut the ball back from as close to the byline as he could get for the 29-year-old to score his seventh goal of the season.\nThere were further chances for Antonio and Declan Rice to win it, but the point moved West Ham into the top half of the table.\nWhen the disappointment of throwing away a two-goal lead subsides, Brighton will take solace in remaining unbeaten in three games over the festive period as they remain 10 points clear of the relegation zone.\nArnautovic shines as Carroll disappoints\nMuch of the attention prior to the match centred on Carroll, who made his first start in a exactly a year - when he scored twice to help the Hammers beat West Brom 2-1 - to freshen up his team.\nBut after only six appearances off the bench this season, the former Liverpool and Newcastle striker looked rusty as he miscontrolled the ball on several occasions.\nA poor half was made worse when he was caught by a flailing elbow from Lewis Dunk that left the 29-year-old with blood running down his head.\nAnd there was little link-up play between Arnautovic and Carroll, perhaps contributing to the fact that the Englishman did not emerge for the second half.\nHis replacement Lucas Perez dropped shorter to offer West Ham a different option up front, but it was only after they conceded twice, and Noble and Antonio came on, that they really started to find their rhythm.\nImmediately, they started to play the ball in behind the Brighton defence and it paid dividends.\nThere were chances in the first period as Arnautovic tested David Button in the Brighton goal and Felipe Anderson wasted a decent chance at the edge of the area.\nBut after seven games in December and four in the last 12 days, the hosts struggled as Brighton started faster and took advantage after the interval.\nThat was before Arnautovic ensured there was a positive start to the year after a poor 2-0 defeat at Burnley on 30 December.\nBrighton set-piece expertise pays off again\nChris Hughton's side can temper the disappointment of losing their lead with the fact that, until their quickfire double when Stephens scored a first Premier League goal, they did not create great deal.\nThey also continued their unbeaten run against West Ham over the last two seasons and have gained five points over the festive period after losing their previous three Premier League games.\nThe fact that both goals came from corners underlined the diligence and organisation that runs through this Hughton team, which looks more than capable of remaining in the top flight for a second successive season.\nThe first was fortunate given that neither Perez or Robert Snodgrass chose to pick up Stephens as he scored from the edge of the area with a well-taken strike.\nBut the second goal, when Duffy found space, looked like it was straight off the training ground as Brighton sent their travelling supporters wild.\nAlthough Hughton will rue a chance to chalk up a third away win of the season, he will also be wise to the fact that West Ham had won five of their previous seven games prior to this contest.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic\n'I don't remember any chances for them' - what they said\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"I'm absolutely frustrated. The most important way that Brighton scores is from set pieces, they had seven goals form corners. And we allowed them to score two goals this way. I don't remember any other chances for them, but we didn't create in first 45 minutes.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"When you are 2-0 up in any game, it's hard to take when the opposition get back to level terms. At that stage the momentum was with them, but to gather our composure was pleasing and away from home it was a good performance. I'm delighted with the goals we got.\"\nOn whether Antonio went out of play for Arnautovic's equaliser, he added: \"I've seen one angle that looks like it might have gone out, but someone else has told me it was just in play.\n\"At the moment no complaints, we defended really well particularly in the first half, and there was probably only a handful of times where we didn't defend well and that's where they got their chances.\n\"Any point here is a good point, but today it's not because we were 2-0 up. It could have unravelled, but I thought we knuckled down and showed good composure.\"\nWest Ham striker Marko Arnautovic: \"I can't be happy. Obviously we talked about the game we wanted to win at home. First half was a boring game from both sides, second half they had two set-pieces and after those we started to play football.\n\"With a bit of luck we can take a win away, but we didn't and it was a fair draw.\nRaining goals - the best of the stats\nWest Ham have only won one of their eight top-flight matches against Brighton (D2 L5), winning 2-1 in March 1983.\nThere were just 125 seconds between Dale Stephen's opener for Brighton and Shane Duffy putting the Seagulls two goals in front, whilst there were 131 seconds between Marko Arnautovic's two strikes for West Ham.\nMarko Arnautovic scored his first Premier League brace for West Ham since March 2018 against Southampton.\nBrighton's Shane Duffy has scored four goals in 18 Premier League appearances this campaign - his joint-highest goal return in a single season across the top four tiers of English Football.\nStephens' opener for Brighton was his first league goal since December 2016 against Blackburn Rovers in the Championship.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham host Birmingham in the FA Cup third round on 5 January (12:30 GMT) before hosting Arsenal in the Premier League the following Saturday. Brighton travel west along the south coast to face Bournemouth in the FA Cup on 5 January (12:30), ahead of hosting Premier League leaders Liverpool on 12 January."

It's up to the board.\"\nSarri, who dismissed the prospect of recalling strikers Michy Batshuayi and Tammy Abraham from loan spells at Valencia and Aston Villa respectively, watched his side fail to score for the second successive home league game.\nFor Southampton, they kept their first clean sheet in 11 Premier League games, but still dropped into the bottom three as they fall below Burnley into 18th after the Clarets' 2-1 win at Huddersfield.\nChelsea's best chance fell to Eden Hazard, but his well-hit shot was saved by Premier League debutant Angus Gunn.\nMorata thought he had scored when he put the ball into the net midway through the second half, but it was ruled out as he was given offside.\nSouthampton offered little as an attacking force, with one Oriol Romeu shot easily saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nThe hosts wanted a late penalty as Marcos Alonso went to ground under a challenge from Shane Long, but referee Jonathan Moss was not interested in Chelsea's appeals.\nAnalysis and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nWillian injury on a frustrating night for Chelsea\nBefore the game, Sarri said the club \"was in trouble\" because of their injury problems and the fact they would have to play \"every three days\" in January.\nThose problems worsened in the first half as Willian, following a strong challenge from Maya Yoshida, limped off to be replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, himself only just returning to contention after a back injury.\nIt means the Brazilian joins Giroud (ankle), Pedro (hamstring) and Callum Hudson-Odoi (hamstring) as attacking options that are unavailable for the Blues, who could play as many as eight games this month.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Chelsea announced they have signed 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund forward Christian Pulisic for 64m euros (\u00a358m), although he will also not feature for the Blues in 2018-19 as he will be loaned back to the German club until the end of the season.\nThis performance shows why Sarri has opted to strengthen his squad as once again Morata failed to impress up front with the Spaniard failing to score for the seventh consecutive Premier League game.\nHe had a weak header easily saved after Cesar Azpilicueta's long ball forward and looked to have ended his goalless run but was denied by the assistant referee's flag as he was judged offside.\nThe draw means Chelsea are now 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who play their game in hand, away at Manchester City, on Thursday.\nHasenhuttl tightens up Saints' defence\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl opted to make eight changes to the side that began the 3-1 loss against Manchester City on Sunday, including a Premier League debut for 22-year-old goalkeeper Gunn, son of ex-Norwich goalkeeper Bryan.\nGunn did well to quickly come off his line and clear the danger on a couple of times in the first half and also denied Hazard, with the Belgian's powerful shot hitting him in the face.\nHasenhuttl had organised his team well and they proved hard to break down with a back five and at times five midfielders in front of them with Danny Ings and then his replacement Shane Long, sometimes operating as their lone striker, but often dropping back to help their team-mates further.\nThe tactics worked as the hosts could only manage two shots on target in the first half - Hazard's effort saved by Gunn and Morata's weak header.\nGunn, who cost the Saints \u00a310m in a summer move from Manchester City, was busier in the second half as he parried a Hazard effort, caught a rising Jorginho shot, held on to a Morata strike and denied Alonso in stoppage time.\nThe final whistle saw Hasenhuttl punch the air in celebration as his side picked up their seventh point in his six games in charge - including matches against three of the top five - Arsenal, Manchester City and now Chelsea.\nIt was also only the fifth time Southampton had stopped the opposition from scoring in 21 Premier League matches in 2018-19 and was their first clean sheet since 27 October when they drew 0-0 at home with Newcastle.\nMan of the match - Angus Gunn (Southampton)\n'We deserved a point' - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri told BBC Sport: \"We had four or five goal opportunities but sometimes if you want to have a lot of opportunities you have to score the first goal.\n\"We did not move the ball very well and we need to improve. We were playing without important players like Pedro, Willian after 30 minutes, Callum Hudson-Odoi was out. On the bench I only had one offensive player Loftus (Ruben Loftus-Cheek) and he is not very well at the moment with back trouble.\"\nOn the signing of Christian Pulisic, Sarri added: \"I didn't know anything about Christian Pulisic yesterday. The club asked my opinion about him one month ago and my opinion was positive and I knew the deal was done but I didn't know anything. I'm not in charge of the market.\n\"We have to play every three days so I cannot think of next year, I have to think about the next match.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport: \"I think it was very hard work against the ball. The guys were brave, sometimes pressing high, sometimes deeper. We didn't give so many chances away, they have fantastic quality and to defend every attack is not easy, but with our mentality we deserved a point.\n\"In the last 30 minutes you feel tired, we had to close the gaps and if you have guy like Eden Hazard dribbling at you, you need a lot of players near him to stop him.\n\"We made the right decision to change so many players against Manchester City to keep them fresh for today. I don't want to say we gave the Manchester City game away but we had more chances today. It was an amazing fight we gave.\"\nOn goalkeeper Gunn, who kept a clean sheet on his debut, Hasenhuttl added: \"The guy showed he is a very forward defensive goalkeeper. We knew about Chelsea's chipped balls forward and we told him to be brave. He made some good saves and I'm happy with him.\"\nAnother home blank for Chelsea - the stats\nSouthampton have only won four of their 20 visits to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League (drew six, lost 11), most recently a 3-1 win over Jose Mourinho's Blues in October 2015.\nChelsea have failed to score in three of their last five Premier League games at Stamford Bridge, as many as in their previous 22 in the competition.\nSouthampton have drawn nine Premier League games by a 0-0 scoreline since the start of last season; two more than any other side.\nSouthampton have recorded their first Premier League clean sheet since October, conceding 24 goals in their previous 10 before today.\nAt 22 years and 346 days, Southampton's Gunn is the youngest English goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet on his Premier League debut since Ben Amos for Manchester United against Stoke in January 2012 (21 years, 295 days).\nGunn (one) has recorded more Premier League clean sheets at Stamford Bridge than his father Bryan did (none in three attempts).\nMorata has recorded 1.9 offsides per game this season, the most of any player to have played at least 90 minutes.\nCesc Fabregas' appearance for Chelsea vs Southampton is his 500th for English club sides in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea entertain Championship side Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 5 January (15:00 GMT) and then face Tottenham away from home in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final on Tuesday, 8 January, before returning to league action on Saturday, 12 January when they play Newcastle.\nSouthampton play in the FA Cup at Derby on Saturday (15:00 GMT), before another trip to the East Midlands to face Leicester in the Premier League a week later."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 3-3 Watford: Draw after goal crazy first period\nWatford captain Troy Deeney said \"Sunday League\" defending contributed to his side's astonishing 3-3 draw at Bournemouth, with all six goals arriving in a frenetic first half.\n\"It was an end-to-end game that could have been 6-6,\" said Deeney, who scored two of his side's goals.\n\"As entertainers we are happy, but not as professionals, the only people that are happy are the fans. The defending from both teams was Sunday League at best to be honest.\"\nThe Cherries recovered a two-goal deficit and then levelled again after Ken Sema's strike to peg the visitors back to 3-3.\nDeeney's textbook header from Sema's cross gave the Hornets the lead and the forward scored his 117th goal for Watford when he lifted the ball over Cherries keeper Asmir Begovic after Gerard Deulofeu was tackled by Steve Cook.\nBut Bournemouth hit back thanks to Ryan Fraser's free-kick deliveries, with Nathan Ake nodding in after visiting keeper Ben Foster brilliantly parried from Dan Gosling and Callum Wilson looping in a header to bring the hosts level.\nWatford regained their lead 85 seconds later though, with Sema collecting a Deeney knock-down to drive a left-foot shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards.\nHowever, that advantage lasted just over a minute as Fraser steered a right-foot shot into the bottom corner after Josh King's dummy, to conclude an astonishing 13-minute spell that contained five goals.\nThe result sees Watford move to eighth while Bournemouth remain 12th.\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League matches\nDefensive flaws contribute to classic\nWith Bournemouth captain Simon Francis and full-back Adam Smith both long-term absentees, the extent of manager Eddie Howe's injury problems were highlighted by his selection of Junior Stanislas at right-back.\nWhile the forward added to Bournemouth's attacking threat it did little to stabilise them at the other end of the pitch, with the quality of their defending contributing to all of Watford's goals.\nThe first came through a lack of organisation, with Sema allowed to run clear before hanging up a cross for Deeney, who found the net with his header despite the presence of several Bournemouth defenders.\nCook then slid into a challenge on Deulofeu but careered into Deeney's marker Ake to present the ball to the Watford striker to score his second.\nFor Watford's third goal, Deeney won a header in front of Ake and Jefferson Lerma stood too far off Sema to be able to block the forward's shot.\n\"Defences weren't on top, we didn't get one or two situations right, but we're going through one of those spells where every shot against us seems to go in,\" said Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.\nWith Watford hardly much better defensively, it led to a crazy end to the half.\nDespite Foster brilliantly keeping out Gosling's header, they allowed the hosts three free headers inside their penalty box while conceding their first.\nAnd they were all at sea when King's step over gave Fraser the time to pick his spot for Bournemouth's third.\nLittle and large excel in game of contrasts\nThe physical presence of Deeney was a nuisance throughout the game for the defensively feeble hosts.\nBournemouth have now conceded 18 goals in their last six Premier League games and they struggled to contain Deeney's power, particularly aerially - with the forward winning 50% of his headers.\nDeeney's movement was also good for both his goals as he intelligently held his runs to evade the attention of a home defence that he had outmuscled and outmanoeuvred.\nIn contrast, Bournemouth's attacking thrust was expertly supplied by the diminutive Fraser, recalled by Howe after their 4-1 defeat at Manchester United on 30 December.\nThe 5ft 4in forward was undeterred by a high challenge from Abdoulaye Doucoure in the 29th minute that was described as a \"recipe for a broken leg\" by BBC Match of the Day summariser Jermaine Jenas.\nAnd it was his technical quality and capacity to deliver dangerous set-pieces that was the basis for Bournemouth's revival.\nThe Scotland winger then displayed admirable composure to equalise at the end of the chaotic goal-laden period when it would have been so easy to snatch at the chance.\nMan of the match - Troy Deeney (Watford)\nGoal-crazy game - the stats\nThe first half saw six goals scored; the most in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game since May 2015 (Southampton vs Aston Villa).\nThere were just 12 minutes and 41 seconds between the second and sixth goals being scored.\nBournemouth attempted 12 shots on target; the most they have ever had in a Premier League match.\nRyan Fraser has been involved in 14 goals for Bournemouth in the Premier League this season (five goals, nine assists); the most by a Scottish player in the competition in a single season since Shaun Maloney in 2012-13 (also 14).\nBournemouth's Callum Wilson has now been involved in 14 goals this season in the Premier League (nine goals, five assists) - the only English players to be involved in more are Harry Kane (18) and Raheem Sterling (15).\nTroy Deeney has now scored seven competitive goals against Bournemouth as a Watford player; his most against an opponent for the Hornets.\nDeeney has now scored four goals from open play this season in the Premier League; two more than in 2017-18.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host Brighton in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday 5 January (12:30 GMT), while Watford travel to non-league Woking in the competition on Sunday 6 January (14:00 GMT)."

The sight of the Belgium midfielder as an unused substitute was an indicator of the strength still to come from the champions.\nThey can now look upon a reduced Liverpool lead and believe they have very much kept alive their hopes of retaining the title.\n'Man City show substance as well as style in crucial victory'\n'Every game is a final' says Guardiola after 'good result for the Premier League'\nFootball Daily: Title race back on as Man City beat Liverpool\nLiverpool still in pole position\nLiverpool's disappointment was clear as manager Jurgen Klopp and his players trudged off at the end of their first league defeat of the season - a result that backed up Klopp's insistence that this title race has a long way to run.\nThe Reds were not at their intense best, although they can look back at Mane hitting the post and several other scrambles as key moments that went against them.\nThey will be disappointed at the manner of City's opener as Aguero, with a brilliant finish, preyed on the fatal hesitation of Lovren, who had a thoroughly forgettable night.\nYet once the frustration subsides, Liverpool can reflect on a superb start to the season that has left them with clear daylight at the summit - something that looked so unlikely just a few weeks ago.\nThey are still in the position everyone wants to occupy.\nWhy first defeat will not knock Liverpool's title belief - Lawrenson analysis\nKlopp bemoans lack of Kompany red card\n'They should play each other every week' - how social media reacted\nMan of the match - Fernandinho (Man City)\n'If we lose it is almost over - every game is a final'\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am proud of them, but not just today. We lost two games in four days but you can't forget what they have done for 16 months. We knew that it was a final today, if we lose it is almost over.\n\"All credit to these incredible players. That is how we have to play in the Champions League. Both teams tried to search for each other, we were not scared, we had no fear and we had a lot of pressure.\n\"They are leaders - it is four points but we have reduced the gap. We knew that if we won we would be in contention to fight for the Premier league, if we lose it is over.\n\"I don't remember a league so tough, there are so many huge contenders fighting for the title. Every game is a final.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was a big pressure. Very intense game. We were unlucky in our finishing moments. Unluckier than City I would say.\n\"They had periods where they dominated the game and everybody felt the intensity. But we came back and had big chances. It is always like this. You have to score in those moments. When Aguero scores there is no angle. In similar situations we didn't score.\n\"It was not our or City's best game because we both made it difficult for the other team. I have already said to the boys this is OK. We lost it but it will happen. Tonight it is not nice but it is not the biggest problem.\"\nRelive the action at Etihad Stadium\nThe stats - Aguero loves facing the 'big six'\nManchester City ended Liverpool's unbeaten start to the Premier League season in the 21st match - only Arsenal in 2003-04 (38 games), Manchester United in 2010-11 (24) and Man City in 2017-18 (22) have had longer unbeaten starts.\nThis was only City's second win in their past 12 matches against Liverpool. They have lost seven of those but won at the Etihad in the league for the past two seasons.\nSince the start of the 2011-12 season, Aguero has scored 37 league goals for City in matches against the other 'big six' clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham) - 16 more than any other player.\nLiverpool have lost 10 of their 25 games under Klopp in January (winning eight), which makes up 29% of his 35 defeats as Reds boss.\nSince the start of last season, Sane has been involved in 26 goals in 25 home league appearances for Manchester City (nine goals, 17 assists).\nFirmino scored his 10th goal of the season for Liverpool, registering double figures for the fourth consecutive season (11 in 2015-16, 12 in 2016-17, 27 in 2017-18).\nThe Reds conceded more than once in a Premier League game for the first time since drawing 2-2 at West Brom in April.\nManchester City won a league match against a team starting the day top of the table for the first time since winning 2-1 against Liverpool in December 2013.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in FA Cup action, with Manchester City hosting Championship side Rotherham United on Sunday (14:00 GMT) and Liverpool visiting Premier League rivals Wolves on Monday (19:45)."

At 19 years old, I am sure we will see a top, top player.\"\nRice beat Bernd Leno with a first-time shot after a good lay-off by Samir Nasri, who was making his first top-flight appearance in England since August 2016.\nThe maiden top-flight goal comes two weeks after Rice signed a new contract that will keep him with the Hammers until 2024.\nBefore that, the international future of Rice, who can play at centre-back or in centre midfield, had been in the headlines.\nHe has earned three caps for the Republic of Ireland, all in friendlies, and the London-born man could yet decide to declare for England.\nIn a highly-competitive London derby, Alexandre Lacazette was denied by an excellent save from Lukasz Fabianski as Arsenal failed to score in the league for the first time since the opening day of the season.\nWest Ham were full value for their win, with Marko Arnautovic, Rice, Nasri and Felipe Anderson all going close when the game was goalless.\nReaction from London Stadium\nArnautovic 'wants West Ham to accept \u00a335m Chinese bid'\nJuventus leading race to sign Arsenal's Ramsey\nWhile West Ham finished the day ninth in the table after a sixth win in nine league games, Arsenal lost ground in the race for a Champions League spot.\nThe Gunners are six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who beat Newcastle 2-1.\nBright future for Rice and West Ham\nThis was a result to remember for Manuel Pellegrini and West Ham, with the performance a fitting way to mark 50 Premier League games at London Stadium.\nBournemouth, Wolves, Tottenham, Manchester City and Watford have all won at the venue this season.\nYet the Hammers turned in one of their best performances under Pellegrini to claim a first win over Arsenal since 2015.\nNasri brought an air of authority and added quality to the midfield while Marko Arnautovic was busy and inventive despite the player's agent and brother saying the Austrian striker wants to move to a Chinese club during this transfer window.\nThe 29-year-old did, however, wave to fans when he was replaced with 20 minutes to go.\nWest Ham are not home again until 4 February - after the transfer window closes - and if Arnautovic was saying his goodbyes, at least West Ham's future is bright in the shape of Rice.\nThe teenager has been a revelation this season and played with an air of maturity way beyond his years.\nAfter spurning a good chance to open the scoring on the stroke of half-time when he headed wide, Rice punished Arsenal's defence with a superb finish into the roof of the net after a poor headed clearance.\nWill Arsenal finish in the top four?\nArsenal are now without a win in five league games away from the Emirates Stadium and are playing catch-up in the race for a Champions League place.\nOnly leaders Liverpool and Manchester City have found the net more than the Gunners, but against West Ham they failed to score in the league for only the second time this season - and have not kept a clean sheet since 8 December.\nPerhaps more worryingly for Unai Emery's side, they rarely looked like getting back on level terms after Rice's special finish.\nEmery even sent on Aaron Ramsey, who will leave Arsenal at the end of the season, to try and rescue his side.\nArsenal had started well enough with Alexandre Lacazette looking particularly sharp and strong.\nTeenager Matteo Guendouzi went close from outside the area when the game was goalless, while Aaron Creswell made a superb challenge to deny a rare chance for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\nOn a day to forget, captain Laurent Koscielny did find the net in the third minute of stoppage time but his header was ruled out for offside.\nMan of the match - Declan Rice (West Ham)\nTeenage kicks - the stats\nDeclan Rice became the 10th teenager to score a Premier League goal for West Ham, and the first since Junior Stanislas in November 2009.\nArsenal have taken just two points from their past five away Premier League games - they won 13 in the five away games prior to this run.\nWest Ham registered only their third home Premier League win against Arsenal and their first since November 2006, ending a run of 10 home games without victory against the Gunners.\nSamir Nasri played his first Premier League game for West Ham and registered his first assist in the competition since April 2016, when he assisted Sergio Aguero for Man City against Chelsea.\nArsenal are one of three Premier League teams yet to lead at half-time in an away Premier League match this season, along with Burnley and Cardiff City.\nHammers boss Manuel Pellegrini remains unbeaten in seven home matches against Unai Emery in all competitions during his managerial career.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth are next up for West Ham at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday, 19 January (15:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Cardiff 0-0 Huddersfield: Terriers awarded penalty, before referee changes his mind\nManager David Wagner said that \"decisions like that make seasons\" after the Premier League's bottom side Huddersfield Town were controversially denied a late penalty at relegation rivals Cardiff City.\nWith 14 minutes left, Huddersfield thought they had a golden opportunity to snatch what would only have been their third win of the season when referee Lee Mason awarded them a penalty after Cardiff's Joe Bennett brought down Florent Hadergjonaj.\nBut assistant referee Stuart Burt intervened to tell Mason that it was in fact Hadergjonaj who had fouled Bennett, and Mason reversed his decision, prompting a furious reaction from the Huddersfield dugout.\n\"I really can't find the words how this can happen,\" Wagner said.\n\"The fourth official had no idea either, he was a surprised as everyone else was. Decisions like this make tables and seasons. We have had so many decisions against us and I don't know why.\n\"It was clearly a penalty, the video footage speaks for itself and we have not got it.\"\nThe result means the Terriers stay at the foot of the Premier League, eight points adrift of safety, while Cardiff remain 17th in the table, one point in front of 18th-placed Newcastle.\nRelive Cardiff City v Huddersfield Town as it happened\nAnalysis and reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nHuddersfield denied rare win\nNine successive defeats in all competitions had cut Huddersfield adrift at the bottom of the Premier League, eight points behind Cardiff in the first position of safety.\nChief among the reasons for their slump was an alarming lack of goals. Their total of 13 was the lowest in the division, with only five of those coming from open play.\nDespite their struggles, however, there was no suggestion that Wagner's position was under threat.\nAlthough his job was safe, Wagner recognised the importance of this match and described it beforehand as \"a game we have to win and it's a game which can affect our season massively\".\nLike Cardiff, there was no shortage of endeavour from the Terriers but their dismal recent form had left them almost entirely devoid of confidence in attack.\nThey did at least improve as the match wore on, enjoying long spells of possession and putting their opponents under pressure during the second half.\nThen, with 76 minutes gone, Huddersfield were given a precious opportunity to score a rare goal and secure an even rarer win when they awarded a penalty.\nBut Mason's decision to reverse that call was a brutal body blow for the visitors.\nAlthough this draw stopped the rot of eight successive league losses, this point will do little to allay the fears that Huddersfield are destined for the drop.\n\"The boys left everything on the grass, and only one team deserved something out of the game,\" Wagner said. \"One point is not enough, we needed to win.\"\nCardiff frustration - and relief\nMuch like Huddersfield last season, at the start of this campaign Cardiff had been tipped by many for an instant and ignominious return to the Championship following their improbable promotion.\nBut also like the Terriers' first term back in the top flight, Neil Warnock's side had confounded their doubters to give themselves a fighting chance of surviving.\nTheir home form had been crucial to those hopes, with four of their five victories coming at Cardiff City Stadium, often full and intimidatingly loud.\nThere was another lively atmosphere on this occasion, albeit fuelled by the two sets of players' commitment and passion rather than any quality.\nScoring opportunities were at a premium for both sides, though Cardiff felt they should have had two penalties in the first half - one for handball from Erik Durm and another when Hadergjonaj brought down Junior Hoilett as the Bluebirds winger bore down on goal.\nHowever, the disappointment of missing out on those spot-kicks paled into insignificance compared to the reprieve Cardiff got when Mason reversed his decision to award Huddersfield a late penalty.\nA goalless draw against the league's bottom side may feel like a wasted opportunity for Warnock and his players but, given their late let-off, their sense of frustration may be tempered by one of relief.\n\"I think it is good there was an experienced linesman,\" said Warnock.\n\"There was not enough contact for a penalty and the linesman made him change his mind. If that had won them the game I would've been disappointed.\n\"But I think there was a clear penalty for us on Junior Hoilett in the first half - the lad [Florent Hadergjonaj] did not see him coming and took him out.\"\nMan of the match - Sol Bamba (Cardiff)\nGoalless, again - the stats\nBoth Premier League matches between Cardiff and Huddersfield have ended goalless this season despite 36 shots attempted across the two games.\nHuddersfield picked up their first Premier League point in nine matches, ending an eight-game losing run (played nine, won none, drew one, lost eight).\nCardiff had as many players booked as they managed shots in this match (three).\nCardiff remain the only Premier League side yet to lead at half-time in a match this season.\nHuddersfield have failed to score in 52% of their Premier League matches (31 of 60).\nCardiff had the first shot of the match after just 29 seconds - they had to wait until the 70th minute for their next effort at goal.\nRhys Healey played his second Premier League match for Cardiff City - four years and 246 days after playing his first against Chelsea in May 2014.\nThis was the eighth Premier League match in which Huddersfield had as much as 60% possession - they have won none of those games (won none, drew three, lost five).\n'We didn't deserve to win' - what they said\nCardiff City manager Neil Warnock to Match of the Day: \"I'm disappointed - we didn't play very well, we had one or two players with injuries but they gave me a shift and if you cannot win a game you have to keep a clean sheet.\n\"Hopefully I will get a few players in. We're trying hard and will continue to do that, you can see we need help.\"\nCardiff captain Sean Morrison: \"We wanted to take three points but with our performance we didn't deserve to win the game and we're disappointed. Huddersfield played with a lot less pressure, it was an all-or-nothing performance from them.\n\"We've got better players than we have shown today and if we want to stay in the Premier League our performances need to be better and we need to create chances.\"\nOn the penalty Huddersfield were awarded before referee Lee Mason changed his mind: \"From my point of view it was not a penalty. It was two or three yards before he went down. The referee gave it, spoke to a linesman and overturned.\"\nWhat's next?\nCardiff play at Newcastle on Saturday, 19 January (15:00 GMT), before Huddersfield are at home against Manchester City a day later (13:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-1 Fulham: Clarets win crucial relegation battle without shot on target\nSean Dyche conceded good fortune was on Burnley's side after two Fulham own goals in three minutes saw the Clarets claim victory at Turf Moor, without registering a single shot on target.\n\"We have had a bit of luck today with the own goals but we haven't had much this season,\" admitted manager Dyche.\nA stunning Andre Schurrle volley had seen the visitors take the lead after two minutes before defenders Joe Bryan and Denis Odoi both diverted the ball into their own net.\nJeff Hendrick was the provider for both goals, with the Republic of Ireland international's drilled cross cannoning in off Bryan's left leg for the equaliser.\nAnd a clipped cross into the Fulham box from the left, saw Odoi head past Sergio Rico.\nIt is the first time since August 2003 that a team has scored two goals in the Premier League without a shot on target and Burnley have also become the fifth team to win a match in the competition without registering a single shot on target after Crystal Palace, Watford, Sunderland and Middlesbrough.\nCottagers boss Claudio Ranieri introduced Luciano Vietto off the bench in the second half, and the striker came closest to finding the equaliser with two good chances.\nHe was denied first by James Tarkowski on the line before Clarets captain Tom Heaton produced a fine save.\nA third consecutive league win sees Burnley move up to 15th in the table, while a tenth defeat on the road means Fulham remain in 19th.\nBurnley recover after early setback\nVictory for Sean Dyche's men saw Burnley become the first side since Crystal Palace beat Watford in March 2017, to claim three Premier League points without a shot on target.\nHowever, Schurrle's sensational strike saw them make the worst possible start as they struggled to find any rhythm for the opening 15 minutes.\nHendrick, who was one of four players to retain his place in the starting line-up from last weekend's FA Cup victory over Barnsley, was Burnley's biggest threat.\nAs the home side began to impose themselves on the game, the midfielder had three shots - albeit all off target.\nAnd when the equaliser eventually came, it was Hendrick who reacted quickest at the back post to collect a Dwight McNeil cross and his low centre ricocheted in off the helpless Bryan.\nAnd the winner came after Hendrick switched sides and lifted a ball into the Fulham box from the left, and Odoi was equally as helpless as he nodded the ball into his own net.\nIn dreadful conditions, with rain and wind swirling round Turf Moor, Burnley also had the game's best defender with Tarkowski making six clearances, the most in the game.\nIn front of the watching England manager Gareth Southgate, Tarkowski's best moment came when he kept out Vietto's fierce effort on his own goalline with Heaton beaten.\nFulham's defensive frailties exposed\nWhile the scoreline was harsh on Fulham, who created the better chances and saw more of the ball, particularly in the second half when they had 71% of the possession, Ranieri will be most concerned with his side's defending.\nThe Cottagers play with three centre-halves and two wing-backs, but the five-man defence lost possession 94 times between them at Turf Moor.\nHaving taken the lead, Fulham defenders were caught dawdling on the ball twice, as Maxime Le Marchand and Tim Ream both conceded possession in dangerous areas as Burnley were gaining a foothold in the game.\nThe Clarets let both opportunities slip from their grasp but the warning signs were there for the visitors.\nTwo own goals in quick succession showed signs of inexperience and uncertainty at the heart of the worst defence in the Premier League - the Cottagers have conceded 49 goals - and Ranieri may look to shore up his back line in this transfer window with a relegation battle looming.\nMan of the match - Dwight McNeil (Burnley)\n'Football is fantastic' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche told Match of the Day: \"I am very pleased, a lot of hard work has gone into that from the players. Not just physically.\n\"Some of our performances have been OK but details kill you at this level. Big moments make a difference, as we saw today. James Tarkowski makes a brilliant block on the line and today it stayed out.\n\"A lot has been asked of us this season, we have come out of a real sticky first half of the season.\n\"We are not interested in selling any of our players. I believe in all of them.\"\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri on Sky Sports:\n\"Football is fantastic. We deserved more but that's football.\n\"They had three chances and scored two own goals. We are alive, we never give up and we continue to fight.\n\"I am satisfied with our performance. We knew it would be a battle, they won so they are right and we are wrong.\"\nFulham's away woes continue - the stats\nBurnley have collected nine points from their last three Premier League games (P3 W3 D0 L0), one more than they managed from their previous 13 matches in the competition (P13 W2 D2 L9).\nFulham's 14 points after their opening 22 matches is their lowest tally at this stage of a season in the club's history (converting three points for a win).\nFulham are the first side to score at least two own goals in the first half of a Premier League match since Everton did so against Southampton back in April 2014.\nFulham, who are yet to win away (P12 W0 D2 L10), are the first side in the Premier League to fail to win any of their opening 12 opening matches on the road in the competition since both Leicester (13) and Burnley (17) during the 2016-17 campaign.\nAndre Schurrle's opener against Burnley (01:49) is the quickest goal by a Fulham player in the Premier League since Clint Dempsey scored against Norwich City back in March 2012 (01:46).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Watford on Saturday, 19 January (15:00 GMT), while Fulham host Tottenham in a London derby on Sunday, 20 January (16:00)."

        "article_text": "Leicester 1-2 Southampton: Hasenhuttl says Long \u2018deserved\u2019 first goal in nine months\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said Shane Long \"deserved\" his first goal in nine months as the Saints won at Leicester despite spending the entire second half with 10 men.\nLong scored Southampton's crucial second goal in first-half stoppage time at the King Power Stadium, his first in 22 appearances, as the Saints moved out of the Premier League relegation zone.\n\"I said to Shane, 'You deserve to score today because you worked so hard in the week',\" Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport. \"He is quick and has good headers. It was a really good game for him.\n\"I know he hasn't got the best finishing record but I know previously he scored 10 to 12 times. I want to bring him back into this shape.\"\nJames Ward-Prowse gave Southampton an early lead from the penalty spot after Long was bundled over in the area by Nampalys Mendy.\nSaints defender Yan Valery was then shown a second yellow card for a foul on Marc Albrighton before Long doubled their lead shortly before the break.\nWilfred Ndidi scrambled home Ricardo Pereira's cross to bring Leicester back into the game at the start of the second half, but Southampton held on for a priceless victory.\nThe three points lift Southampton above Newcastle and Cardiff into 16th place. Leicester drop one to eighth.\nIt is a third win in seven Premier League games for new Saints manager Hasenhuttl, who punched the air with delight at the final whistle.\nHis side were forced to defend on the edge of their own penalty area for the entirety of the second half, but the Southampton backline was superbly marshalled by Jannik Vestergaard, Jan Bednarek and Jack Stephens.\n\"I'm unbelievably proud of my players,\" added Hasenhuttl.\n\"To be manager of this team, it's a fantastic job. Today they showed their quality. To go 2-0 in the lead at Leicester is not easy and we defended with fantastic commitment.\"\nThe boos at the final whistle are unlikely to ease the pressure on Leicester boss Claude Puel, who had demanded a response from his side following last weekend's FA Cup defeat at League Two Newport.\nInstead his team were timid from the outset and despite dominating possession in the second half, rarely looked like threatening Alex McCarthy in the Southampton goal.\nAnalysis and reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nLong ends drought to secure precious victory\nLong would probably not have started this game were it not for injuries to fellow strikers Danny Ings, Charlie Austin and Michael Obafemi.\nThe 31-year-old had failed to hit the back of the net for Southampton since a 3-2 defeat by Chelsea at the start of April and has largely been consigned to the bench this season.\nBut after being restored to the starting line-up for last week's FA Cup draw with Derby, Long retained his place and chose the ideal time to score just his second goal in 36 appearances for club and country.\nThe former Hull, West Brom and Reading striker more than played his role in a disciplined Saints performance as the visitors looked to defend deep before hitting Leicester on the counter.\nThey were helped on their way by some sloppy defending by the Foxes, with Mendy needlessly bundling Long over in the area to allow Southampton to take the lead from the spot.\nMendy and Pereira then failed to deal with a routine goal-kick, allowing Long to steal in and double the away side's lead seconds before the half-time whistle.\nMoments before that goal, teenage defender Valery, who up to that point had been impressive down the Southampton right, was deservedly sent off for a needless tug on Albrighton.\nHowever, Long's goal had given Southampton the buffer they needed to launch a spirited defensive effort in the second half.\nBednarek was at the heart of Southampton's defensive work, making more blocks and clearances than any other Saints player while defensive partner Vestergaard won 100% of his aerial duels.\nPressure increases on beleaguered Puel\nPuel came out fighting in the build-up to this game as he vigorously defended his team selection in the defeat at Newport.\nHe restored many of his senior players to the starting line-up against Southampton, including James Maddison, Harry Maguire and Jamie Vardy.\nBut instead of sparking a response, the Foxes made a timid start as they struggled to break down a stubborn Saints rearguard.\nThey only created one opportunity of note in the first half, when Wes Morgan's scrambled effort from Ben Chilwell's free-kick was cleared off the line by Bednarek.\nNdidi's scuffed finish should have set the platform for a fightback shortly after the break, but the Foxes failed to carve out many clear-cut openings.\nInstead they were restricted to shots from distance, with Maguire responsible for two of their six shots on target while Vardy failed to have a shot on goal at all.\nIt is only three weeks since Leicester secured memorable back-to-back victories against Chelsea and Manchester City, but the boos at the final whistle highlighted the discontent currently simmering among their fanbase.\nStewards removed some small \"Puel out\" banners before kick-off but their presence suggests the Frenchman has much to do if he is to convince some fans he is the right man for the job.\nMan of the match -Jan Bednarek (Southampton)\n'I want to work with these players' - what they said\nLeicester City manager Claude Puel, speaking to MOTD, is asked if he feels under pressure: \"It's not my concern, no comment. I'm just focused and concentrating on my team.\n\"I want to work with these players. It's football. The fans are like us - disappointed and frustrated.\"\nOn the result: \"It's a big disappointment. We wanted to give a good response after the FA Cup against Newport.\n\"It's difficult to accept the second goal we conceded. We had a lot of chances and opportunities. It was important to try and manage this game with intensity in our passes. It was difficult to be clinical and maybe we needed a bit more movement in the box.\n\"It's important to find good moves and understanding and communication.\"\nSaints win on the road again - the stats\nLeicester City's last three Premier League defeats have come against sides starting the day in 16th (Crystal Palace), 17th (Cardiff City) and 18th (Southampton).\nSouthampton have won two of Ralph Hasenhuttl's four away games in the Premier League (D1 L1), as many victories on the road in the competition as in Mark Hughes' full tenure at the club (P12 W2 D3 L7).\nIn matches involving Leicester City in the Premier League this season, there has been nine red cards shown (four for, five against), the most of any club in the division.\nWilfried Ndidi has scored two goals in his last 13 Premier League appearances for Leicester, as many strikes as in his first 59 matches in the competition.\nSouthampton's Yan Valery (19y 324d) is the youngest ever player to be sent off in a Premier League match for the Saints.\nJames Ward-Prowse has scored each of the three penalties he's taken in the Premier League - among current players in the competition, only Danny Ings and Junior Stanislas (4/4) have a better 100% ratio from the spot.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Championship side Derby in an FA Cup third round replay on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) before another home game in the Premier League against Everton next Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nNext up for Leicester is a trip to Molineux to take on Wolves in the lunchtime kick-off next Saturday (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 0-1 Liverpool: Mo Salah scores winner from spot\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp believes his side are no longer \"childish\" in controlling matches after Mohamed Salah's penalty edged out Brighton to extend their lead to seven points at the top of the Premier League.\nThe Reds dominated with more than 70% possession against their cagey hosts but created little in a workmanlike performance until Salah was felled in the area by Pascal Gross.\nThe Egyptian duly lashed the spot-kick left-footed across his body and into the net for a 17th goal of the season.\nBrighton briefly rallied, with Fabinho - at the heart of Liverpool's defence for the injured Dejan Lovren - producing a key block to deny Gross in the area as the home side failed to register a shot on target.\n\"I think it was the most mature performance we have made so far,\" Klopp told BBC Sport. \"There were a few situations where we could have been a bit more inspired, creative and cool.\n\"We know we can control the game and we are not that childish anymore.\"\nKlopp's side were far from their fluent best but comfortably repelled their hosts to lengthen their advantage in the title race, with third-placed Tottenham playing on Sunday and nearest rivals Manchester City not in action until Monday.\n'Mature' Reds get job done\nKlopp embraced Salah at the final whistle after his side had seen off sporadic bursts of pressure from their hosts in the closing stages.\nThe threat of a third straight defeat was held at bay after a loss to City and an FA Cup loss at Wolves, and the Reds can still boast being without back-to-back league defeats under Klopp's charge.\nAt the Amex, they demonstrated the efficiency and control of a side capable of winning while not at their best.\nSalah - who had just 13 touches in a quiet first half - produced a single moment of game-defining trickery to tangle with Gross, and it proved enough as Liverpool eased to a 13th clean sheet of the season.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum flashed a shot wide and Salah missed a glorious chance from six yards after a James Milner pullback, which would have provided late breathing space.\nBut on a day where the heart of Liverpool's defence was shuffled - with Fabinho joining Virgil van Dijk to cover for injuries - Klopp pointed to an \"unbelievably mature\" display by his side as they returned to form.\nGrown-up Reds set relentless pace\nKlopp will also be thrilled by Trent Alexander-Arnold's completion of 90 minutes after the right-back hurt himself during a fall in the warm-up.\nThe 20-year-old appeared tentative early on but his presence was key later when he stretched to flick a Florin Andone cross out of the path of Jurgen Locadia in the area.\nIt was an example of the occasional opening Brighton created without ever getting a clear sight of the league leaders' goal.\nKlopp was quick to state the seven-point gap \"means nothing\".\nBut the manner in which his side are grinding out results is setting a pace rarely seen at the top of the English game. They have now won all 16 games they have played against teams outside the league's top six.\nSuch consistency means only four sides in English top-flight history have ever had more than the 57 points Liverpool boast at this stage of the season if league tables are adjusted to three points for a win.\nAnd only Chelsea's 2004-05 side have leaked fewer goals (8) than the Reds' 10 after 22 games. Klopp has grown a tough nut to crack.\nBrighton disciplined but blunt\nBrighton's fans were angered by referee Kevin Friend's display, though it did appear Gross placed his hands on Salah before catching the Liverpool player's leg in the key moment.\nIn truth, Liverpool's brief increase in tempo immediately after the interval proved vital in undoing a Brighton side which had looked solid until that point.\nSitting deep in a 4-5-1 set-up with no pressure on the ball until it entered their final third, the home side's caution meant their own attacks were minimal - a fact underlined by striker Glenn Murray having just seven touches in the opening 45 minutes.\nKlopp said his side were aware of the threat posed by a team with more set-piece goals than anyone else in the league, but even dead-ball scenarios proved fruitless and lacked threat.\nSeagulls boss Chris Hughton faces a testing trip to Manchester United next but his side are three points better off than at this stage last season.\nThe addition of some attacking quality would no doubt help their survival cause but their general organisation remains admirable and will be key in their fight to stay up.\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk\n'We deserved something' - manager reaction\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton:\n\"We were always in the game and were very competitive. I felt we deserved something.\n\"These are the best team in the country. I am conscious of where we are. We have developed well. We have to stay in the game and be compact and look for moments. I thought we had that today.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"We controlled the game in a better way when we scored the goal. We could have done better but I am fine because the target is to win here. We had to perform and deliver and we did that.\"\nSalah the difference again - stats\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton has lost more league games to Liverpool in his managerial career (seven defeats from seven meetings) than any other side. His sides have conceded 26 goals across those seven games.\nThis was Liverpool's 50th clean sheet in the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp in their 128th match with the German in charge since his first in October 2015; 42% of those have come since Virgil van Dijk's league debut in January 2018 (21 in 37 games since).\nBrighton have now lost as many games at the Amex Stadium in all competitions this season (four of 12) as they did in the entirety of 2017-18 on home soil (four of 22 matches).\nLiverpool forward Mohamed Salah has scored the opening goal in nine Premier League games this season; at least three more than any other player.\nOf the last 10 Premier League penalties taken by left-footed players, six have failed to score - the other four have all been scored by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.\nUp next?\nLiverpool host Crystal Palace on 19 January in a 15:00 GMT kick-off, when Brighton will be playing at Manchester United."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-2 Watford: Cleverley volley sinks Palace\nTom Cleverley's superb second-half volley helped Watford come from behind to beat Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.\nThe former Manchester United midfielder - who had only been on the field for six minutes - thumped James Tomkins' clearance into the top corner for his first league goal since October 2017.\nPalace had taken the lead seven minutes before half-time, Abdoulaye Doucoure's attempted clearance rebounding off the unfortunate Craig Cathcart and past the despairing dive of Ben Foster.\nThe Watford centre-back atoned for his own goal midway through the second half when he headed Jose Holebas' corner into the roof of the net.\nAnd Cleverley struck just seven minutes later to earn Javi Gracia's side a hard-earned three points.\nThe victory lifts the Hornets into seventh place in the table, while Palace remain in 14th - just four points above the relegation zone.\nMissed opportunity for Palace\nThere has been an element of Jekyll and Hyde about Palace's performances of late.\nEye-catching victories at Manchester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers have lifted Roy Hodgson's side away from the relegation zone in recent weeks, but the Eagles had failed to land a goal in both their last two league games at Selhurst Park, prior to Saturday's encounter.\nThey also needed a late Jordan Ayew goal to squeeze past League Two Grimsby Town in the third round of the FA Cup.\nBut the Eagles went in front against Watford in fortuitous circumstances as Cathcart deflected Doucoure's clearance past his own goalkeeper. They deserved their narrow half-time lead, though, after keeping Watford's potent attack at bay for the majority of the first 45 minutes.\nWilfried Zaha, who has not found the net since September 2018, should have doubled his side's lead three minutes into the second half when he failed to beat Ben Foster in a one-on-one situation.\nJames McArthur then failed to connect with Zaha's low cross as Palace dominated the beginning of the second period, before two Watford goals in seven minutes turned the match on its head.\nHodgson's team have now scored just six league goals on their own turf this season - only Huddersfield have netted fewer goals at home.\nFortunate Watford continue fine away form\nWatford have now collected 18 points on their travels this season - two more than they managed in the entirety of last term.\nGracia's charges have had few problems scoring goals, netting 13 in their last seven league matches before Saturday's game, but the Hornets struggled for long periods at Selhurst Park and failed to register a single shot on target in a disappointing first-half display.\nThey spurned a glorious opportunity to take the lead after just three minutes, Gerard Deulofeu striking the foot of the post before Roberto Pereyra rattled the woodwork from the rebound with the goal at his mercy.\nThat was the closest they came to an equaliser until Cathcart hauled the visitors level with their first effort on target.\nTheir second shot on goal proved to be the winner, Cleverley's magnificent volley sending the away fans into raptures and lifting Watford back into seventh place above West Ham United and Leicester City.\nThey could have added a third five minutes from time, but Deulofeu's goal-bound free-kick was blocked by Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\nMan of the match - Ben Foster (Watford)\nNo home comforts for Palace - the stats\nCrystal Palace have lost six of their 11 home Premier League matches this season (W2 D3), only one fewer than they lost during the entirety of the 2017/18 campaign (7).\nWatford are unbeaten in four away Premier League matches (W2 D2), their best run since September 2017 (also four unbeaten).\nNo player has scored more Premier League own goals this season than Watford defender Craig Cathcart (2, level with Wesley Hoedt).\nJose Holebas has assisted six Premier League goals this season - more than any other defender.\nWatford's Craig Cathcart became the first player to both score a goal and an own goal in the same Premier League game since Ryan Shawcross in December 2017 (Stoke v Spurs).\nWatford midfielder Tom Cleverley scored his first Premier League goal since October 2017, ending a run of 18 league games without a goal.\n'We needed to create more chances' - what the managers said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson:\n\"Tom Cleverley scores a wonder goal. They happen in football matches and there's not much you can do about them. Watford are a good team and they held out and got the victory.\n\"Every game has those stories at the end but it's the goals you have scored and those you have conceded. We probably needed to create more chances to get the second goal - Watford were good on the counter attack.\n\"They'll probably point to the early chance that hit the post. We have to accept we could have won but it's also a game you can lose and we did.\"\nWatford head coach Javi Gracia:\n\"I think we had the confidence during the game. We started by conceding an own goal but after that the level was the same and in the second half we got the reward with two amazing goals. I am very happy with the performance and attitude of my players.\n\"All the games against Crystal Palace are always very equal, today was again. After conceding the first goal it was more difficult but we knew this team are conceding more goals in this period and it was our moment. We created enough chances to win the game.\n\"All my players deserve more time to play as they are all working very hard to play. I felt the best option was Tom and he scored an amazing goal.\"\nWhat's next?\nPalace travel to Premier League leaders Liverpool on Saturday 19 January (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Watford host Burnley at the same time."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-1 Newcastle United: Pedro and Willian goals give hosts victory\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri said \"very important\" Willian \"has to stay\" with the club after the winger scored a spectacular goal to give the Blues a win over Newcastle.\nWillian curled the ball past Martin Dubravka in the 57th minute after Ciaran Clark's header had cancelled out Pedro's opener.\nEarlier this week, the Blues reportedly rejected a player-plus-cash bid from Barcelona\n, external\nfor the 30-year-old Brazilian in a deal that would have also seen Barca winger Malcom move to Stamford Bridge.\n\"For us Willian is really a very important player,\" said Sarri. \"We need wingers, so we need Pedro, we need (Callum Hudson-) Odoi, we need Willian of course.\n\"In this moment, he's a fundamental player - he has to stay with us.\"\nWillian joined Chelsea from Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala in a \u00a330m deal in August 2013 and has helped the Blues win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup and the League Cup.\nWhen asked about the transfer speculation, he replied: \"My future is here at Chelsea, I don't know what you're talking about.\"\nChelsea are now fourth, one point behind third-placed Tottenham, but six points clear of Arsenal, who they face at Emirates Stadium in their next game on 19 January, while the Magpies have dropped into the relegation zone.\nRelive Chelsea v Newcastle as it happened\nSarri's side do enough for the three points\nChelsea had failed to score in their previous two league matches at Stamford Bridge - a 1-0 loss to Leicester and a goalless draw with Southampton - but they netted in the ninth minute when Pedro collected David Luiz's ball over the top, took a touch, then shot past Dubravka for his seventh goal of the season.\nHowever, with Eden Hazard again featuring as a 'false nine' with Olivier Giroud on the bench and Alvaro Morata left out of the squad, they struggled to create further clear-cut chances before Clark equalised, powerfully heading in from Matt Ritchie's corner.\nThere were boos heard inside Stamford Bridge at half-time, but Sarri's side were greatly improved in the second half, with Hazard a much more prominent threat.\nThe Belgian led Chelsea's attack, which resulted in their second goal as he ran at the Newcastle defence, offloaded to Willian who, from a tight angle, cut inside onto his right foot and curled a beautiful effort past Dubravka with the ball going in off the post.\nWith nine minutes left, 18-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi, the subject of a \u00a335m bid from German champions Bayern Munich, came on for only his second Premier League appearance.\nThe home fans chanted \"we want you to stay\" in the direction of the talented winger, who was part of England's Under-17 World Cup triumph in 2017 and has 18 months left on his current Chelsea deal.\nNewcastle drop into the bottom three\nNewcastle started the day 15th in the Premier League, but wins for Burnley and Southampton - along with Cardiff drawing - leaves Rafael Benitez's side in the bottom three.\nBenitez won the manager of the month award in November, but since then United have only won one match in 10 in all competitions.\nWith the Spaniard unlikely to be given any money to make further signings - amid ongoing uncertainty about a possible takeover - there are real concerns that the club could drop into the second tier after only two seasons back in the top flight.\nBefore the game, Benitez said that the club's \"reality\" was \"having to compete in a division when we cannot compete against Bournemouth, who are spending money\".\nAt Stamford Bridge, Newcastle had late chances to snatch a point, but Ritchie shot over the bar and Salomon Rondon headed a chance wide.\nNewcastle face a hugely important home game against Cardiff in their next league match, before tough assignments against Manchester City and Tottenham.\nMan of the match - Pedro (Chelsea)\nAnother Newcastle failure against a top-six side - the stats\nChelsea have only lost one of their 12 Premier League matches at Stamford Bridge this season, drawing four and winning the other seven.\nNewcastle's total of 18 points from their opening 22 matches is their lowest tally at this stage of a top-flight season since 1988-89 campaign (17 points), with the Magpies going on to be relegated under manager Jim Smith.\nChelsea (played four, won three and drew one) are on their longest unbeaten league run since losing none of their opening 12 league games under manager Maurizio Sarri (played 12, won eight and drew four).\nNewcastle have now lost 10 straight top-flight matches away from home against sides starting the day in the top four, last winning such a match back in November 2010 against Arsenal (played 26, won none, drew three, lost 23 since).\nRafael Benitez has now lost six of his eight away league games against former employers Chelsea in the Premier League (won one, drew one), including his two as Newcastle boss.\nChelsea's Eden Hazard has both scored (10) and assisted (10) at least 10 goals in league games this season - the only other player within the top five European Leagues to have also done so in 2018-19 is Barcelona's Lionel Messi (16 goals, 10 assists).\nPedro has now scored three goals in his two Premier League starts against Newcastle at Stamford Bridge - against no other side in the competition has the Spaniard netted more goals for Chelsea (three, level with Bournemouth).\nOf players with at least 10 Premier League goals, only Ugo Ehiogu (84%) and David Wetherall (87%) have scored a higher percentage of their goals via their head than Newcastle's Kieran Clark (83%).\n'We slept for 20 minutes' - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri speaking to BBC Sport: \"Today was very important to get points. We started well but after the goal we slept for 20 minutes, so by the end of the first half we were in trouble.\n\"We were better in the second half. I'm very happy with the result but we need to improve mentally and technically because we lost a lot of the ball in a stupid way.\n\"I think our wingers attacked the space better than in the last five or six matches but we need to attack the box better.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez speaking to BBC Sport: \"We conceded a goal we could avoid but after that we were fighting for every ball. These players care, you could see that.\n\"We scored and then controlled the last few minutes of the first half so it's a pity, but a piece of quality made the difference.\n\"You could see a lot of positives with the performance but no points. We knew that they would keep the ball and we had to maximise what we did when we got the ball. We had some chances on the counter but our final pass wasn't there.\"\nWhat's next?\nNext up for Chelsea is an away game at Arsenal on Saturday, 19 January (17:30 GMT).\nNewcastle play their FA Cup third-round replay against Championship side Blackburn on Tuesday, 15 January (19:45 GMT), before returning to league action on Saturday when they host Cardiff City (15:00 GMT)"

        "article_text": "Everton 2-0 Bournemouth: Two second-half goals lift Toffees into top half\nTwo second-half goals gave Everton an edgy victory over Bournemouth that lifted them into the top half of the Premier League table.\nKurt Zouma powerfully headed in his first goal for the club from Lucas Digne's cross following a corner in the 61st minute, before Dominic Calvert-Lewin added the second in the fifth minute of stoppage time.\nEverton had been outplayed in the opening 30 minutes but Bournemouth failed to capitalise on their bright start.\nDavid Brooks hit the post when through one-on-one with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and had a strong penalty appeal turned down early on, while Joshua King also had a good chance saved.\nEverton, who had not won any of their previous four home league matches, failed to have a first-half shot on target for the second successive league game at Goodison Park.\nThey improved after the break, with Richarlison having a shot cleared off the line by Nathan Ake and coming close with a header from Gylfi Sigurdsson's cross.\nBournemouth pushed hard for an equaliser in the final minutes, with Michael Keane producing an excellent block to deny Dan Gosling before Calvert-Lewin sealed the three points.\nWhile Everton climb to 10th, Bournemouth stay 12th.\nReaction: Everton v Bournemouth\nImportant win for Silva's Toffees\nEverton's win in the FA Cup against Lincoln last week was just their second in their past nine games.\nWhen asked about any pressure that form had put on his team, manager Marco Silva admitted his side must improve in the second half of the season. Any murmurings of discontent among fans will not have been eased by his side's start.\nEverton struggled to create any real momentum in attack and were edgy in passing the ball out from the back.\nThey were better from the closing stages of the first half with Ademola Lookman lively as he made just his second league start of the season.\nBournemouth struggled to maintain their performance of the opening 30 minutes but their late pressure resulted in mounting tension around Goodison.\nThe crucial block from Keane and strong defending at corners helped Everton keep a first clean sheet for two months.\nAt full-time, the relief was evident both in the dug-out and the stands.\nThe Everton fans had seen their side lose to Leicester and Tottenham and draw with Watford and Newcastle during their winless home run but this time they held on and are now within three points of seventh-placed Watford.\nThey are a place lower in the table lower than at this stage last season, when Sam Allardyce was manager, but are three points better off.\nWilson missed as Cherries away struggles continue\nBournemouth were without Callum Wilson for the trip because of injury - and for all of their good attacking play early on, they missed their top scorer's clinical finishing.\nBrooks never managed to fully get the ball out from under his feet before striking the post and King scuffed his ninth-minute close-range shot a little, giving Pickford the chance to save.\nHad England international Wilson, who has 10 goals this season, been the one attempting to convert those chances then the Cherries may have had earned reward for their strong start.\nBournemouth could also count themselves unfortunate with some of the refereeing decisions, with Brooks denied a penalty early on.\nThe Wales international went down under a challenge from Idrissa Gueye in the 11th minute and the Everton midfielder did not make any contact with the ball.\nThey also had a less convincing first-half penalty appeal turned down when Digne blocked Ryan Fraser's cross with his arm, and another when Andre Gomes hauled over Jefferson Lerma off the ball in the 90th minute.\nManager Eddie Howe praised his side's performance after the game but they have now lost seven of their past nine matches in all competitions.\nOf further worry is the fact that after winning three of their first five away games this season, Bournemouth have now lost their past six.\nMan of the match - Ademola Lookman (Everton)\n'We deserved the three points' - manager reaction\nEverton manager Marco Silva said: \"They were an important three points for us. We knew before the match it was important to turn the last few results back our way.\n\"Even if 2-0 is a tough result to take for them, we deserved the points and our players showed big personality and character as a team.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe said: \"I thought we played well today, we started the game well and we had a good chance with David Brooks but that's how it is going for us. A lot of elements were really strong but ultimately it goes against us.\n\"It will change for us if we continue to hit those levels we were at today, but when you're in that moment, that win seems elusive.\"\nEverton's 100% record - the best stats\nEverton have now won all six of their competitive home matches against Bournemouth, including all four in the Premier League.\nBournemouth have conceded 103 goals in the Premier League since the start of 2017-18, two more than any other team in that period (West Ham are closest on 100).\nKurt Zouma was the 139th different player to score a goal for Everton in the Premier League, only West Ham (147), Tottenham (146) and Newcastle (141) have seen more players net for them in the competition.\nEverton's Lucas Digne has had six goal involvements this season (three goals, three assists), equalling his best ever tally in a top-flight campaign (six for Roma in 2015-16).\nDominic Calvert-Lewin scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season for Everton, equalling his best-ever tally in a top-flight league campaign (four in 2017-18).\nAfter scoring six goals in his first nine Premier League appearances for Everton, Richarlison has scored just three goals in his past 11 games in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nEverton will look to extend their winning run to three games when they travel to play Southampton on Saturday, 19 January (15:00 GMT).\nBournemouth host West Ham on the same day (also 15:00 GMT) as they look to return to winning ways."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 0-1 Manchester United: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men hang on to beat Spurs\nManchester United goalkeeper David de Gea produced a Wembley masterclass as interim manager Ole Gunnaer Solskjaer made it six wins out of six to damage Tottenham's Premier League title ambitions.\nMarcus Rashford's low finish from Paul Pogba's superb pass on the stroke of half-time stretched Solskjaer's flawless start - but the Norwegian had De Gea to thank for a magnificent display as Spurs laid siege to United's goal after the break.\nThe Spaniard made a succession of crucial interventions, 11 in total, including many with his feet, as Spurs tried in vain to avoid a defeat that makes their task of keeping pace with Liverpool and Manchester City even more arduous.\nUnited showed great resilience to back up their early positive approach but it was De Gea who broke Spurs' hearts by denying Harry Kane on several occasions, as well as Dele Alli and Toby Alderweireld.\nThe result leaves Spurs nine points behind leaders Liverpool and United level on points with fifth-placed Arsenal as they revive their top-four hopes.\nLive reaction from Sunday's game at Wembley\nSolskjaer staking his claim\nFew would have placed Solskjaer as a serious contender on any list to replace Jose Mourinho when he was sacked as United boss in December.\nAnd while he may not be the front-runner yet, he has done everything asked of him and this victory against a team in title contention - and with a manager in Mauricio Pochettino who many regard as favourite to be next in the chair at Old Trafford - was the biggest statement of his credentials yet.\nMake no mistake, Solskjaer relied hugely on De Gea's brilliance as he formed a one-man barrier to defy Spurs to secure this win, but he also arrived with a positive mindset and team selection that put United right in the game and led to them getting that half-time lead through Rashford's goal on the counter-attack.\nThis was his sternest test after a relatively friendly introductory fixture list and, with the help of De Gea, he was able to complete it successfully.\nSolskjaer has given a disaffected squad unity of purpose once more, with Pogba seemingly instantly rejuvenated by Mourinho's departure, and this run of wins has rebuilt fractured confidence and belief.\nThe odds on may yet be against Solskjaer claiming the job permanently as other names, such as England manager Gareth Southgate and Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone, are mentioned, but if he is undertaking an audition, wins like this do his chances no harm.\nSpurs pay for lack of cutting edge\nDe Gea gave a brilliant demonstration of goalkeeping - showing that feet can be utilised as successfully as hands when the occasion demands - but there was also real cause for frustration for Spurs.\nPochettino's side created chance after chance after half-time only to be thwarted by De Gea, captain Kane his victim on several occasions.\nNo-one could question Spurs' heart or application but they may feel they could - and should - have done better with many of their opportunities, often giving De Gea the chance to make the saves when more accurate finishing would have left him with no hope.\nThis result is a bitter blow to Spurs as they try to keep pace with Liverpool and Manchester City and the sight of Kane limping heavily and accompanied by a physio after the final whistle is an added worry for Pochettino.\nSpurs have had damaging home defeats to Wolves and now United in recent weeks - they cannot afford many more if they are to maintain a meaningful title pursuit.\nMan of the match - David de Gea\n'Man Utd expect to win every game' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am so pleased and I'm proud. After four and a half years, the second half was the best performance I have seen Tottenham play. It was amazing. In football, sometimes you deserves to win and don't and other times, you do not and you win. That is why we love football.\n\"We conceded a counter-attack in the first half but the second was the best performance I have seen. We were not clinical and sometimes you score with less opportunities but it is nothing to complain about. The team played unbelievable football and everyone who watched the game can feel the same as myself.\"\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solksjaer: \"You expect to win every single game at Manchester United. You won't, but you must think that. That's the mentality of this group.\n\"In the first half we were excellent and in the second they put us under pressure. We could have scored a few as well but we had a good back four and David [de Gea] was unbelievable.\n\"We created enough chances to put the game away by the break, but if you don't score you will be under pressure. We defended fantastically.\"\nSolskjaer matches Busby - the stats\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has equalled Sir Matt Busby's all-time record of winning his first five league games in charge of Manchester United.\nTottenham have lost consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since May 2015.\nTottenham have lost four home league games this season - double the amount they had lost at home in their previous two Premier League campaigns combined (2).\nUnited have kept back-to-back clean sheets in the Premier League - they had only kept two in their first 20 league matches this season.\nMarcus Rashford has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time in his career.\nPaul Pogba has been directly involved in 53% of United's 15 Premier League goals since Solskjaer took charge (4 goals, 4 assists).\nDe Gea made 11 saves - only against Arsenal in December 2017 has he ever made more in a Premier League match (14). This was the most saves he has made in a top-five European league game while also keeping a clean sheet.\nTottenham's Harry Kane had seven shots in this match - he last had more without finding the net in a Premier League game in January 2018 (8 vs Manchester United).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United return to Old Trafford on Saturday, when Brighton are the visitors at 15:00 GMT. Spurs do not play until next Sunday when they travel across London to meet Fulham at 16:00."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-0 Wolves: Gabriel Jesus scores twice as City narrow gap on Liverpool\nGabriel Jesus scored twice as Manchester City eased past 10-man Wolves to cut Liverpool's lead at the top of the table to four points.\nCity did not manage a repeat of the scoring feats that had seen them hit 16 goals against Rotherham and Burton in their previous two games, but the outcome was rarely in doubt despite the relatively modest winning margin.\nJesus opened the scoring after 10 minutes when Leroy Sane ran on to a peach of a pass by Aymeric Laporte and squared for the Brazilian to slide home.\nA tough task for Wolves got even harder when Willy Boly was dismissed nine minutes later, with the French defender shown a straight red card for a dangerous jumping challenge on Bernardo Silva.\nGuardiola tells players to forget about Liverpool's fixture list\nFootball Daily podcast: Pep pressure, Wagner walks, unromantic O'Neill and casual Pellegrini\nCity initially failed to take advantage of their extra man and were given a scare when Diogo Jota narrowly failed to turn in Jonny's cross on a rare foray forward by the visitors.\nThat woke them from their slumbers and moments later they extended their lead from the spot.\nRyan Bennett sent Raheem Sterling tumbling as he burst into the box and Jesus stepped up to take his personal tally to seven in City's past three matches and put his side in complete control by half-time.\nThe only question left at the break was how many more City would score. Pep Guardiola's side had got five goals in the second half against Burton in the Carabao Cup and four against Rotherham in the FA Cup but had to settle for one this time.\nSubstitute Kevin de Bruyne whipped in a cross from a short corner routine, and Conor Coady could only deflect it into his own net to complete a miserable night for the visitors.\nCity just shy of record\nCity ended the night pushing for more goals but ended the evening one short of 100 in all competitions for the season.\nIt meant they missed out on equalling the record they set themselves in 2013-14 for being the fastest team to that landmark in the Premier League era but, other than their league position, that is just about the only thing they can be disappointed about at the moment.\nThey are the highest scorers in the Premier League with 59, and this was another message to Liverpool - who they beat here at the start of the year - that the title race is very much on.\nTuesday will mark a month since City last topped the table, and will also see Liverpool overhaul them as the team to have spent the longest at the summit this season - with the Reds leading the way with 75 days to City's 74.\nAnd, on the evidence of this latest relentless attacking display, Guardiola's side have the firepower to keep the pressure on the leaders.\nWolves forced into damage limitation\nThe first points that City dropped this season came in an enthralling 1-1 draw at Molineux in August, and Nuno Espirito Santo has shown that was no fluke with his side's subsequent results against Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Liverpool.\nOn this occasion, however, Wolves were unable to lay a finger on City, especially once Boly had been dismissed - and they struggled to get a touch on the ball too.\nThey played only 271 passes to 870 by the defending champions, and very few of them were in the City half.\nA fourth-minute header by the French defender that looped harmlessly wide was Wolves' sole effort at goal in the 90 minutes, and they only managed five touches in the City box.\nWolves continued to work hard, and restrict City's chances, but it was clear this was an exercise in damage limitation and they will have to wait a little longer for their first points of the new year.\nMan of the match - Gabriel Jesus\n'It is not easy even with one more player' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"They defend deep with 10 men so it is not easy even with one more player. We have to be more aggressive to put the ball in the box. Kevin [de Bruyne] came on and crossed the ball 10 times.\n\"That is the way we have to play [in that situation]. If it is pass, pass, pass it is more difficult.\"\nOn Gabriel Jesus' form: \"It is important for the striker [to score goals]. The first goal was an incredible pass from Aymeric Laporte and movement from Leroy.\"\nSpeaking to Match of the Day, Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo said: \"Not only the red card changed the game, but the way we conceded with a long pass. The red card makes the task much harder.\n\"You know it is difficult to stop them but you try to avoid certain situations and it was a 30-yard pass so we must improve. But you do not make a game plan with one less man.\n\"You have to stay in the game and work yourself to the end, and my boys did that so we must look ahead and the next challenge is at home now.\"\nMonday blues for Wolves - the stats\nManchester City have lost just one of their last 15 Premier League games at the Etihad (W13 D1 L1), a 3-2 defeat against Crystal Palace in December.\nWolves have lost eight of their last nine top-flight games played on Monday (W1), including all four such games in the Premier League.\nMan City are unbeaten in their last 35 Premier League games at the Etihad against promoted sides (W31 D4), since a 2-0 defeat against Reading back in February 2007.\nManchester City have lost none of the 20 Premier League games in which Gabriel Jesus has scored (W19 D1), winning each of the last 17.\nGabriel Jesus has scored 12 goals in his last eight appearances for Man City in all competitions at the Etihad Stadium.\nSince the start of last season, Man City's Leroy Sane has provided 23 Premier League assists, five more than any other player in that period.\nDavid Silva made his 267th Premier League appearance for Manchester City, overtaking Joe Hart (266) as City's all-time leading appearance maker in the competition.\nWilly Boly is the first Wolves player to be sent off in a Premier League game since Sebastien Bassong versus Arsenal in April 2012.\nWolves failed to land a single shot on target in a Premier League game for the first time since May 2012 against Everton.\nWhat next?\nWolves are at home to Leicester on Saturday (12:30 GMT KO). Manchester City travel to face Huddersfield Town on Sunday (13:30 GMT) in the first game since the Terriers parted company with manager David Wagner."

        "article_text": "Wolves 4-3 Leicester: Nuno Espirito Santo sent off for Jurgen Klopp-style celebration\nWhen Diogo Jota completed his hat-trick in injury time to earn Wolves a thrilling 4-3 win over Leicester, manager Nuno Espirito Santo raced down the touchline to join in the celebrations.\nIt was not the first time we have seen an exuberant on-pitch managerial show of emotion this season. Jurgen Klopp against Everton, anyone?\nBut this time there was a very different outcome, despite the offence - and even the referee - being the same.\nNuno was sent off by official Chris Kavanagh, the referee who did not dismiss Klopp after he raced on to the pitch at Anfield to celebrate Divock Origi's injury-time winner in the Merseyside derby in December.\nKlopp subsequently accepted a Football Association charge and was fined \u00a38,000, saying: \"That's what rules are for. I couldn't avoid it.\"\nAfter that match, referees were reminded about enforcing the technical area code of conduct - managers coming on to the pitch can be seen as inflammatory by the opposition and therefore doing so is prohibited. The Premier League bosses themselves were given a presentation about touchline behaviour before the season started.\nLike Klopp, Nuno said the emotion of the late winner got the better of him.\n\"I tried to avoid going inside the pitch but it is clear,\" he told Match of the Day. \"I was sent off for it and it is the right decision.\"\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, he added: \"I was sent off and rightly so. You cannot go on the pitch. I tried but someone saw me!\"\n'You feel like the greatest man in the world'\nThe game was a thriller - and the ending did not disappoint.\nWolves were 2-0 up early on, through Jota's volley and Ryan Bennett's header, only for Leicester to equalise within six minutes of the break through Demarai Gray and a Conor Coady own goal.\nJota's second restored the lead midway through the second half, only for Wes Morgan to head in what seemed to be a dramatic equaliser with three minutes left.\nBut then, having already missed one chance in injury time, Jota produced a precise finish to claim all three points and take Wolves above their opponents in the Premier League.\n\"In a game like this when you win you feel like the greatest man in the world,\" said Jota.\n\"This is the kind of game I watched as a kid and now I am a part of it.\"\nJota hat-trick as Wolves beat Leicester in seven-goal thriller\nMore misery for under-pressure Puel\nFor Leicester manager Claude Puel - already under pressure from some fans who question the team's style of play - the result was a painful one.\n\"It was an unbelievable game,\" said the Foxes boss. \"I think we have a lot of different feelings in this game. We started with poor intentions and conceded two early goals.\n\"It was crazy, we came back into the game with good quality and good chances. We lacked quality in our play but we came back with fantastic spirit in the second half. We had desire, aggression and put Wolves under pressure.\n\"We didn't manage the game at the end and we were naive in our goals and our management of the game.\n\"This game is finished at 3-3 - we needed to keep our position without trying to score another goal because there was a lot of tiredness. It was a fantastic feeling to come back and of course it is a big disappointment at the end.\"\nLeicester captain Wes Morgan added: \"There were a few strong words said at half time and as a team we expect better from ourselves.\n\"We knew if we got one goal, we could get another. At 2-2 either team could have come away with the points, and at 3-3 we thought it was the end of the game.\n\"It's a great game from a neutral point of view, seven goals and plenty of action and drama - but for us to come away with nothing is hard to take.\""

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-1 Brighton: Sixth straight Premier League win for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer became the first Manchester United manager to win his first six league games in charge as his side held on to beat Brighton.\nIt was United's seventh straight win since the Norwegian took over at Old Trafford on an interim basis a month ago and they are now just three points off fourth-placed Chelsea, who lost to Arsenal in Saturday's late kick-off.\nPaul Pogba put United in front after winning and then converting a penalty in the 27th minute.\nMarcus Rashford doubled the lead just before half-time with a beautiful solo goal on his 150th appearance for the club.\nPascal Gross halved the deficit for the visitors when he scored in off the bar with just over 20 minutes remaining.\nBrighton improved in the second half but their wretched away record continued as they fell to a fifth defeat in their last eight Premier League games.\nRelive Man Utd's victory\n'Rashford can be best striker in league with Harry Kane out injured'\nReaction from all six 15:00 GMT kick-offs in the Premier League\nHow does Rashford compare to Kane, Rooney, Ronaldo and Owen\nUnited's winning streak continues\nThe last time these sides met was in August, when United's season under Jose Mourinho began unravelling with a 3-2 defeat.\nBut United's first-half performance at Old Trafford on Saturday was worlds apart from that game last summer.\nSolskjaer almost had the luxury of naming an unchanged line-up for back-to-back league games for the first time since December 2017, but Luke Shaw fell ill in the warm-up and Diogo Dalot took his place.\nUnited put Brighton under relentless pressure from the off and deservedly took the lead.\nNemanja Matic's cross-field pass found Pogba, whose first touch took him past Gaetan Bong and the defender then clumsily nudged him over.\nThe Frenchman's stuttering penalty run-up has not completely disappeared, but this was nowhere near as long as his 26-step effort against Everton back in October and he slotted his shot past David Button.\nRashford's recent goalscoring form continued as he got his ninth of the season and his fifth under Solskjaer.\nThe England striker was played in by Dalot, sent Gross the wrong way and then bent his shot into the top corner.\nRashford was excellent for the first hour, spraying passes about with confidence and whipping in a stunning cross for Jesse Lingard, who prodded wide when he really should have scored.\nThey should have had more to show from their 20 attempts, but only five were on target, with Pogba and Anthony Martial guilty of missing chances.\nUnited eased off in the final 20 minutes, lacking sharpness and became sloppy as they missed out on a fourth clean sheet in a row.\n\"Today we were tested,\" said Solskjaer. \"I didn't think we played the game out as we should have. That's perhaps the next challenge for the boys.\n\"Sometimes you make it hard work. I thought we played some greats stuff at times. At the start of the second half we could have finished the game with great chances.\n\"The last 20 minutes we were in trouble. You can't always play fantasy football. At times we did and it's a great three points.\"\nMore away day blues for Brighton\nChris Hughton's side have won eight points away from the Amex Stadium this season and have just four away wins since joining the Premier League last season.\nThey particularly struggle against the top sides Following last week's defeat by Liverpool and Saturday's loss at Old Trafford, they have now lost all nine of their Premier League away games against 'big six' sides by an aggregate score of 19-2.\nThe first half against United proved damaging, as they rarely threatened and struggled to cope with the hosts' forward line.\nA double change on the hour mark with the introductions of Florin Andone and Anthony Knockaert provided the attacking impetus the Seagulls needed.\nDavy Propper did well to create Gross' goal, flicking a pass with the outside of his boot over the head of Victor Lindelof to the German, who chested it down and fired his shot off the bar and in.\nBrighton finished the stronger, their attacks and crosses sparking panic in the United team, but it came too late.\n\"The biggest disappointment is the goals we conceded,\" said Hughton. \"I thought we very much gave them a game.\n\"We will need lots of that come the end of the season but I thought there was a chance for us today.\n\"We needed a bit more quality in the final third and in general.\"\nAsked about bringing players in January, he added: \"You can never say never but I don't think it will be the case. Possibly one or two will be going out on loan.\"\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford\nOn Rashford's form, Solskjaer said: \"What a finish. That was the first thing I said to him when I met him. He had missed some chances and I said 'no problem, you'll be all right, just settle down a little bit'.\"\nPogba equals best goals return - the best stats\nSolskjaer is just the third manager in Premier League history to win his first six games in charge of a club, after Carlo Ancelotti with Chelsea and Pep Guardiola with Manchester City\nUnited have won more penalties (seven) while Brighton have conceded more (also seven) than any other Premier League side this season\nPogba's goal was his eighth in the Premier League this season, equalling his best return in a single season in the top five European leagues (also eight with Juventus in 2014-15 and 2015-16).\nRashford has now scored in his last four Premier League games. Only Anthony Martial (five) has had a better such run in the competition this season\nWhat's next?\nUnited travel to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday (19:55 GMT), a game that is live on BBC One. They then host Burnley in the league on 29 January.\nBrighton are also in cup action and host Championship side West Brom on Saturday (15:00 GMT). The Seagulls then travel to Premier League strugglers Fulham on 29 January."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 3-0 Cardiff City: Fabian Schar double helps secure win\nNewcastle lifted themselves out of the relegation zone and leapfrogged Cardiff as they secured a much-needed win over Neil Warnock's side.\nFabian Schar proved the difference as his first Newcastle goals lifted the gloom around St James' Park where Rafael Benitez's team have already lost eight times in the league this season.\nThe Swiss defender was only in the side to replace the injured Ciaran Clark but he took full advantage midway through the first when he was allowed to run from the right touchline before curling left-footed into the bottom corner.\nAs fine a goal as it was, the Cardiff defending was non-existent.\nSchar's second was more straightforward as he found himself in the right spot to bundle in Matt Ritchie's corner, becoming the first Newcastle defender to score two goals in a game since Philippe Albert in 1996.\nAyoze Perez added gloss in injury time from Salomon Rondon's low cross as Newcastle scored three goals for the first time in the league this season.\nVictory ended a five-game winless run for the Magpies and lifted them two points clear of their opponents, who only have Fulham and Huddersfield beneath them.\nFollow all the reaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nRe-live Newcastle's victory\nSchar shines in superb team display\nBenitez targeted this game against one of their relegation rivals as a crucial one and his team seemed to rise to the occasion with stellar performances all over the pitch.\nThis was a seventh game unbeaten against teams from the bottom seven.\nSchar's goals were as well taken as they were unexpected, but there were fine displays from the likes of academy graduate Sean Longstaff in midfield and Rondon, who was a true workhorse in attack.\nThe Magpies also added a threat down the flanks that Cardiff struggled to deal with as Ritchie and Christian Atsu combined down the left, with DeAndre Yedlin offering a constant outlet on the right.\nSchar's opener also came from that flank as he operated on the right side of a back three and was willing to break forward before calmly slotting past Neil Etheridge.\nFresh from a midweek FA Cup replay win at Blackburn, the home fans knew they were witnessing something special in the context of this season when Schar added his second. It was only the second time Newcastle had scored two home goals in a match this season.\nThe players, too, seemed to be lifted as they found an extra yard of pace and defended superbly as Cardiff finally stirred.\nAnd when Perez popped up with a third, his fourth of the season, it gave them hope that despite ongoing issues around the ownership of the club, they might yet see Premier League football again next season.\nCardiff struggle without injured captain Morrison\nCardiff came into the game in better form than their opponents, having lost only once in the past four games, with three clean sheets in the process.\nThey were also boosted by the loan signing of striker Oumar Niasse, who joined the club from Everton on Friday.\nBut with only 10 minutes in the Premier League since September, he struggled to fit into the team, which was perhaps understandable.\nThe Bluebirds, who had not won a league game at St James' Park since 1963, were also without captain Sean Morrison, who suffered a burst appendix earlier in the week.\nHis omission was important as the defence struggled to marshal the impressive Rondon.\nOnly Victor Camarasa managed a shot on goal in the first half, as he fizzed the ball over from 25 yards just before the break.\nAnd it was only after Newcastle went 2-0 up that the visitors attacked with any urgency. Bobby Reid skewed wide late on, but Warnock's team did not look very threatening in attack and were met with some stubborn resistance.\nMan of the match - Fabian Schar\nManager reaction\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"We did good. We scored three goals so everyone has to be happy.\n\"The main thing is the commitment of the players and then it was about trying to manage the game against a tough team, a physical team.\n\"Fabian Schar has quality on the ball. It [his first goal] was a great goal. The team were giving everything and this kind of game you know you have to work hard.\n\"I said before we would still have to win a lot of games to stay up.\"\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock: \"I didn't think it was a 3-0 game. I couldn't see them breaking through until the first goal which was poor from our point of view. We started the second half well and were dangerous and then conceded the second that killed us. We didn't have anything drop for us and they were better than us in the final third.\n\"Nine of the lads that played today were in the Championship last year. While we are disappointed it is not the end of the world. We looked a half decent side. I didn't think in the last third we did enough.\"\nFirst Newcastle defender to score twice since Philippe Albert\nNewcastle have won their last 10 home league games against Cardiff - only against Bolton have they had a longer run in their history (11 between 1898 and 1914).\nCardiff have failed to score in a league-high 11 different Premier League games this season.\nFabian Schar scored both of Newcastle's goals in this match, his first ever goals in the Premier League. He'd scored just three goals in his previous 65 appearances in the top five European leagues.\nEach of Ayoze Perez's last five Premier League goals for Newcastle have come at St James' Park.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle will hope they can continue their good form against Watford in the FA Cup fourth round next Saturday (15:00 GMT) before they host Manchester City in the league the following Tuesday (20:00 GMT). Cardiff take a trip to Arsenal on the same evening (19:45 GMT)."

It's a real reward for the players' mindsets during this difficult run we've had. It's been incredibly hard but they've not let their heads drop and they've trained well.\n\"I was so keen for everyone to feel that winning feeling again off the back of everyone sticking together. Performance-wise, today maybe wasn't as good as some of the games we lost recently, but we defended very well after Callum's great strike.\n\"Callum is very much a team player. He's a vital part of what we do here and he knew how important the game was for us as a group. He delivered a very good display.\"\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini:\n\"Of course we are disappointed about the result. It was a very close game in the first 45 minutes, and in the second half we had a clear opportunity to score the first goal.\n\"We didn't and then they scored a beautiful goal, but one which had a lot of luck too because the rebound came in exactly the position for their player to shoot.\n\"Andy [Carroll] had a very clear chance, but he has had a long time without playing and it is not easy for a player to recover immediately.\n\"He is working hard and I'm sure that he will improve game-by-game.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, 26 January (19:45 GMT) before a trip to Wolves in the Premier League three days later (19:45 GMT).\nBournemouth, out of the Cup, are next in action on Wednesday, 30 January when they host Chelsea in the Premier League (19:45 GMT)."

The energy and the edge we play with as a group is coming back but those extra two points would have been very welcome. Unfortunately a big decision has gone against us.\n\"VAR is a definite for me. I know it needs to be made better but they are two big points. We haven't always had the right decisions go our way, and we are 65 Premier League games without a penalty which is an anomaly.\n\"They started well win the first 10 minutes but we played well. Ben [Foster] is a good keeper and Tom [Heaton] has done really well, and the team is operating really well in front of him. The spine of our team is very good and we are looking a strong outfit.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia said:\n\"I think today it wasn't our best game but it was positive to get a point. We tried to win the game and were looking for different options to attack.\n\"We created chances, the first one with Gerard Deulofeu at the beginning of the game, and we created two more in the first half but I think the goalkeepers were everywhere today.\"\nOn Wood's offside goal: \"I didn't see but I have listened and I have nothing to say. I always support and respect the referee's decisions.\"\nGoalless draw ends Vicarage Road record - the stats\nThis was the 20th league meeting between Watford and Burnley at Vicarage Road but the first one to end goalless.\nWatford have lost just one of their last eight Premier League games (W3 D4).\nBurnley kept their first league clean sheet away to Watford in 10 matches.\nBurnley have gone four Premier League games unbeaten for the first time since a run of six ending in April 2018.\nThis was just Burnley's second clean sheet in the Premier League in their last 11 away games in the competition.\nWatford have won just one of their last six Premier League games on home soil (D2 L3).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Manchester City in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 26 January (15:00 GMT), while Watford visit Newcastle in the same competition at the same time."

Even after Liverpool went ahead, Zaha and Patrick van Aanholt continued to be a nuisance for their defence and Tomkins' goal was a just reward for their resilience.\nHodgson made three substitutions in quick succession as Palace searched for an equaliser after Salah's second, with one of them, Jeffrey Schlupp, going close from a Van Aanholt free-kick.\nLiverpool last conceded three goals at home in the league almost exactly a year ago when they beat Manchester City 4-3\nEven Meyer's late strike - his first in a Palace shirt - proved not to be enough as Liverpool continued their journey towards the title despite conceding three at home in the league for the first time since a 4-3 win over Manchester City on 14 January 2018.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson (Liverpool)\nLiverpool bring up their 1,000 - match stats\nCrystal Palace are the first Premier League team to score more than once at Anfield since February 2018, when Tottenham drew 2-2 with Liverpool.\nLiverpool hit the 1,000 goal mark in home games in the Premier League, becoming only the third side to do so after Manchester United and Chelsea.\nCrystal Palace keeper Julian Speroni (39 years 246 days) became the oldest player to make a Premier League appearance this season, and the oldest to appear in the competition since Shay Given (40 years 151 days) in September 2016.\nWilfried Zaha's assist for Palace's opener was his first goal involvement in his past 14 league games.\nPalace's Andros Townsend scored his fourth league goal of the season, equalling his best in a Premier League campaign (also four in 2015-16).\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah scored his 50th Premier League goal in his 72nd appearance in the competition - only Andrew Cole (65), Alan Shearer (66) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (68) have reached the milestone in fewer appearances.\nSince Jurgen Klopp took over at Liverpool in October 2015, Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in 69 Premier League goals, more than any other player for the Reds (45 goals, 24 assists).\nJames Milner picked up his second red card for Liverpool in the league. He was also sent off against Crystal Palace in March 2016 after fouling Wilfried Zaha.\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane has scored in his past four Premier League games against Palace, the first time he has netted four in a row against one opponent in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nNext weekend sees the FA Cup return so Liverpool, having been knocked out in the third round, now have a 10-day break before hosting Leicester in the league on Wednesday, 30 January (20:00 GMT kick-off).\nPalace host Premier League rivals Tottenham in the FA Cup next Sunday (16:00) before travelling to Southampton in the league on 30 January (19:45)."

We gave two chances away but had a lot of chances to score, it could have been four or five.\"\nWhile Southampton had dominated the first period it took a superb 20-yard effort from James Ward-Prowse, which found the top corner, to confirm their superiority and illuminate proceedings.\nLucas Digne's toe-poke past his own goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, summed up a miserable afternoon for the visitors who had travelled to the south coast hoping to earn a first league double over Southampton since 2001-02.\nWhile Gylfi Sigurdsson's late effort into the bottom left corner briefly gave them hope of retrieving a point, Marco Silva's side generally toiled in attack.\nAnd they were fortunate that Saints, who twice hit the post in the first period, did not win by an even greater margin.\nThe result moves Southampton up to 15th, three points clear of the relegation zone, with Everton remaining 11th.\nWard-Prowse & Redmond star for revitalised Saints\nHaving been on a winless stretch for 11 matches, there is now a buoyancy to Southampton's play that had been absent prior to Hasenhuttl taking charge.\nThis victory though, which marked the second occasion they have won consecutive matches under the Austrian, was the perfect boost before a sequence of crucial matches against clubs around them in the table.\nWith a trip to Burnley sandwiched between home games with Crystal Palace and Cardiff, they can enter that period with the confidence that their new approach is working.\n\"The guys really showed they are focused and committed and that is the key for the future, 11 players going in the same direction,\" Hasenhuttl added.\n\"We have very important games in January and February, they are the most important months - if you do it well you have a big chance to leave the relegation zone.\"\nThe form of James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond is central to that, with both appearing revitalised under new management.\nWard-Prowse, who barely featured in the first four months of the season, bombed forward at every opportunity from midfield, covering more ground and having more shots than any other home player (3).\nHis reward was a fine individual goal, while Redmond's pace - coupled with that of the returning on-loan Liverpool forward Danny Ings - caused chaos in the Everton defence throughout.\nIngs was unfortunate to see Pickford save a powerful first-half volley after he had raced behind the Everton rearguard, but in the second period a similar run by Redmond brought Digne's own-goal.\nEverton faltering as best of the rest?\nWith an 11-point gap separating Everton from Arsenal, a top six place appears to be disappearing over the horizon for Marco Silva's side.\nHowever, they remain only three points adrift of seventh-placed Watford and have, despite changing managers seven times in the last decade, displayed consistency in finishing eighth or better in seven of those seasons.\nThat now appears to be the immediate challenge facing Silva, rather than transforming his side initially into one that can compete for a top-four place - and beyond that, for the Premier League title.\nOn this evidence, though, improvements are required across the board. Defensively stretched throughout, Everton's midfield - particularly Idrissa Gueye, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Andre Gomes - was culpable for misplacing too many passes.\nAnd while that did not allow them to build a platform to attack, another recurring complaint among Everton supporters is the club's failure to recruit a central striker to adequately replace Romelu Lukaku - the first Everton player to score over 20 league goals in a season since Gary Lineker (1985-86).\nWhile 21-year-old Brazilian Richarlison has managed nine goals this term, he struggled to get involved in the game as a centre forward and was withdrawn after 65 minutes.\nOnly the introduction of two more conventional centre forwards, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Cenk Tosun, allowed Everton to exert any attacking pressure as they pulled a goal back in the closing stages.\n\"First-half we didn't create at all, we were faster second-half and more aggressive with fast decisions. Then their goal changes the game,\" Silva said.\n\"When you lose like we lost this afternoon we are not happy, we didn't perform well and they deserved three points.\"\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nEverton's away day blues - the stats\nSouthampton have won five of their last six home league games against Everton, losing only in August 2015 (0-3).\nSouthampton have won more Premier League games under Ralph Hasenhuttl (4 in 8) than they did with Mark Hughes (3 in 22).\nEverton have lost four of their last five away games in the Premier League (W1).\nSouthampton's James Ward-Prowse has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career.\nEverton's Gylfi Sigurdsson has ended on the losing side in four games in which he's scored in the Premier league this term, a league-high.\nSouthampton have won two of their last four Premier League games at St. Mary's, as many as they'd won in their previous 20.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton resume their Premier League duties on Wednesday, 30 January (19:45 GMT) when Crystal Palace visit St. Mary's. Everton travel to Millwall in the fourth round of the FA Cup next Saturday, 26 January (17:30 GMT) before visiting Huddersfield in the Premier League on Tuesday, 29 January (19:45 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-0 Chelsea: Alexandre Lacazette and Laurent Koscielny score in important win\nArsenal earned an important win in a pulsating London derby against Chelsea to keep themselves in the race for the Premier League top four.\nThe victory moves the Gunners to within three points of fourth-placed Chelsea and back above Manchester United, who had gone fifth by beating Brighton.\nAlexandre Lacazette put Arsenal ahead in the 14th minute when he made the most of a poor Hector Bellerin cross with a fine first touch before turning and beating Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga at his near post with a fierce strike.\nArsenal's intense pressing hampered Chelsea's ability to play the ball from the back, particularly in the first half, and the Gunners deservedly added a second through captain Laurent Koscielny in the 39th minute.\nChelsea failed to mark well enough at another set-piece and Koscielny missed a free header but the ball fortuitously looped in off his shoulder.\nMaurizio Sarri's Chelsea struggled to create in the first half but did hit the post on the stroke of half-time through Marcos Alonso's header at a corner.\nThey posed greater threat in the second half but failed to have a shot on target until the 82nd minute as Arsenal's defence, led by the excellent Koscielny, held firm.\nReaction to Arsenal v Chelsea\nSarri says Chelsea players are 'very difficult to motivate'\nArsenal show there is life in Emery's debut season\nArsenal and Chelsea both appointed new managers in the summer and both came into the game at the Emirates with questions marks over their progress after difficult recent results.\nArsenal had lost four of their last eight games, having been unbeaten in their previous 22, while Chelsea had only won four of their last seven games.\nDefeat to the Blues would have seen a seven-point gap open between the Gunners and the top four but their intensity and work-rate in the early stages put their opponents on the back foot from the outset.\nArsenal seemed to have been set up with a clear plan by manager Unai Emery to press high up the pitch to prevent Chelsea playing from the back.\nTheir intensity was made clear on two occasions in the first half when striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang twice ran back into his own half to make challenges.\nArsenal should have scored as early as the fourth minute when Bellerin played in Lacazette who then crossed for Aubameyang, but the Gabon international failed to make contact with his finish from inside the area.\nBoth of Arsenal's goals came from set-pieces, another area that looked to have been worked on pre-match, and Koscielny could have scored earlier than he did but put a free header straight at Arrizabalaga at another.\nAaron Ramsey is set to leave Arsenal on a free transfer in the summer but started as the most attacking player in Arsenal's midfield and he played a key role both going forward and leading the north Londoners' press.\nHe constantly hassled Chelsea's Jorginho - a key player in the Blues' creativity - and no player had covered more ground than the Welshman when he was substituted in the 67th minute.\nThe only down side to Arsenal's night was what looked to be a serious injury to right-back Hector Bellerin who went down clutching his knee despite there being no contact in the challenge.\nChelsea's need for a central striker laid bare\nFor Chelsea the problems are familiar ones which have been apparent in the Blues' matches in recent weeks.\nSarri's side scored 27 times in their opening 11 league matches this season but have netted just 13 times in their subsequent 13 outings.\nEden Hazard was again played in a false nine role but dropped deeper and deeper in search of the ball before eventually Olivier Giroud was introduced as a central striker in the 68th minute and the Belgian was able to play from a wider position.\nChelsea had 64% possession but failed to create any clear opportunities from open play with their passing and build-up too slow. Their one shot on target came from Alonso from a tight angle on the left-side of the box and was easily parried away from Bernd Leno.\nThe Blues often worked the ball into wide areas 30 yards from goal but they had too few players in the box and were crowded out by Arsenal's impressive defence.\nKoscielny repeatedly cut out crosses and both he and fellow centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who had one of his best games since joining Arsenal last summer, headed away any high balls.\nChelsea have been heavily linked with a move for Juventus striker Gonzalo Higuain, currently on loan at Juventus, who Sarri worked with at his former club Napoli and on this evidence some increased attacking potency is clearly needed.\nMan of the match - Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal)\n'We can be optimistic' - manager reaction\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"I'm very pleased with this victory and these three points. After our defeat at West Ham we needed to show our supporters a strong moment.\n\"I think we can improve. We can be optimistic in the future but we need to find a good balance between when we're playing away and when we're playing at home. We can be optimistic because we are closer to a lot of teams like Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United.\n\"I'm very happy with the last 20 minutes and how we defended against them. The first half made the difference with the result, but in the second half we showed how we can defend together.\"\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri: \"I'm disappointed and I'm angry. I was disappointed with our mental approach more than anything else.\n\"From a mental point of view we suffered a similar kind of approach against Tottenham Hotspur. I thought that we'd overcome that, but it would now appear that there's still a great deal of work to do to be able to get these players truly motivated and up for playing these games.\n\"I think particularly in the first half our pressing wasn't good enough. We didn't press far enough up the pitch and I think there was a definite lack of determination, particularly in our own penalty area. The first goal was a pretty massive example of how we lacked determination.\"\nOpposing derby fortunes - the best stats\nArsenal have won consecutive home games against Chelsea in all competitions for the first time since February 2004.\nChelsea have only won one of their last seven away London derbies in the Premier League (D2 L4), winning 1-0 at Crystal Palace in December.\nArsenal are unbeaten in 13 Premier League London derby matches at home (W10 D3), winning the last six in a row.\nArsenal have won more points in seven games against 'big six' sides this season (8) than they did in the whole of the 2017-18 campaign (6).\nChelsea's first shot on target didn't come until the 82nd minute, from Marcos Alonso.\n63% of Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette's Premier League goals this season have come in London derbies (5/8).\nOnly Arsenal team-mate Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (6) has scored more Premier League London derby goals this season than Lacazette.\nLaurent Koscielny became the first Arsenal defender to score 20 Premier League goals. The Frenchman has scored in each of his nine campaigns in the competition - only Dennis Bergkamp (11), Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott (10 each) have scored in more for the Gunners.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal's next fixture is in the FA Cup fourth round against Manchester United at home on 25 January (19:55 GMT) live on BBC One. The Gunners' next league game is at the Emirates against Cardiff on Tuesday, 29 January (19:45 GMT).\nChelsea have their Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Tottenham on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) as they look to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit. They then play Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup on 27 January before returning to league action on 30 January with a trip to Bournemouth."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield 0-3 Man City: Champions ease past managerless Terriers\nManchester City scored their 100th goal of the season as they eased past managerless Huddersfield to move back to four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.\nDavid Wagner left the Terriers by mutual consent on Monday with the club bottom of the league, leaving coach Mark Hudson temporarily in charge.\nCity, who had netted 19 goals in their past three games, were not at their free-scoring best in the first half at the John Smith's Stadium.\nBut the defending champions went ahead in the 18th minute when Danilo's long-range effort deflected in off the head of Christopher Schindler.\nThe visitors then struck twice in two minutes after the break to put the game to bed, with Leroy Sane creating the first and scoring the second.\nFirst, the Germany forward whipped in a cross for Raheem Sterling to dive and head in his 12th goal of the season.\nThen Sergio Aguero cushioned a header for Sane to run on to and finish past Jonas Lossl.\nIt was not a vintage display by Pep Guardiola's side but they remain in title contention.\nBorussia Dortmund coach Jan Siewert has been approached by Huddersfield for the vacant job, but he will face a mammoth task to keep them in the top flight if he takes over.\nThis was their ninth defeat in 10 league games and the result leaves the Terriers bottom of the table and 10 points from safety.\nReaction after Man City win at Huddersfield\nCity get the job done\nWith Liverpool edging a seven-goal thriller against Crystal Palace on Saturday, City's mission in Yorkshire was simply to win and stay in touch.\nGuardiola tweaked his line-up with Gabriel Jesus, who had scored seven goals in his past three games, dropped to the bench in favour of Aguero, who made his first start since the 2-1 win over Liverpool on 3 January.\nCity should have been awarded a penalty in the 13th minute when Terence Kongolo went into the back of Sterling.\nDanilo's goal lifted a sloppy first half during which even Kevin de Bruyne, usually so assured in possession, was wasteful.\nThat was City's 100th in all competitions this season - and they are the first side in Europe's top five leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) to reach the landmark.\nBar the two-goal burst, the visitors were nowhere near their attacking best, even when the two Silvas - Bernardo and David - came on in the second half.\nAguero barely threatened and only managed one shot, a half chance in the first half.\nIt was not the demolition many had predicted but ultimately it was mission accomplished for City, who have now scored 23 goals without reply and not conceded for 386 minutes.\n\"The way we played we didn't deserve more than three goals,\" said Guardiola. \"We will improve in the future.\n\"What we have done so far has been incredible, in the league and the Carabao Cup. We have an incredible number of points. But this game can teach us and show what we have to do to improve.\n\"We've scored a lot of goals. So far, so good. One team has been better but we're in January and there are many more games to play. We have to focus on what we have to do.\n\"If Liverpool win, we have to win. And if Liverpool lose, then we also have to win.\"\nGoals a priority for new manager\nWagner's name was sung by the home fans and banners paid tribute to the man who brought Premier League football to the club.\nHis temporary replacement Hudson was facing a daunting challenge in what may be his only match in charge, but he can feel some relief to have restricted the league's top scorers to just three goals.\nThe 36-year-old former defender put his own stamp on the team and made six changes to the XI who started Wagner's final game, a 0-0 draw with Cardiff.\nBut the line-up did not scream goals for a team who are the lowest scorers in the Premier League this season and have now only netted 18 in their past 37 matches in all competitions.\nFormer Monaco striker Adama Diakhaby started up top but he is yet to score this term, while on-loan Montpellier forward Isaac Mbenza is also goalless.\nCity keeper Ederson made just two saves, one in each half.\nSubstitute Steve Mounie had three chances late on, first shooting just wide, then heading at Ederson, and finally scooping a close-range effort wide with the last play of the match.\nSo goals will be top of the new manager's in-tray, as will be improving the side's dreadful home record. They have the worst in the league with just one win at the John Smith's this season.\n\"We stuck to the gameplan,\" said Hudson. \"If it wasn't for the deflected goal I think we could have stayed in the longer. After that we were deflated, I could see that, but we fought to the end.\n\"It's been a tough week, saying goodbye to the boss [Wagner] after three and a half years. What he's created here has been nigh impossible.\"\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane\nCity's goal glut, Terriers struggles at home - the best stats\nSince losing 2-1 to Leicester City on 26 December, Manchester City have won their past six matches by an aggregate score of 27-2.\nHuddersfield Town have lost five consecutive home league matches for the first time since a run of seven between April and September 2000.\nSane has eight goals and 12 assists in his past 17 Premier League starts (eight goals, 12 assists).\nHuddersfield have won none of the 34 Premier League games in which they have conceded the first goal.\nSterling's past two Premier League goals have been headers - only one of his first 57 in the competition came via his head.\nSince the start of last season, Huddersfield have failed to score in 32 league matches - nine more than any other side.\nSane and Sterling have combined for six league goals for Manchester City this season - the only two players to combine for more are Bournemouth's Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser (seven goals).\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield, who are already out of the FA Cup, have a weekend off before hosting Everton in the league on 29 January.\nCity travel to Burton for the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday, leading 9-0 from the first game. Burnley then visit Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, before a league game at Newcastle on 29 January."

At the end we took a free-kick into the box. Why? We should have taken the ball into the corner.\n\"We played well and sooner or later we will find our way. We have to continue to believe. Now we have to stay together and I hope other players arrive to help us.\"\nWinks' last-gasp winner means third-placed Spurs have a seven-point cushion over Arsenal in fifth in the battle for Champions League places.\n\"Sometimes in football, it is not tactics or formation - you have to believe,\" said manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\"It was an unbelievable finish. That's why it is so important to believe.\"\nFulham had nine shots on goal in an impressive first half and took a deserved lead when Tottenham striker Fernando Llorente scored an own goal.\nThe Spaniard, making his first Premier League start of the season in place of the injured Harry Kane, inadvertently beat Hugo Lloris from close range while attempting to clear the danger inside his own six-yard box after a Jean Michael Seri corner.\nThe hosts thought they had doubled their lead five minutes before the interval but Aleksandar Mitrovic's header was ruled out as the Serbian was adjudged to be offside.\nHowever, Spurs responded in the second period and they drew level six minutes after the interval when Dele Alli ghosted in behind the Fulham defence to head a pin-point Christian Eriksen cross past Rico.\nAnd Winks completed the turnaround in stoppage time when he met substitute Georges-Kevin Nkoudou's cross to break Fulham's resistance.\nDele Alli adds to Spurs' growing injury list\nSpurs find a way despite Kane and Son's absence\nThe 50th meeting between these two London clubs saw Tottenham - the side with the best away record in the league - facing the division's worst defence.\nHowever, Spurs were without their two top goalscorers because of injury (Kane) and international commitments (Son Heung-min), and for 50 minutes, they looked devoid of ideas and opportunities to break down their well-organised opposition.\nPochettino's men had just four shots in the first half, which was less than half the number Fulham produced (nine).\nThe man chosen to play instead of talisman Kane made an impact at the wrong end and Son's replacement, Erik Lamela, only managed one shot at goal in the 79 minutes he was on the field.\nSpurs were better after the break as Eriksen's influence on the game began to grow, but when Llorente had a late chance to make amends for his earlier mistake, his header drifted wide with the game heading for a draw.\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Jermaine Jenas said: \"It's a big, big moment in Spurs' season. Everything was negative with regards to the players missing but they kept plugging away, they kept getting the ball into the box and it was one of their own in Harry Winks who saved the day today.\n\"They've got a lot of players to patch up and get out there for the next game but that will feel huge.\"\nBabel a cause of optimism for Fulham\nFulham's debutant winger Ryan Babel looked like he enjoyed his first Premier League start since December 2010, after completing a move from Turkish side Besiktas earlier this week.\nThe former Liverpool forward showed plenty of encouraging signs for the hosts and he should have scored in the 11th minute when he burst clear of Davinson Sanchez with pace and power, but his left-footed effort was well saved by Lloris.\nHe then came close to doubling Fulham's lead while they were in the ascendancy, but his header sailed over the bar after he rose highest to meet Cyrus Christie's cross.\nBabel last played for Besiktas on 22 December and he was replaced after 50 minutes, but the 32-year-old had more shots and played more key passes than any other Fulham player during the whole game.\nThe Netherlands international gives Claudio Ranieri's side an option they have not had so far.\nMan of the match - Harry Winks (Tottenham)\n'I hope it is not a massive problem' - what they said\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino to BBC Sport: \"The action is brilliant from Harry Winks, to recover the ball from a difficult position, he believes to score and arrive in the box. It was an amazing cross from Nkoudou.\n\"Some injuries appear in a period with a more busy schedule and another opportunity opens the door for players not consistently in the starting XI or on the bench. It is great opportunity for different players to show quality.\"\nOn Alli's injury: \"It is in the left hamstring, I hope it is not a massive problem, but we will need to assess.\"\nFulham boss Claudio Ranieri:\n\"Unbelievable.

He is very dangerous with the crosses into the box.\n\"We deserved to win and played very good football.\"\nThe victory lifts 19th-placed Fulham to within six points of safety, while Brighton stay in 13th.\nReaction to Tuesday's Premier League games\nBrighton fail to cope with Mitrovic\nRanieri said before the match that this was the sort of fixture Fulham had to win to maintain realistic hopes of avoiding an immediate return to the second tier.\nBut the Cottagers could hardly have made a worse start to proceedings as Brighton brutally exposed the hosts' defensive frailties inside the opening 20 minutes.\nFulham had managed just one shot on target in the first 45 minutes, but Chambers' first goal for the Londoners - a tremendous strike into the corner from the edge of the penalty area - changed the course of the game.\nMitrovic, who had failed to score since his last-minute winner against Huddersfield on 29 December, was a constant thorn in Brighton's side after half-time and put his side on course for an unlikely victory with a pair of trademark headers.\nThe former Newcastle man capitalised on some questionable Seagulls defending to nod home the equaliser, before heading Joe Bryan's exquisite cross past Mat Ryan to make it 3-2 after 74 minutes.\nVietto nodded in his first goal of the season to put the seal on what could prove to be a pivotal victory in Fulham's battle to avoid the drop.\nThey nearly made it five with eight minutes remaining, but Cairney struck the woodwork for the second time in a matter of minutes with a dipping drive from outside the area.\nMixed evening for Murray\nBrighton have fared no better than Fulham in recent weeks, with both sides registering only five points from a possible 24 in the run-up to Tuesday's meeting.\nThe Seagulls also went into the game with the worst away record outside the Premier League's bottom three, but they looked set to claim only their third win on the road this season after Murray's early brace.\nIt ended a run of eight league games without a goal for the 35-year-old striker, but the contest could have taken on an entirely different complexion had he taken one of several opportunities to complete his hat-trick either side of half-time.\nHe headed Gross's cross inches wide of the Sergio Rico's right-hand post late in the first half, before firing straight at Fulham's Spanish custodian from point-blank range moments later.\nMurray was thwarted again by Rico two minutes before Mitrovic's second goal, his flicked header from Montoya's delivery palmed to safety by the Cottagers' goalkeeper.\nVictory for Brighton would have lifted them 10 points clear of the bottom three with 14 games remaining, but their second-half capitulation leaves them seven points clear of the relegation places, and just four points off Southampton in 17th.\nMan of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham)\nMitrovic sets personal best - the stats\nFulham v Brighton is just the second match-up in Premier League history to see both sides come from two goals behind to avoid defeat in their two meetings within a season, after Blackburn Rovers v Bolton Wanderers in 2003-04.\nFulham came from behind in a Premier League game after being two or more goals down at half-time for the first time since 26 April 2008, when they beat Manchester City 3-2 away from home after being 0-2 behind at half-time.\nMurray's opening goal ended an eight-game run without a goal for Brighton & Hove Albion - his worst-ever run without a goal in the Premier League for the club.\nIn scoring the first goal of this game, Murray opened the scoring in a Premier League match for the sixth time this season - only Mohamed Salah (nine games) has done so more often than the Brighton and Hove Albion striker (level with Harry Kane).\nMurray's double saw him become the oldest player to score a brace in a Premier League game (35y 126d) since Frank Lampard for Chelsea v West Ham on 23 November 2013 (35y 156d).\nMitrovic has scored 10 Premier League goals in 2018-19, one more than his previous best tally within a season in the competition (nine in 2015-16 with Newcastle).\nMitrovic has now scored 20 Premier League goals - scoring five of those under Steve McClaren, five under Rafa Benitez, five under Slavisa Jokanovic and five under Ranieri.\nFulham 'a little more confident' - what the managers said\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I did not imagine this. It was great to score in the second half, and the reaction was unbelievable.\n\"Mitrovic is a goalscorer. He plays this way, covers the ball, fights for every ball and gives spirit to everybody.\n\"We know nothing is done, but we are a little more confident that something could happen.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton:\n\"As good as we were in the first half, we were equally as bad in the second half.\n\"We knew they would come out in the second half and go for it. We knew they would have good possession, but you've got to defend well in all of those situations.\n\"Once they got their first goal, that gave them some momentum. Once they got the second one, they were then in full flow.\n\"If you allow them the space and time to get the crosses in that they did, then you're asking for trouble. You're hoping that they don't show quality at the end of it, but unfortunately for us they did.\"\nWhat's next?\nFulham travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier league on Saturday, 2 February (15:00 GMT), while Brighton host Watford at the same time."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 0-1 Everton: Richarlison scores only goal\nHuddersfield Town boss Jan Siewert said he was \"disappointed but proud\" after his side lost to Everton in his first game in charge.\nRicharlison scored the only goal from a rebound in the third minute after his initial shot was saved to help lift some pressure on manager Marco Silva after the Toffees' FA Cup exit at Millwall on Saturday.\nEverton were down to 10 men for the final 24 minutes after substitute Lucas Digne brought down Adama Diakhaby, who was in on goal.\nAaron Mooy, returning from seven weeks out injured, had a shot saved from the free-kick, Huddersfield's first effort on target.\nTown - who are 11 points adrift of safety - pushed for an equaliser but Elias Kachunga's header was brilliantly saved by Jordan Pickford.\nFormer Borussia Dortmund reserves boss Siewert said: \"I saw why Pickford is England's number one with incredible saves.\n\"We shouldn't find excuses. We need to focus. It's a process which has started. I saw many things I implemented in training.\n\"The most important thing is we create chances and the goals will come. The lads got my ideas and we had chances.\"\nFollow reaction to Tuesday's games\nHuddersfield fail to take their chances\nThe Terriers will rue their failure to take advantage of their numerical advantage. They dominated possession in the second half, especially after Digne's sending off, but have now lost 11 of their past 12 games.\nThey may wonder what could have happened had Digne not brought down Diakhaby on the edge of the box with the forward through on goal - although the Frenchman has yet to score a goal for Huddersfield.\nThey had 10 shots, the same amount as the Toffees, but shooting has not been their problem this season; scoring has. Their shot conversion rate of 6.84% is the lowest in the Premier League. No other team are in single figures.\nThey have equalled a record for fewest top-flight goals after 13 home games - five, level with Arsenal in 1912-13. They only have 13 overall in their 24 league games.\nSiewert was managing Huddersfield for the first time, having replaced fellow German David Wagner, although he knows his side are likely to be Championship bound. However, Mooy's return from a knee injury will be a welcome boost for the west Yorkshire side and he helped set up an immediate chance with Kachunga heading over.\nKachunga had another much better header which was expertly saved, as Huddersfield's chance for a second point since November came and went.\nNot easy on the eye but Everton get job done\nToffees boss Silva desperately needed a win with his side picking up eight points in their previous 10 league games, the third worst run in the division.\nAnd that was before they were dumped out of the FA Cup by Championship side Millwall at the weekend.\nThey got the win at John Smith's Stadium, but had to grind it out with a less than stellar performance.\nRicharlison opened the scoring after 129 seconds at the second attempt from Tom Davies' cut-back. And Gylfi Sigurdsson forced two saves from Jonas Lossl from distance.\nThey only managed one shot on target after the break and just had to see the game out once Digne was dismissed for denying a very clear scoring opportunity. The French left-back had only been on the pitch for 11 minutes as a substitute for Leighton Baines, who picked up an injury on his first Premier League start since August.\nTurkish striker Cenk Tosun, who had a lively first half, was replaced by young full-back Jonjoe Kenny as Silva changed shape to make sure his side picked up only a third Premier League win since November.\nMidfielder Idrissa Gueye, who was the subject of a rejected bid by Paris St-Germain, missed the game, but Silva told BBC Sport that he had a minor groin problem and that there have been no new offers.\n'They didn't create anything more'\nEverton boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport: \"The main thing was to win, to do everything to get the three points. And to give a big answer to ourselves and our fans.\n\"Three points away from home and a clean sheet was important to boost our confidence. It was difficult with 10 men, having played a game on Saturday. They had 10 days to prepare. It was well deserved for our players.\n\"One free-kick, one header, but they didn't create anything more. Jordan did well in those two moments.\"\nMatch stats - longest goal drought since 2002\nHuddersfield are winless in their past 11 meetings with Everton (D5 L6), since a 1-0 win in March 1956\nEverton have kept a clean sheet in four of their past five top-flight meetings with Huddersfield\nEverton are unbeaten in their past 14 away Premier League games against sides starting the day bottom of the table (W7 D7), since a 2-1 defeat by Wolves in May 2004\nHuddersfield have failed to score in 50% of their home Premier League games (16/32) - the highest percentage in the competition's history\nHuddersfield have now failed to score in each of their past four games - the Terriers last went longer without finding the back of the net in October 2002 (run of five)\nLucas Digne's red card was Everton's third sending off of the season in the Premier League - only Leicester (four) have seen more players sent off in 2018-19\nRicharlison has scored 11 goals in all competitions for Everton this season, the same tally as Everton's top goalscorer in all competitions in 2017-18 (Wayne Rooney).\nMan of the match - Mathias Jorgensen (Huddersfield)\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield face a difficult challenge in Siewert's second game - away to Chelsea on Saturday (15:00 GMT). Everton host Wolves at the same time."

        "article_text": "Wolves 3-0 West Ham: Jimenez double sees off Hammers\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini claimed \"it is impossible to play worse\" following his side's abject display at Wolves.\nThe Hammers were convincingly swept aside by the hosts who climbed to seventh in the Premier League and could have recorded a greater margin of victory but for the heroics of visiting keeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nIt represented West Ham's third consecutive defeat and followed their embarrassing FA Cup exit at League One's bottom club AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.\n\"We were looking for a reaction after we lost against Wimbledon in the cup,\" Pellegrini said.\n\"We couldn't do it and we have to review all we are doing, because something we are doing is bad. No shots on target and we conceded three goals, so it is impossible to play worse.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves were imperious - carving out chance after chance before Romain Saiss finally opened the scoring midway through the second half with a powerful header past Fabianski from Joao Moutinho's corner.\nOn-loan Benfica forward Raul Jimenez took centre stage late on, flicking in a second from a Moutinho free-kick before rounding off the scoring with a deft chip over Fabianski.\n\"Raul is doing a fantastic job which goes beyond the goals he scores,\" said Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\"The way he plays, his combinations, the way he works, he doesn't stop - he is always giving us our first reaction to losing the ball. He has to keep on going.\"\nThe result allowed Wolves to complete their first ever league double over 11th-placed West Ham.\nWest Ham's Arnautovic leaves Molineux on crutches\nWolves dominate down the flanks\nWolves have shown themselves capable of brilliant and abject performances in equal measure at Molineux this season - starting this contest with as many home defeats as victories.\nHowever, with Rui Patricio, Jimenez, Diogo Jota, Jonny Castro Otto and Moutinho restored to Nuno's side after an FA Cup draw at League One Shrewsbury, this was an occasion where they were at their best.\nLike in previous impressive displays, much of their threat was delivered via wide positions as wing-backs Matt Doherty and Otto both featured prominently.\nFirst, Spain international Otto stole in at the back post to direct Jimenez's exemplary cross just wide of the bottom right corner.\nAnd on the other side, Doherty made more sprints than any home player in the first period and was unfortunate his surging run was not rewarded with a penalty when Arthur Masuaku's crude challenge upended him.\nWolves continued in the same vein after the break and while Fabianski superbly saved from Otto, it led to the corner from which Saiss finally broke the Hammers' resistance.\nMoutinho's pinpoint delivery found the Moroccan unmarked and he made no mistake from six yards out.\nAnd that proved to be the precursor to the predatory Jimenez - a threat throughout and responsible for six of Wolves' 20 efforts on goal - capitalising in the closing stages.\nFirst he got across his marker to nick a shot across goal into the right corner and then he delivered the coup de grace after being released by Jota, calmly lifting the ball beyond Fabianski.\nBad night for Hammers compounded by injury to ineffective Arnautovic\nAhead of this fixture, all the focus from a claret and blue perspective was on the return of Marko Arnautovic, who was starting his first West Ham game since 12 January.\nHowever, it proved a disappointing and painful evening for the Austrian who was a peripheral figure throughout.\nThe 29-year-old, who has committed to the Hammers after turning down a move to a Chinese club, managed just 30 touches before his evening was cut short by an innocuous challenge 15 minutes from time which resulted in him leaving Molineux on crutches.\nArnautovic's departure had little influence on the game though, which by then seemed like a contest being played out between Fabianski and the Wolves players.\nThe Poland goalkeeper displayed his bravery when clattered by Doherty, and his agility to stop efforts from Jota, Saiss and Otto as the hosts threatened to run riot.\nMan of the match - Raul Jimenez (Wolves)\n'I don't understand what happened' - what they said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I was very pleased in the way we did it. It was a deserved victory, but with tempo and balance and I'm very pleased with the boys who were brilliant today.\n\"We were very compact and didn't concede almost any chances to West Ham so that was a good one.\n\"Sometimes you play well and don't achieve. [Matt] Doherty and Jonny did well and had chances. It requires a lot of effort and a lot of heart to keep going up and down.\"\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini speaking to BBC Sport: \"Maybe we are paying the cost of having so many injured players that we cannot alter our starting XI.\n\"In the first half it was very tight, but after that I don't understand what happened. It is difficult to find a reason for why we played so badly.\n\"These things can happen, there can be a lot of reasons but when you lose I don't like to find excuses - we must become a competitive team as we were three weeks ago.\"\nInfluential Jota - the stats\nWolves have completed a league double over West Ham for the very first time in their history - in the 30th different campaign in which the sides have faced.\nRaul Jimenez has been involved in 13 Premier League goals for Wolves this season (eight goals, five assists). The only player to have had more goal involvements in a PL season for Wolves is Steven Fletcher in 2011-12 (14)\nWest Ham have now lost their last three Premier League away games without scoring a single goal - their longest losing run without scoring a goal since December 2006 (a run of seven).\nWolves' Diogo Jota has had a hand in seven goals in his last six Premier League appearances (5 goals, 2 assists), including a hat-trick against Leicester last time out. He hadn't scored or assisted a single goal in any of his first 13 appearances this season.\nJoao Moutinho has assisted two goals in back-to-back Premier League games. He only managed two assists in his first 22 games this season.\nWolves attempted nine shots on target in this game against West Ham, the most they have attempted in a single Premier League match this season.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Everton on Saturday, 2 February (15:00 GMT) in the Premier League while West Ham host leaders Liverpool on Monday, 4 February (20:00 GMT)"

If Arsenal had our chances they would've beaten us by four. We had some great chances and with the effort we put in we should've got at least a point.\"\nArgentine forward Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson were on board a light aircraft that disappeared from radar over the Channel Islands while travelling from Nantes following Sala's club-record \u00a315m move to Cardiff.\nTributes were paid to Sala before the game from both sets of players, club officials and supporters.\nNeither side had a shot on target in the first half, but Arsenal went ahead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 66th-minute spot kick after Bruno Ecuele Manga clumsily brought down Sead Kolasinac.\nAlexandre Lacazette doubled Arsenal's lead with a fine low strike into the bottom corner, although substitute Nathaniel Mendez-Laing pulled one back for Cardiff in added time when he curled a shot past Bernd Leno.\nHowever, it was not enough for Cardiff and the Gunners' win takes them to 47 points, the same as fourth-placed Chelsea.\nCardiff players 'afraid to fly' after Sala's disappearance - Bamba\nPremier League clubs pay tribute to missing Cardiff striker\nCardiff to honour Sala\nMissing striker's family plan underwater search\nWarnock flown by Sala pilot\n'The most difficult week'\nBefore the game, Warnock said it had been \"by far the most difficult week\" in his 40-year managerial career and admitted he had contemplated quitting following the disappearance of Sala.\nHe said: \"There are more important things, aren't there? It takes something like that to make you realise.\n\"It's probably hit me harder than anyone else as I've met the lad and talked to him for the last six to eight weeks.\"\nAt the Emirates, both captains brought out a bunch of golden daffodils and placed them near the centre spot before the game started, with Cardiff's fans also holding up yellow signs to make a mosaic - matching the colours of Sala's previous club Nantes.\nFans in the away end also held up a banner that said \"We never saw you play and never saw you score but Emiliano our beautiful Bluebird we will love you forever more\" with an on-field tribute involving all the players.\nWarnock's side had the better of the opening 45 minutes, with Bobby Reid shooting just wide then heading over from 10 yards out.\nThe away side also thought they should have had a penalty when a combination of Nacho Monreal and Kolasinac bundled into Oumar Niasse, but referee Mike Dean waved away the protests.\nCallum Paterson had a chance after the break but shot well wide before his side conceded the first of Arsenal's two goals.\nMendez-Laing finished impressively in the 93rd minute but there was to be no equaliser.\nAfter the game, Warnock also praised left-back Joe Bennett, who suffered a family bereavement earlier this week.\n\"Joe was superb,\" added Warnock. \"He lost his father three days ago but to then play like that, I'm really pleased with him.\"\nCaptain Ozil fails to impress, but Arsenal do enough\nThere was a surprise in the Arsenal line-up as Mesut Ozil made his first Premier League appearance of 2019 and was handed the captaincy by Unai Emery.\nEarlier this month, Emery said he was not thinking about the 30-year-old World Cup winner leaving the club, but wanted more consistency from the German midfielder, who is also the Gunners' highest-paid player.\nBut Ozil struggled to make an impact and was replaced after 76 minutes as Aaron Ramsey came on to face his former club.\nNevertheless, the Gunners picked up three points with a much-improved performance in the second half after they had been frustrated by a well-organised Cardiff side in the opening period.\nTheir struggles were illustrated by the fact Aubameyang did not touch the ball in the Cardiff penalty area in the first 45 minutes.\nThe Gabon striker did however later score his 15th Premier League goal of the season midway through the second after Manga's foul on Kolasinac.\nLacazette, who had a shout for a penalty turned down in the first half after going to ground under Manga's challenge, scored Arsenal's second in the 83rd minute, shooting past away goalkeeper Neil Etheridge after a forceful run in from the right touchline.\nArsenal target Perisic hands in transfer request\nArsenal close to signing Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez\nMan of the match - Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal)\nA dozen home league games without defeat - the stats\nArsenal are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League home games since losing their first game of the season against Manchester City in August (won 10, drew two).\nCardiff City remain the only side in English league football yet to lead at half-time in a game in any competition this season (26 games).\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock's four top-flight visits to Arsenal have all ended in defeat, all with different teams in different decades - October 1991 with Notts County (0-2), September 2006 with Sheffield United (0-3), December 2011 with QPR (0-1) and January 2019 with the Bluebirds (0-2).\nArsenal's Stephan Lichtsteiner made his 400th appearance in the big five European leagues and became the first outfield player aged 35+ to start a Premier League game for Arsenal (35 years, 13 days) since Sol Campbell v Fulham in May 2010.\nArsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette have each scored five Premier League goals against promoted sides this season, more than any other player.\nAubameyang hit his 25th goal in his 37th Premier League appearance for Arsenal, the quickest of any player to reach that total for the Gunners in the competition.\n'We struggled a lot' - what they said\nArsenal manager Unai Emery told Match of the Day: \"We are happy. In the first half we didn't deserve to go in winning and in the second half we played better, controlled the match better and created more chances.\n\"We started well in the first 10 minutes then I was not surprised with the performance as Cardiff worked very well.\n\"We struggled a lot in the match but it's very important to get the three points. We know each match is difficult and we are happy - the difference is small details.\"\nCardiff City manager Neil Warnock to Match of the Day: \"They should've had a penalty in the first half and I spoke to Bruno (Ecuele Manga) at half time so for him to dive in like that again (on Kolasinac), I'm just really disappointed. The players have to think about their responsibilities, it was just amateur.\"\nOn whether his side will buy any players in the rest of the transfer window: \"I worked on Emiliano for a couple of months and I can't see us bringing in anyone up front - we won't get anyone like Emiliano, but we could bring in one or two defenders.\"\nWhat's next?\nCardiff, 18th in the Premier League, entertain Bournemouth on Saturday (17:30 GMT), while Arsenal play at Manchester City the following day (16:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-2 Burnley: Hosts rescue late point\nManchester United caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said the side's fans were treated to a \"typical Old Trafford finish\" as they came from 2-0 down to rescue a dramatic point against Burnley.\nUnited were facing their first defeat under Solskjaer until Paul Pogba scored from the penalty spot in the 87th minute and Victor Lindelof scrambled in a 92nd-minute equaliser.\nThe hosts had previously won all eight matches since the Norwegian took charge.\nBurnley had defended resolutely until conceding twice late on and were in front thanks to second-half goals from Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood.\nBarnes smashed home from inside the penalty area at the start of the second half after a mistake by Andreas Pereira and Wood headed in Barnes' cross in the 81st minute.\n\"The comeback was brilliant, the players have been asked about how they would react if they went 1-0 or 2-0 down so I felt the comeback was fantastic,\" Solskjaer said.\n\"We had loads of chances, loads of possession, we didn't deserve to lose.\n\"We disappointed ourselves and we disappointed the crowd today, but the ones who stayed had a typical Old Trafford finish to the game so that was a big plus.\"\nThe draw means United fail to move level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea, while Burnley go up a place to 15th, four points clear of the relegation zone.\nReaction to Tuesday's Premier League games\nOld Trafford witnesses more late drama\nFormer striker Solskjaer's most famous moment as a player at Manchester United was the winning goal in a stunning comeback in the 1999 Champions League final.\nThis turnaround is less significant, and only salvaged a draw rather than a win, but it will help to maintain the momentum gained at Old Trafford under Solskjaer's management.\nAfter Marcus Rashford put an excellent chance wide in the ninth minute, United had struggled to break down Burnley. They showed plenty of intent but were limited largely to shots from outside the penalty area.\nWood's header looked to have settled the game but six minutes later Jeff Hendrick pulled Jesse Lingard down in the penalty area and when Pogba converted calmly into the top corner, a frantic finished ensued.\nPogba had an effort from 18 yards brilliantly saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton before United snatched their equaliser in the second of five minutes of added time.\nPreviously Burnley's defence had cleared any crosses but Alexis Sanchez managed to get a header on goal. Although his effort was saved by Heaton, the Burnley goalkeeper could do nothing to prevent Lindelof following up from close range.\nBurnley denied rare win\nHad the game ended after Wood's goal, it would be hard to argue Burnley did not deserve to win.\nUnited had applied pressure but Burnley's back four and goalkeeper Heaton had been excellent and prevented the hosts creating clear-cut opportunities.\nOn Saturday Sean Dyche's side were thrashed 5-0 at Manchester City in the FA Cup but with the first-choice line-up restored, after Dyche made seven changes at Etihad Stadium, Burnley's resilience returned.\nThe Clarets also posed a threat going forward and were clinical when their own two opportunities came.\nThere was clear disappointment at full-time among the Burnley team, as they were denied a first win at Old Trafford since 1962, but manager Sean Dyche maintained after the game that it was not a case of two points dropped.\nThe draw extends their unbeaten league run to five games.\n\"It was an excellent performance; we know they are in fine form,\" Dyche said.\n\"We were resilient, we are getting harder and harder to beat, and we can score goals as well.\n\"Our performances lately have picked up, their will, desire and mentality is growing all the time.\n\"I don't know where the five minutes of stoppage-time came from. That's a bugbear because it gave the crowd a lift. I also think Lindelof is offside when Alexis Sanchez heads it, but like I say the margins are tight.\"\nSolskjaer makes first mistakes in charge\nSolskjaer's spell in charge at Old Trafford had been immaculate with eight wins from eight since replacing Jose Mourinho, and calls had been increasing for him to be given the job permanently.\nDespite the dramatic fightback, there were a number of negatives from the performance against Burnley.\nSolskjaer made five changes from Friday's FA Cup win against Arsenal with Andreas Pereira, Romelu Lukaku and Juan Mata among those to come in.\nPereira was poor on his first league start since August and was at fault for Burnley's opener when he was easily dispossessed by Jack Cork 25 yards from his own goal.\nLukaku struggled to make an impact up front on his first league start under Solskjaer with Rashford, who had scored five goals in eight games under the Norwegian, was switched to a wide left position where he was less effective.\nMata played alongside Lukaku and Rashford in a front three and looked off the pace. United's attack looked more potent when Lingard and Sanchez were introduced as substitutes.\n\"We fought, that wasn't the problem. We were just too slow in possession in the first half,\" Solskjaer said.\n\"For the first goal we played our way into trouble. It wasn't the attitude, the application was too slow and the tempo on the ball wasn't good enough. But the reaction was good.\"\nMan of the match - Tom Heaton (Burnley)\nBurnley's wait goes on - the best stats\nManchester United came from two goals down to draw against Burnley for the second time in as many Premier League meetings at Old Trafford, also doing so against the Clarets in December 2017.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes has scored in his past two Premier League appearances at Old Trafford against Manchester United (two goals).\nPaul Pogba has both scored and missed a Premier League penalty against Burnley this season, failing from the spot at Turf Moor in September.\nVictor Lindelof became the fourth Swedish player to score in the Premier League for Manchester United, after Jesper Blomqvist, Henrik Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\nSean Dyche has never lost a Premier League game on a Tuesday as Burnley manager, winning three and drawing three of six matches.\nBurnley's Chris Wood has scored three goals in his past five Premier League games - as many as in his previous 25 appearances combined.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to Leicester on Sunday (14:05 GMT). Burnley host Southampton a day earlier at 15:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 2-1 Manchester City\nManchester City's title hopes suffered a huge blow as Newcastle came from a goal down to record a remarkable victory over the defending champions at St James' Park.\nTwo defensive lapses cost Pep Guardiola's side the chance to cut Liverpool's lead at the top of the Premier League to one point. The Reds face Leicester at home on Wednesday.\nCity could not have got off to a better start when Sergio Aguero hooked home after only 24 seconds.\nThe Argentine also had a goal disallowed soon after when referee Paul Tierney adjudged Kevin De Bruyne had delivered a free-kick before he gave him the signal. The Belgian was booked as a consequence.\nGuardiola's side rarely troubled Magpies keeper Martin Dubravka thereafter, and Rafael Benitez's men grew in belief.\nThe home support erupted in the 66th minute when Salomon Rondon instinctively fired in after connecting with Isaac Hayden's header from 12 yards out.\nAnd the match turned on its head in the 78th minute when the Magpies were awarded a penalty after Fernandinho - overplaying at the back - fouled Sean Longstaff in the area after being robbed of possession.\nMatt Ritchie waited more than two minutes as City keeper Ederson received treatment, before firing his spot-kick beyond the reach of the Brazilian.\nGuardiola wary of Man City's difficult run of league fixtures\n'Give him a medal!' - Liverpool fans thank Benitez\nDid City relinquish the title at St James'?\nMany will be looking at this scoreline in disbelief.\nCity had not lost to Newcastle in 22 league games, with the North East club having only collected three points from a possible 66 against their opponents.\nGuardiola's side came to St James' Park on the back on a 5-0 thrashing of Burnley in the FA Cup, and having put three goals past Huddersfield and Wolves in their previous two league encounters.\nNothing less than three points seemed likely and when Aguero fired City into the lead inside a minute, following a cross from Raheem Sterling, that became an apparent certainty.\nBut then City eased off the pedal.\nThey continued to dominate possession but Newcastle sat deep and only allowed City's widemen to get in behind them on a handful of occasions.\nSterling should have made the most of those rare crosses that got through into the six-yard area, but he failed to attack Leroy Sane's delivery - much to the frustration of his manager.\nAnd Magpies keeper Dubravka only made one save of note - a block to keep out David Silva's effort in the 58th minute, which was City's final effort on target.\nThis defeat could be the moment City look back on as pivotal in the title race.\nAre dark clouds starting to shift over Tyneside?\nTwo efforts on goal and two on target: Newcastle's forays forward might have been few but, unlike City, they made the most of them.\nWhen Newcastle wanted relief from City's persistent attacks they sought Rondon whose hold-up play was impeccable once again.\nThe Venezuelan also remains the Magpies' biggest weapon in the opposition area and, with his first attempt on goal, he hooked a shot past the reach of Ederson.\nBenitez no doubt would have been happy with a point, but his side were then given a golden opportunity to take all three.\nThe usually focused Fernandinho lost his bearings 12 minutes from time when his attempt to play a backpass to his keeper was pounced upon by Longstaff.\nThe midfielder had his legs clipped by the Brazilian midfielder and Tierney signalled a spot-kick.\nEderson needed treatment on the pitch which kept the home crowd and penalty-taker Ritchie waiting, but the Scot kept his nerves in control and fired low to the left of the City keeper once play resumed.\nWith new signing Miguel Almiron on his way and another potentially arriving, it seems that some of dark clouds hanging over Tyneside are starting to shift.\nMan of the match - Fabian Schar (Newcastle)\nCity drop as many points as 2017-18 campaign - the stats\nNewcastle have beaten Manchester City in a Premier League game for the first time since September 2005, ending a run of 22 meetings without a win against them in the division (D3, L19).\nThis was Guardiola's 100th Premier League game in charge of Manchester City (W73, D15, L12 - 234 points); despite the defeat, only Jose Mourinho (W73, D18, L9 - 237 points) picked up more points in his first 100 managerial games in the competition than the Spaniard.\nNewcastle have now won five of their last seven home Premier League matches against sides starting the day in the top two in the table (L2).\nCity have now dropped 16 points in their 24 Premier League games this season having drawn twice and lost four times; already more than they dropped in the entirety of 2017-18 (14 - four draws, two defeats).\nCity have lost three games in which they have been ahead in the Premier League this season, their most in a single campaign since 2008-09 (four).\nCity forward Sergio Aguero has now scored 15 Premier League goals against Newcastle; only Alan Shearer v Leeds (20 goals), Shearer v Everton (16) and Les Ferdinand v Everton (16) have more against a single club in the competition's history.\nAguero's goal after 24 seconds was the earliest goal scored in this season's Premier League, and the fastest Manchester City have scored in a Premier League game since Jesus Navas netted after 13 seconds against Tottenham in November 2013.\nOf Matt Ritchie's 16 league goals for Newcastle, 14 have been at St. James' Park; his penalty was Newcastle's first to be scored in the Premier League since Georginio Wijnaldum scored from the spot against Spurs in May 2016.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are at Tottenham on Saturday (12:30 GMT) and City host Arsenal on Sunday (16:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 4-0 Chelsea: Cherries cruise past Champions League-chasing Chelsea\nChelsea slipped out of the top four in the Premier League as two goals and an assist by Joshua King helped Bournemouth to a thumping victory over the Champions League hopefuls.\nKing scored either side of a composed David Brooks finish, before Charlie Daniels added a fourth as the Cherries condemned the visitors to a second consecutive league defeat.\nBournemouth were fortunate to be level at the interval as Artur Boruc produced five impressive saves to deny a Chelsea side that failed to penetrate their hosts' defence despite 70% of possession.\nBut the hosts took just two minutes of the second half to go in front as King arrived late in the Chelsea box to smash Brooks' cutback past goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nThe duo combined again for the second as King lofted the ball over a scrambling Chelsea defence for Brooks to latch on to and fire into the bottom corner.\nThe influential Welshman hobbled off in the second half, but King added a third with the final touch of a flowing Bournemouth move - a right-footed finish from close range.\nSubstitute Daniels produced the finishing touch within a minute of being on the pitch with a stooping header in injury time.\nA second consecutive league win for Bournemouth moved them up to 10th in the table, while Chelsea drop to fifth by virtue of scoring fewer goals than Arsenal.\n'It's my fault' - Sarri takes blame for Chelsea defeat\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League matches\nNo Wilson, no problems\nBournemouth scored four goals for the third time this season despite the absence of top goalscorer Callum Wilson, who had minor knee surgery.\nThe England striker has scored 11 goals for the Cherries this season, but King and Brooks showed they still carry a threat without him.\nThe hosts did not have many chances but were clinical in front of goal - scoring four goals from just six shots in a blistering second half.\nBut they were also impressive at the opposite end of the pitch as well.\nThe talented Brooks has had an impressive first season in the top flight, and his defensive display in man-marking Jorginho prevented Chelsea finding openings despite large spells of possession.\nFollowing the game, Howe said it was something his side had worked on.\n\"David did a brilliant job beyond his years with his diligence, and then he showed his class at the other end as well so I'm pleased for him,\" said Howe.\nChelsea pass themselves into trouble\nThe visitors' Champions League ambitions took a major blow on the south coast, as they crumbled to their heaviest league defeat since 1996.\nMaurizio Sarri's men should have been comfortably in front after a dominant first half, but on the few occasions they managed to get in behind their hosts, they met an inspired Boruc.\nThe 38-year-old pulled off a fingertip save to stop Mateo Kovacic giving Chelsea the lead with a close-range header in the sixth minute.\nAnd the Blues made 405 passes in the first half but managed only five shots at goal as they failed to carve open a stubborn Bournemouth defence.\nChelsea loan signing Gonzalo Higuain played just over an hour on his Premier League debut, but his first instinct was to try to link up with talisman Eden Hazard rather than test Boruc.\nThe Argentina international failed to register a single shot on goal during his 65 minutes on the field, but he and Hazard played 15 passes to each other.\nImprovements will have to be made in the coming weeks if Chelsea are to trouble Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, before attempting to regain their place in the top four.\nMan of the match - David Brooks (Bournemouth)\n'We are very pleased with how our season is shaping up' - what they said\nSpeaking to Match of the Day, Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe said: \"That has got to be up there [as one of my best results]. It was a big night for us and it is great to do it here in front of our own fans.\n\"We have always been known for our attacking play but our defensive play needed looking at. We had long periods without the ball so full credit to all of our players. Artur Boruc was superb and his save very early in the match was world-class.\n\"It is a good place to be but we have high standards and high expectations. The wins are the most important things and we are very pleased with how our season is shaping up.\"\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri told Match of the Day: \"We need to change something in the mentality because you can concede, but you need to play because the match was under control in the first half.\n\"It is a very strong setback because we knew this match was very important. It is not easy to play after today but we need to react.\"\nCherries always beat Chelsea on Wednesday's - match stats\nBournemouth secured only their second-ever competitive home win against Chelsea and first since September 1988 (L5).\nThis is just the second time in Premier League history Chelsea have lost a game by a four-goal margin, after losing 5-1 to Liverpool in September 1996.\nChelsea have lost consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March 2018, when they were defeated by both Manchester clubs.\nBoth of Bournemouth's Premier League wins on a Wednesday have come against Chelsea.\nChelsea have won 47 points after 24 games this season - three fewer than at this stage in 2017-18 (50).\nBrooks both scored and assisted in an English league game for the first time in his career.\nKing has scored in each of his last two Premier League appearances against Chelsea at the Vitality Stadium.\nKing has been directly involved in 48 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (38 goals, 10 assists), 12 more than any other Cherries player in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Cardiff City in the Premier League on Saturday, 2 February (15:00 GMT), while Chelsea host Huddersfield Town at the same time."

That is something you can't do.\"\nMamadou Sakho missed two glorious opportunities to score Palace's second either side of Ward-Prowse's equaliser, the former Liverpool defender having a header cleared off the line by Jan Bednarek before sending another powerful header over the bar.\nThe two teams remain level in the table, four points above the Premier League's bottom three.\nSouthampton fortunate to escape with a draw\nSaints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said before the game that his side are capable of looking \"beyond\" just Premier League survival after collecting 13 points from their eight league matches since the Austrian replaced Mark Hughes at the start of December.\nOn this evidence, though, Southampton still have plenty of work to do to secure their top-flight status.\nOther than routine saves from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Danny Ings either side of half-time, Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita had little to do until Ward-Prowse's late leveller.\nThe 24-year-old midfielder has played an integral role in Southampton's recent revival under Hasenhuttl, and he delivered for the hosts again to rescue a point with a composed finish from Matt Targett's cross.\nSaints threw caution to the wind in search of a late winner and Stuart Armstrong's curling effort was palmed to safety by Guaita, but 10-man Palace held on to claim a share of the spoils.\nHasenhuttl's side were perhaps lucky to finish the game with 11 men after Jack Stephens' lunging tackle on Andros Townsend in the first half, but the centre-back was not even booked.\nMixed evening for Zaha\nPalace have impressed on the road in recent months, recording eye-catching victories at Wolves and Manchester City while running Liverpool close in a seven-goal thriller at Anfield.\nRemarkably, 18 of their 24 Premier League goals this season have come away from Selhurst Park.\nZaha - who was making his 150th top-flight appearance for the club - had last found the net in a 1-0 victory at Huddersfield in mid-September, but the 26-year-old ended his barren run with a powerful finish past Alex McCarthy from the left-hand corner of the penalty area.\nThe Ivory Coast international undid his good work three minutes from time, however, when he was needlessly sent off.\nZaha was shown his first yellow card after squaring up to the Southampton goalscorer following an innocuous-looking challenge, and he was given his marching orders seconds later after clapping sarcastically in the direction of Marriner.\nThe former Manchester United forward will now miss Saturday's home match against Fulham through suspension.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nSaints held again - the stats\nNo Premier League side have drawn more games this season than Southampton (8).\nPalace have dropped 13 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season - only Fulham and Southampton (15 each) have lost more.\nSouthampton have only lost one of their past 11 top-flight home meetings with Crystal Palace (W8 D2).\nAll four of Zaha's Premier League goals this season have been away from home. It's the highest number of goals scored by a player this season without netting in home games.\nZaha became only the second Palace player to score and be sent off in the same Premier League match, after Glenn Murray against West Ham in February 2015.\nWard-Prowse has scored three goals in 12 Premier League appearances this season, as many as he netted in 30 in the competition last term.\n'A very, very important point' - what the managers said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"We had chances [to win], there's no doubt about that.\n\"Especially in the second half we had balls cleared off the line and several other very good opportunities.\n\"Of course we're going to be a bit disappointed, and to lose a player through a sending-off is even more disappointing.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"I think the second half was much better.\n\"After 10 days without a game it took time for us to get into the rhythm to create chances.\n\"We always want to play forward but sometimes it's not possible, mainly against balanced and well organised teams.\n\"We have to wait until the right moment comes.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to Burnley this Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Palace take on 19th-placed Fulham at Selhurst Park at the same time."

it is not exactly what we wanted to have, but still everything is fine,\" added the former Borussia Dortmund manager.\nNerves set in at Anfield\nDespite Klopp's side moving a point further ahead of Guardiola's City, this result will be widely viewed as two dropped.\nExcept for their initial flurry, Liverpool were nervous, sluggish and a long way from their incisive best on an icy surface - yet they remain in a strong position with 14 games remaining as they chase a first league title since 1990.\nLiverpool had won seven top-flight games in a row at Anfield and expectant home fans chanted the name of their former manager Rafael Benitez - who masterminded Newcastle's win over City - after Senegal winger Mane scored by cutting inside and finding the net with a low, skidding shot.\nBrazil striker Roberto Firmino was then denied by a fine save from Kasper Schmeichel but the Foxes grew into a game that saw two of the leaders' star performers this season have relatively poor nights.\nAlisson, who gifted Leicester a goal at the King Power Stadium on 1 September, made two mistakes in the first half, with the second error leading to a golden chance for James Maddison, who headed wide.\nNetherlands defender Virgil van Dijk, who was ill in the build-up to the game, was also not at his imperious best and Leicester's equaliser came when he failed to pick up England centre-back Maguire at the back post.\nWhile Klopp and Liverpool were frustrated when Martin Atkinson ignored the claims for a penalty for the clip on Keita, a draw was the correct outcome.\nLeicester prove they are behind Puel\nIt has been a poor start to 2019 for Leicester after they followed their FA Cup exit at League Two Newport with defeats at home to Southampton and away at Wolves.\nBut at Anfield they recovered from a disastrous start and were both threatening in attack and organised in defence, with Marc Albrighton causing problems at one end and Ben Chilwell keeping Mohamed Salah - the league's leading scorer - quiet at the other.\nIt has been suggested Claude Puel, in charge of the Foxes since October 2017, is under pressure and Leicester's recent results have not done the Frenchman any favours.\nBut his players produced an energetic performance that suggests they are fully behind their manager.\nIt was a timely effort too, given it starts a run of tough fixtures that include games against Manchester United and Tottenham.\nLeicester, 11th in the table - three points behind seventh-placed Wolves - had lost on six of their last seven visits to Anfield yet might have been celebrating a famous victory had they been more clinical.\nAt 1-0, Maddison headed wide from Albrighton's cross following the error by Alisson and then the same player horribly mis-hit another chance after Chilwell got behind the Liverpool defence when it was 1-1.\nAlisson then made a save with his feet to prevent a Firmino own goal after Liverpool again failed to pick up Maguire from a set piece, while Demarai Gray shot at the keeper instead of passing to team-mates who were in much better positions.\nNevertheless this was another positive result against a side in the top six, following their victories over Chelsea and Manchester City in December.\nPuel will now hope to coax more consistency from his players against teams around them in the table.\nMan of the match - Ben Chilwell (Leicester City)\n'We showed fantastic character' - what they said\nLeicester City manager Claude Puel:\n\"I have a little regret at the end because we had some fantastic chances at the beginning of the second half.\n\"We started slowly and conceded a goal but after we showed fantastic character and personality.\n\"We put them under pressure at the beginning of the second half and in this period we have to be more clinical.\"\nDefensive questions for Liverpool? - the stats\nLiverpool have conceded in their past three Premier League home games, after only conceding in two of their opening nine home league games this season.\nLeicester are the first team outside the top six that Liverpool have failed to beat in the Premier League this season.\nLiverpool attempted just 10 shots in this game - the only occasions when they have had fewer in the Premier League this season were both against Manchester City.\nLeicester have avoided defeat in each of their past two Premier League away games at 'top six' sides (1-0 v Chelsea and 1-1 v Liverpool).\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane has now scored 10-plus Premier League goals in his five seasons in the England's top flight.\nHarry Maguire's three league goals for Leicester this season have all come away from home.\nWhat's next\nLiverpool's lead could be down to two points by the time they are next in action, away at West Ham on Monday (20:00 GMT). Leicester are back at the King Power on Sunday when Manchester United are the visitors (14:05 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 2-1 Watford: Mauricio Pochettino pleased to end 'difficult week' with win\nManager Mauricio Pochettino said it was \"so important to smile\" again after Tottenham bounced back from two cup exits with victory over Watford at Wembley.\nAfter Craig Cathcart's 38th-minute opener, Spurs scored twice in the final 10 minutes - Son Heung-min, back from the Asian Cup, equalising before Fernando Llorente nodded in an 87th-minute winner.\n\"I think we fully deserved the victory,\" said Pochettino, whose side lost their Carabao Cup semi-final to Chelsea and were then dumped out of the FA Cup by Crystal Palace.\n\"It arrived late, but we kept pushing. It was a fantastic second-half performance. The first half, it was difficult to create chances - we dominated, but didn't create.\n\"It's fantastic to win again. After a difficult week it's so important to smile. The mentality is perfect.\"\nHis mood was very different when Cathcart headed home Jose Holebas' out-swinging corner seven minutes before the break.\nTottenham increased the pressure in the second half. Llorente, deputising for injured leading striker Harry Kane, twice had great opportunities to score but missed from close range before Son Heung-min lifted the home support when he thrashed home from 12 yards out.\nBut with full-time fast approaching, Llorente finally hit the target when he guided Danny Rose's hanging ball past Ben Foster.\nSpurs remain in third but are now only two points behind defending champions Manchester City and seven behind leaders Liverpool.\nWatford stay in ninth.\nLlorente's day ends on a high\nLlorente was set to hog the headlines for the wrong reasons before his late winner.\nThe 33-year-old has largely been ineffective as a 'Plan B' for Spurs' attack since his \u00a312m move from Swansea in 2017, and after missing two glorious opportunities against Watford it seemed that this would be another day to forget.\nThe first of those saw him knee a shot over the bar after his initial strike was superbly blocked by Foster, and the second was a header from four yards that he directed into the side-netting.\nBut Pochettino chose to persevere with him, and three minutes before the end of normal time Llorente hit the sweet spot with an angled header that found the far corner.\nSon shines, but another Lloris lapse\nLlorente's fellow forward Son, in contrast, is becoming one of the team's more consistent performers. The South Korean produced yet another energetic performance, which was all the more impressive because he only returned from the United Arab Emirates on Saturday.\nHe made the most sprints of any of his team-mates - 17 - with the most crucial coming in the 80th minute when he latched on to the loose ball after Llorente lost control and thumped home a ferocious shot. It was his 13th goal of the season.\nHe had earlier gone close with a superb turn and shot from 20 yards in the first half, which whistled past Foster's right-hand post.\nLloris might not be as jubilant as Llorente and Son following another mistake which resulted in Cathcart's opener.\nHis error in July's World Cup final was the most high profile, but he has experienced lapses in judgement since - against Barcelona and then PSV Eindhoven. This latest mistake might have some Spurs fans questioning whether he is the right number one for their team.\nLloris was all at sea when he failed to fully commit himself to meeting Holebas' corner, which gave Cathcart the simple task of nodding into an unguarded net.\nHornets fail to hang on\nWatford were a little more than 10 minutes away from their first league double over Tottenham.\nAside from Cathcart's effort, they rarely threatened Lloris' goalmouth in a match where their defensive qualities were tested.\nBoth full-backs Daryl Janmaat and Holebas impressed both at the back and in attack, while centre-half Ben Wilmot produced the block of the match when he deflected Rose's shot off the line having only been on the pitch for a minute.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\nSpurs the 'no-draw specialists' - the stats\nTottenham (54 points) have at least four more points after 24 Premier League games than they have ever had at this stage of the competition.\nOnly against Arsenal (nine) and Manchester United (10) have Watford lost more Premier League games than they have against Spurs (eight).\nWatford have now lost four straight matches at Wembley, only Brentford (five), Shrewsbury Town (five) and Newcastle United (seven) are on longer current losing runs.\nTottenham have now matched Bolton's Premier League record of the most consecutive matches without a draw in the competition (28 - W21 L7).\nSpurs have netted 13 headed goals in the Premier League in 2018-19, their most in a single top-flight season since 1999-00, when they scored 16 under manager George Graham.\nWatford's Cathcart is the first defender to score both home and away against Tottenham within the same Premier League season since Per Mertesacker did so for Arsenal in 2012-13.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Newcastle on Saturday (12:30 GMT) and Watford travel to Brighton on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

He gives you everything and when he is exhausted he says he needs to rest. On the pitch he is always 100 per cent in every action.\"\n\"He works so hard, he pushes and never gives up - he tries, tries, tries, tries.\"\nNewcastle were well organised and gritty throughout, with Fabian Schar's acrobatic goalline clearance to deny Christian Eriksen in the second half epitomising their spirit.\nRafael Benitez's side had chances of their own, with Salomon Rondon heading against the post with the score at 0-0 but their resistance was broken when substitute Fernando Llorente laid the ball off for Son to score a ninth goal in his past 10 Spurs appearances.\nThe win means Pochettino's side set a Premier League record as they reached 29 matches in a row without a draw, eclipsing Bolton's mark of 28 set in 2011.\nRelive Tottenham's late win\nSon and persistence win the day\nSpurs' lack of draws perhaps shows they refuse to settle and that has certainly been the case in recent weeks with late goals earning wins against Fulham, Watford and now Newcastle.\nThe snatching of such wins points to the kind of spirit Pochettino has needed from his players when faced with injuries to key names like Harry Kane and Dele Alli.\nPerhaps no-one has stepped up more than Son.\nHis return from South Korea duty at the Asian Cup has proven key and just as fatigue looked to be setting in at Wembley, he found the space to win it.\nIt was the 14th goal he has been directly involved in during his past 10 Tottenham outings and ultimately moved his side above Manchester City - who play Arsenal on Sunday - and four points behind leaders Liverpool.\nNo-one had more shots than Son's five but Llorente's introduction from the bench on the hour was also pivotal as he served up the assist.\nSpurs, with help from Dubravka, ultimately found an answer against a side who sat deep in a 5-4-1 formation and threatened in pockets on the break.\nGiven Lucas Moura headed wide from close range early on, Erik Lamela headed against the bar and Schar's clearance from Eriksen, few could argue Spurs did not deserve three points.\nPochettino may not be happy that only four of their 21 shots hit the target but they got the job done for a third league win in a row.\nMatch of the Day analysis\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas said: \"Son Heung-min is Tottenham's danger man, and especially in the first half, Newcastle knew he was playing out wide and they surrounded him with bodies.\n\"It was more of the same in the second half so Mauricio Pochettino made a couple of changes and he went with three at the back which allowed them width and meant Son could play in the pocket of space behind substitute Fernando Llorente. It allowed Spurs to play more direct.\n\"It was a lovely touch for the goal and Martin Dubravka made a big mistake. Spurs are still in the title race and it's in their hands to put themselves amongst it.\"\nNewcastle show promise in defeat\nNewcastle, while defensive, looked confident in their tactics following Wednesday's shock win over Manchester City.\nTheir wing-backs - DeAndre Yedlin and Matt Ritchie - tucked in to make a narrow back five and Spurs were repeatedly forced left.\nJan Vertonghen had delivered nine crosses by half-time, his highest mark in the Premier League, as Newcastle's plans largely worked.\nAnd with Rondon a presence up top they had chances of their own. He saw an effort blocked in the box before the break and perhaps should have opened the scoring after the interval when his guided header hit the post with Hugo Lloris beaten.\nAyoze Perez also warmed the hands of the Spurs keeper from long range in the second period as Newcastle showed pockets of threat for their 28% possession.\nThey could have been better on the ball for periods, but Benitez will look at the dogged displays of Schar and Jamaal Lascelles as positives, along with the general resistance his side offered.\nJanuary addition Antonio Barreca came off the bench for his debut late on, while record signing Miguel Almiron was ineligible while he awaits a visa.\nIf the new \u00a320m forward brings the quality fans crave, gutsy displays like this will at least give him a solid platform from which to perform as they look to climb the table after a result which leaves them 15th.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min\nFernando turns provider - key stats\nNewcastle have lost their past eight visits to Wembley in all competitions since winning the 1955 FA Cup final against Manchester City - extending their record for worst ever losing run by a team at the stadium.\nTottenham have lost just one of their past 27 home Premier League games in February (W19 D7).\nNewcastle have lost 13 of their past 14 Premier League games away to 'big six' teams (D1), since beating Tottenham 2-1 in December 2015.\nFernando Llorente has been involved in seven goals in his past eight appearances for Tottenham in all competitions (five goals, two assists).\nLlorente provided assists in back to back league games for the first time since March 2008 for Athletic Bilbao.\nThe Llorente impact - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was difficult to find space. We created some chances in the first and second half but the most important thing in the end is to keep pushing and it was a massive effort again in the second game consecutively. Once again I need to praise my players.\n\"Llorente, after Harry Kane's injury, plays four games in a row and with three days' recovery the normal thing is to rotate. It upsets me a little bit because the debate in England is difficult to understand. You have 24 players you need to use.\"\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez: \"I think we did well in the first half and we had chances in the beginning of the second half. They were pushing hard, we were defending well and this goal we could've avoided.\n\"We have to give credit to Son because the shot was a good one and we hit the post in the second half, that was a big chance for us. You have to give credit to Tottenham because they have injuries. It was not easy for us.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham welcome Leicester to Wembley on Sunday, 10 February (13:30 GMT), while Newcastle travel to Wolves a day later (20:00 GMT)."

Ashley Barnes had no other choice as the keeper takes the legs away and yet Ashley comes away with a booking.\n\"I can't be any more clear in my idea. That first one was just a plain, simple penalty.\"\nNathan Redmond had given Southampton the lead earlier in the second half when he picked up Jan Bednarek's pass and fired a low shot into the bottom corner from around 20 yards.\nSaints striker Danny Ings had the best opportunity of the opening 45 minutes, firing straight at Tom Heaton in a one-on-one situation before being forced off with an injury.\nBarnes twice went close in the final 15 minutes of normal time - forcing a point-blank save out of Heaton before thumping against the crossbar from Johann Berg Gudmundsson's flick-on - but he made no mistake from the spot.\nThe two teams are locked on 24 points but sit just two points above the relegation zone following Cardiff's win over Bournemouth in Saturday's late game.\nAll's well that ends well for Burnley\nDespite collecting 11 points from their previous five league games - fewer only than Manchester United and Manchester City - Burnley went into Saturday's clash just one place above the bottom three.\nIt looked as though the Clarets were going to slip to their first defeat of the new year after Redmond's magnificent strike, but Barnes' late penalty stretched their unbeaten run to six league matches.\nThe home supporters were incensed at the decision not to award Dyche's side a penalty in the first half when McCarthy brought down Barnes, who reacted furiously at being shown a yellow card by Taylor.\nBurnley had gone 67 games without a penalty in the Premier League prior to Saturday, but that long wait came to an end when Stephens inexplicably handled the ball inside the area - under pressure from Clarets debutant Crouch.\nThe 38-year-old came on in the 75th minute and caused havoc in the Southampton rearguard, having a goal-bound shot blocked by Gudmundsson before forcing Stephens into conceding the decisive spot-kick.\nIt could prove to be an important point for the Dyche's team, who face trips to Brighton and Newcastle either side of a home clash with Tottenham later this month.\nSaints rue missed chances\nSouthampton were perhaps fortunate to draw against fellow strugglers Crystal Palace on Wednesday, but they should have picked up a win here after defending doggedly for the majority of the second half.\nThey came under intense pressure towards the end of the game as Barnes missed two golden opportunities to equalise before firing past McCarthy from 12 yards, but the visitors had created the better chances up to that point.\nIngs should have given Ralph Hasenhuttl's side the lead in the first half after running on to Matt Targett's long pass, but the Liverpool loanee fired straight at Heaton.\nPhil Bardsley cleared off the line within minutes of the restart after Chris Wood inadvertently flicked another Targett delivery towards his own net, before Heaton produced a fine one-handed save from James Ward-Prowse's header.\nVictory would have lifted the Saints level on points with 14th-placed Crystal Palace, but they remain perilously close to the drop zone despite extending their unbeaten run under Hasenhuttl to five matches.\nThey will be desperate to return to winning ways at home to 18th-placed Cardiff next weekend.\nMan of the match - Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\nRedmond continues fine form - the stats\nBurnley are winless in their past 14 Premier League games played in February (D7 L7).\nSouthampton have won eight points in their past four Premier League away games (W2 D2), as many as they managed in their previous 11.\nSouthampton are unbeaten in five Premier League games (W2 D3), their longest run without defeat in the competition since October 2016 (also five games).\nAll five of Redmond's Premier League goal involvements for Southampton this season have come under Hasenhuttl, with five goals and two assists in 10 appearances (after none in 15 games before that this term).\nCrouch became the second oldest player to play for Burnley in the Premier League (38 years, three days) after Graham Alexander in May 2010 (38 years, 211 days).\nBurnley's Crouch has played for seven different clubs in the Premier League, with only Marcus Bent appearing for more (eight, with Craig Bellamy, Andrew Cole, Wayne Routledge and Tal Ben Haim also managing seven).\nBarnes has scored 15 goals for Burnley in the league since the start of last season, more than any other player at the club.\nFirst-half decision 'baffles' Dyche - what the managers said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We were relentless in our attitude again and that is coming back into our play at speed. The least we deserved was a point.\n\"What a calm penalty Barnes took at the end of the game. He stayed calm and that's a good quality.\"\nOn Crouch's debut off the bench: \"Crouch can play, he knows the game and can adapt. And he causes confusion. The ball goes into the box and people are wondering who is doing what.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl:\n\"The 1-1 with Crystal Palace on Wednesday felt a success but this feels like losing. But I think it was a fair result. We had a few situations where we were lucky.\n\"We are unbeaten in five games which is important for me. We had a big chance but it's important to keep winning points consistently and that's what we are doing. It's important steps.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Cardiff at St Mary's on Saturday, 9 February (15:00 GMT), while Burnley travel to Brighton in the day's late game (17:30 GMT)."

We must keep fighting to improve.\"\nThe game was stopped for around three minutes in the second half because of a black cat on the pitch.\nWhat now for Everton?\nThere were seven additional minutes at the finish, partly due to the time it took to for the cat to come off the pitch, and thousands of Everton fans had already left Goodison Park by the time referee Lee Mason blew the final whistle.\nThis was Everton's fourth defeat in seven league and cup games in 2019 - and their 10th in the Premier League this season.\nKnocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Millwall last week and unable to string together a positive run of results in the top tier, the season is already threatening to peter out with 13 matches left.\nEverton were edgy and anxious, a team lacking in confidence, against Wolves.\nSilva's side got off to an awful start when Leighton Baines conceded an early penalty after fouling Matt Doherty before the Toffees captain went off injured before half-time.\nAlthough Gomes equalised with a lovely finish - his first for the club since joining on loan from Barcelona in August - Wolves' second goal was a disaster for Everton.\nThe Toffees have conceded goals from set-pieces all season and when Michael Keane gave away a needless free-kick, Joao Moutinho found an unmarked Jimenez to head home.\nIt got worse, Leander Dendoncker sealing a thoroughly deserved three points for Wolves with a volley.\nEverton are already enduring the longest trophy-free period in the club's history. They now face a mediocre mid-table finish unless Silva can sort his team out quickly.\nAre Wolves 'best of the rest'?\nThe season just gets better and better for impressive Wolves.\nLast season's second-tier champions can add Everton to the number teams they have beaten away from home - a list which includes West Ham, Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Tottenham.\nThis was as good a performance as Nuno Espirito Santo's side have produced since winning promotion.\nWolves were sharp, clinical and full of creativity on Merseyside as they scored three or more goals in three consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since March 1980.\nThey require two more points to reach 40 - but Wolves' ambitions stretch way beyond just staying up.\nThe Black Country club are seven points behind sixth-placed Manchester United with around one-third of the campaign left.\nMan of the match - Diogo Jota (Wolves)\n'We are not looking at the table' - what the managers said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo:\n\"We are proud of the work we did. We were better in the first half and in the second half both teams were organised.\n\"It requires a lot of shape and being compact but when we achieved the third goal the game was done for us.\n\"There is a long way to go and we can improve. We are not looking at the table until we go again.\"\nEverton's poor run against teams above them - the stats\nEverton have won just one of their nine Premier League games this season against teams starting the day higher than them in the table - losing the last five in a row.\nWolves have won 11 Premier League games this season - their joint-highest tally in a single Premier League campaign.\nEverton's Andre Gomes scored his first Premier League goal in what was his 17th appearance in the competition.\nWolves' Raul Jimenez has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other Wolves player this season (nine goals, five assists).\nWhat's next?\nIt doesn't get any easier for Everton. Manchester City visit Goodison Park on Wednesday in the Premier League (19:45 GMT), while Wolves are in action on Tuesday when they entertain League One Shrewsbury in an FA Cup fourth-round replay."

Apart from the goals, he is really very suitable to play very close to Eden.\"\nArgentina international Higuain opened the scoring in the 16th minute at Stamford Bridge.\nN'Golo Kante played him in with a delightful reverse pass to beat the offside trap and the striker finished first time, lashing his shot in at the near post.\nJust before half-time Elias Kachunga nudged Cesar Azpilicueta over and referee Paul Tierney awarded a penalty, although replays suggested the foul occurred outside the penalty area.\nHazard stepped up to smash in the penalty and score his first league goal since 26 December.\nThe Belgium international made it 3-0 on 66 minutes, rounding Terriers keeper Jonas Lossl and slotting in from a tight angle.\nAnd just three minutes later Higuain got his second, curling in a shot from the edge of the area, with the help of a deflection.\nDavid Luiz added a fifth in the closing minutes, with a powerful header from a corner that was deflected into his own net by Kachunga.\nThe win ended a troubled week for Sarri, following Wednesday's 4-0 loss to Bournemouth - their heaviest league defeat in 23 years.\nChelsea are now fourth, three points ahead of Arsenal, who play Manchester City on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nBut it is an 11th defeat in 12 league games for the Terriers, who remain bottom of the league and 13 points from safety.\nRelive Chelsea's thrashing of Huddersfield\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League action\nGoals finally flow for Chelsea\nChelsea came into the game having lost successive league matches against Arsenal and Bournemouth.\nIn recent weeks Sarri has questioned their motivation and Wednesday's defeat led to an angry dressing room inquest.\nHis players gave the perfect response against Huddersfield, with a free-flowing attacking performance in what felt like a must-win game.\nChelsea had failed to score in three of their past four league games going into Saturday's match, which was why Sarri brought in Higuain.\nThe 31-year-old, who had scored just eight goals in 22 appearances for AC Milan in the first half of the season, showed Chelsea exactly what he can bring to the side with clinical finishing.\nHiguain played under Sarri while at Napoli in 2015-16, equalling the Serie A goalscoring record with 36 goals.\nHe continued his remarkable scoring record under Sarri on his home league debut, with his 37th and 38th goals in 37 league games for the Italian.\nSarri has previously said Hazard \"has to do more\" and the 28-year-old put in a performance to please his boss.\nHe was a constant menace in attack, terrorising the Terriers' defence as he was given the run of Stamford Bridge and taking his goal tally to 15 for the season.\nSarri said: \"Today is all positive, we played a full 90 minutes, defended very well, so it was a very good match but we need consistency now, we have to continue to play with the same mentality in all the matches.\n\"I hope in the future we will not need to lose a match to find the right mentality.\"\nMatch of the Day analysis\nJermaine Jenas said: \"Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higuain are two world class players and when they get on that wave length with each other, great things can happen.\n\"It was very telepathic at times between the two of them. Higuain likes to drop deep at times and Hazard likes to run with it.\n\"Higuain came alive inside the area for the first goal but he linked up everything really well. If Maurizio Sarri can get a tune out of him that will be great.\n\"Hazard was ruthless and his finish for the second goal makes it look simple.\"\nBlunt Terriers fail to fire again\nThis was Jan Siewert's first away game in charge since succeeding David Wagner as Terriers boss and he was able to welcome back Aaron Mooy and Philip Billing.\nBut a change in manager has not solved their biggest problem, which is a lack of a goalscorer.\nStuck on just 13 league goals this season, they never looked like adding to that tally at Stamford Bridge, registering just two shots on target from five attempts.\nMooy had the best effort, heading over in the seventh minute, but that was as good as it got.\nThey also struggled in defence and were outclassed by Hazard, Higuain and Kante.\nWith just two wins all this season, they seem destined for a return to the Championship.\n\"I don't feel well at the moment because we lost 5-0 and we cannot compete with Chelsea,\" said Siewert.\n\"I think when you look at the game we had the first chance then conceded early and the penalty came at the wrong moment. I'm not sure if it was a penalty.\n\"We will not talk about these decisions because we lost 5-0 and this doesn't feel good. We had the first chance and had several moments but missed our shots. We have to be more aggressive in the box to go for our goals.\"\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\nStats - Stamford Bridge becomes a fortress\nChelsea have only lost one of their past 16 home Premier League games (won nine, drawn six)\nHuddersfield have failed to score in a league-high 13 different Premier League games this season.\nChelsea scored five goals in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2017, when they beat Stoke 5-0 at Stamford Bridge\nHiguain became the first Chelsea player to score twice on their home league debut for the club since Mario Stanic v West Ham in August 2000\nKante provided two assists in a single league match for the first time in his top-flight career.\nWhat's next\nChelsea travel to reigning champions Manchester City on Sunday, 10 February (16:00 GMT), while Huddersfield host Arsenal next Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

I couldn't have asked for more.\n\"We were very good and couldn't have done any more to win or score. Their keeper was in good form.\n\"They're a good side, they defend well and caused us problems. On the bulk of the game we were the better side. I'm disappointed and frustrated but not frustrated with the endeavours of our team.\n\"Maybe a lack of confidence and quality, luck or fortune [for some players]. Maybe they need a scruffy one to go in. What you need is to make sure you get in those positions. If we hadn't created chances today, I'd be more worried and frustrated. On another day, the goals will come.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia to BBC Sport: \"After the game I think the point is good. But we wanted to win today. I think in the first half we had game under control and didn't suffer a lot.\n\"But in the second half when game was open, they created more chances than us.\n\"We tried but we didn't play offensively.\"\nOn the prospects of a top-half finish: \"At the end of the season, I don't only want to see the table to be satisfied with my players. If we do our best, I think we have many chances to achieve something special. Not only if we finish ninth, 10th or 11th - other things are more important.\"\nGracia sets Premier League record for Watford - the stats\nBrighton have failed to score in three consecutive home games in all competitions (W0 D2 L1) for the first time since January 2016.\nThis was Watford manager Javi Gracia's 39th Premier League game in charge of the Hornets, more than any other manager for the club in the competition.\nWatford failed to direct a single shot on target for the only the second time in their last 53 Premier League games, and for the first time in 11 in the competition.\nBrighton have never lost a Premier League game in February (W2 D2), one of just two teams to be unbeaten in a single month in the competition's history (Blackpool W2 D0 L0 in December).\nTwo of Watford's last three Premier League games have finished goalless, as many as in their previous 57 in the competition.\nBrighton have won just one of their last 10 Premier League games, drawing three and losing six.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to West Brom for an FA Cup fourth-round replay on Wednesday, 6 February (20:05 GMT).

Every point is so valuable and if you're in the lead you can't stop playing and worry about the final whistle.\"\nFulham have now lost 16 of their 25 Premier League games this campaign and they remain 19th - seven points clear of safety.\nRelive Crystal Palace's win over Fulham here\nFollow reaction to this afternoon's Premier League games here\nPalace grind their way to victory\nPrior to Fulham's visit to Selhurst Park, the Eagles had only claimed two wins from 11 home league games this season, despite their impressive away form.\nHowever, they won their first home match since mid-December by beating the Cottagers in a game of few chances.\nThe Eagles, who were without the suspended Wilfried Zaha, took the lead on 25 minutes when Milivojevic slotted home from the spot after Christie handballed as he went up for a header with Christian Benteke.\nAnd Benteke, who made his first start since September, almost doubled their lead on the brink of half-time, as his powerfully struck overhead kick cannoned back off the crossbar.\nBut while Fulham held most of the possession, they failed to create many openings, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka putting in a particularly impressive performance at right-back.\nFulham keeper Sergio Rico had to be alert in the second half to keep out efforts from Jordan Ayew and Schlupp at his near post while Mamadou Sakho headed wide when he should have scored.\nBut the Eagles did not extend their lead until the 87th minute when Schlupp was on hand to poke home after Batshuayi, who joined the club late on deadline day, had forced a superb save from Rico just minutes after coming on.\nFulham's wait for an away win goes on\nClaudio Ranieri said his side were \"alive\" in the battle against relegation following Tuesday night's impressive comeback win over Brighton, however, they failed to carry that momentum to Selhurst Park.\nDespite the fact they dominated possession for much of the first half, they were unable to prise open Palace's resolute defence with their only real chance falling to Aleksandar Mitrovic on 11 minutes, but he could only head wide.\nAnd, while they huffed and puffed in the second period, Palace keeper Vincente Guaita did not have a save of note to make.\nMitrovic, who scored twice in the Cottagers' midweek victory, was bereft of service throughout as his team-mates' final balls were poor time and time again.\n\"The service to Mitrovic was not good enough. We spoke a lot about crosses, crosses, crosses. I tried to do something - I put another striker on but it wasn't good,\" Ranieri said.\n\"The first half was good until the penalty, we had the match in our hands. But they deserved to win in the second half, they were better than us.\"\nThe result leaves Fulham still waiting for their first Premier League away win of the season - they have taken just two points on the road.\nAnd, while the record may not make for happy reading for Ranieri, the Italian himself is now 21 Premier League away matches without a win.\nMan of the match - Aaron Wan-Bissaka\n'I met my team-mates today' - what they said\nCrystal Palace forward Michy Batshuayi: \"It's a very important win, it's good for the team and for me too. I feel good to be here but I need to train with the team. It's a good start.\n\"I met my team-mates today! I will bring as much as I can to help the team to win.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"In the second half we played well - first half I have to give Fulham credit, they were very good and we were fortunate. It was a strange penalty, I can't understand what has gone through the defender's head.\n\"We look more dangerous from corners - there are positives for us. Michy Batshuayi did so well to create the second goal. We will need these players who came on.\"\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We were controlling the match in the first half but the penalty changed the match.\n\"We were in trouble from the beginning but we will continue to be positive, be strong. It's important to be optimistic. We have a target in our mind.\"\n'Babel and Cairney have got to do more'\nAnalysis: Former England striker Alan Shearer on Match of the Day\nApart from one chance for Aleksandar Mitrovic, Fulham did not have a shot on target. They are so reliant on him. He has got 40% of their goals.\nRyan Babel and Tom Cairney have got to do more and cause more problems. On every occasion it was a ball into the box and Mitrovic was the only one there. They could still be playing now and Fulham would not have scored.\nCottagers' London derby woes continue - the best stats\nFulham are the first side in English top-flight history to lose eight consecutive London derby matches.\nThey have conceded more away goals than any other Premier League team this season (32).\nCrystal Palace have won just two of their last 14 Premier League London derbies (W2 D3 L9), with both victories coming against Fulham.\nPalace's Jeffrey Schlupp has scored as many Premier League goals this season (4) as he did in his previous four campaigns combined (99 apps).\nSince his Premier League debut for Palace, Luka Milivojevic has scored more goals than any other player at the club (19).\nPalace have done the league double over Fulham for the first time since the 1929-30 season.\nWhat's next?\nFulham face Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Manchester United at Craven Cottage in next Saturday's early game (12:30 GMT), while Palace host West Ham later that day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Cardiff City 2-0 Bournemouth: Bluebirds win as they pay tribute to Emiliano Sala\nCardiff City produced one of their best performances of the season to secure a vital Premier League victory thanks to Bobby Reid's double on an emotional night in the Welsh capital.\nThis was the first opportunity for Bluebirds fans to pay a full tribute to striker Emiliano Sala, who is missing after the plane carrying him and pilot David Ibbotson disappeared near Guernsey 12 days ago.\nAn underwater search begins on Sunday.\nAmid touching scenes, Cardiff excelled on the pitch, racing into an early lead when Reid coolly dispatched a penalty after Steve Cook inexplicably handled.\nBirthday boy Reid scored again after just 15 seconds of the second half when he raced clear and slotted home, ensuring a morale-boosting win for the wounded Bluebirds.\nIt was Cardiff's first win in five league games and moves them two points from safety in 18th position, while Bournemouth stay in 10th.\n'We will love you forever more' - read more about Sala tributes here\nCardiff pays tribute to Sala\nThe emotions were high all evening in the Welsh capital on a night of reflection.\nOutside the Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff's statue of Fred Keenor, their 1927 FA Cup-winning captain, remains a shrine to Sala, with tributes for the Argentine forward laid since his disappearance.\nA privately funded hunt for the plane was started after \u00a3324,000 was raised in a GoFundMe appeal, with several footballers contributing.\nCardiff's first home match since the disappearance represented a chance for City fans to express their sadness collectively and there were emotional scenes before during and after the game, not for the first time this season.\nThis should have been a season-long celebration for the promoted-Bluebirds, but this is the second time this term a home game has been overshadowed by tragic events away from the football pitch.\nIn November, Cardiff hosted Leicester City in the first match since the helicopter crash that claimed the lives of their chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four other people. It was an afternoon when football seemed both an irrelevance and a form of release for Leicester's grieving players and fans.\nManager Neil Warnock was keen to point out the importance of this match and Cardiff's need to move forward, but the tributes to Sala were a feature of the evening.\nThe Bluebirds' shirts were adorned with embroidered daffodils, with every supporter also receiving a flower as they entered the stadium. Before kick-off there was a 'moment of reflection' that was impeccably observed and Sala's name was sung by the supporters throughout as verses of \"Sing a song for Sala, we will never let you go, you will always be, at City with me\" rang out.\nHowever, the ultimate tribute to Sala was paid by the Cardiff players after Reid's fifth-minute penalty. They quickly ran to the touchline to lift a shirt with his face embroidered on it, a personal moment from the players who would have dearly loved to have got to know their new team-mate.\nBournemouth insipid in response to mauling of Chelsea\nEddie Howe's side came into this contest on the back of their most impressive win of the campaign, a 4-0 thumping of Chelsea, but they never came close to matching those levels.\nIn the absence of injured Wales winger David Brooks, who is so integral to their attacking play - he has scored six and made four goals this term - they were less potent than usual, especially with England forward and Bournemouth's top scorer Callum Wilson also injured.\nThey did not register a shot until Ryan Fraser fired wide midway through the first period, although they came extremely close when Andrew Surman's 25-yard effort was brilliantly tipped onto the crossbar by Neil Etheridge.\nHowever, once Cardiff extended their advantage, the belief seemed to evaporate from Howe's side, despite them having over 70% possession.\nTheir passing was crisp, but in the final third they were ponderous and had no answer to Cardiff sitting deep with Aron Gunnarsson and Joe Ralls screening their back four, though Nathan Ake might have headed home Jordan Ibe's free-kick, only to miss the target.\nCardiff thrive after close of transfer window\nThe Bluebirds' transfer window was one of anguish due to the Sala situation, but their first performance since gave cause for optimism.\nOn-loan signing Oumar Niasse might have scored after two minutes, but his heavy touch narrowed his angle and allowed Artur Boruc to save with his legs.\nHowever, Niasse certainly added a new dimension to Cardiff's attack and, but for a poor pass approaching half-time, he might have presented Reid with a tap-in.\nThe Bluebirds, who led at half-time for the first time all season, enjoyed a dream start to the second period when Reid beat the offside trap and latched onto a hopeful Gunnarsson ball to round Boruc before firing home - the perfect way to celebrate turning 26.\nMan of the match - Bobby Reid\nStats - Cardiff's clean sheets\nCardiff picked up their first Premier League victory in five games (drawn one, lost three), with this their first win by more than one goal since October (4-2 v Fulham).\nBournemouth have lost their past seven Premier League away games, conceding at least twice in each match.\nCardiff have kept back-to-back home clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time.\nScored just 15 seconds into the second half, Reid's second goal for Cardiff was the fastest scored after half-time in the Premier League since Marko Arnautovic for West Ham v Huddersfield in January 2018 (11 seconds).\nReid became the third player to score a Premier League goal on his birthday this season, after Ricardo Pereira (Leicester v Everton) and Anthony Martial (Manchester United v Arsenal).\nWhat's next?\nCardiff travel to Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT) with the Saints just two points above them in the table, while Bournemouth face league leaders Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday (15:00)."

Leicester, meanwhile, stay in 11th.\nRelive United's win at the King Power Stadium\nSanchez struggles for United\nThis was a case of United getting the job done, without ever really moving up through the gears.\nAgainst Burnley, Solskjaer's starting XI had struggled in attack and he swung the axe for the trip to Leicester with Romelu Lukaku dropped to the bench as one of four changes.\nAlexis Sanchez, Jesse Lingard, Ander Herrera and Eric Bailly returned to the team and United started on the front foot.\nRashford missed a close-range header in the fourth minute, before making amends with his goal.\nSanchez started on the left side of the attack and barely contributed in his 67 minutes on the pitch, cutting an isolated figure and failing to register a shot.\nBut Solskjaer defended the Chilean, saying: \"He worked really well defensively. He is improving all the time.\"\nAlthough dominant for large parts of the game, United only mustered six attempts on target.\nFour of those came in the first half, while it took until the 87th minute for their first shot on target in the second half, an easy save by Schmeichel from Lukaku, on as a late substitute.\nAnd there were nervous moments at the end of the match as Leicester pushed for an equaliser.\nBut another clean sheet and their ninth win in 10 games under Solskjaer continued their momentum under the Norwegian, with a tricky run of fixtures coming up including Paris St-Germain in the Champions League, Chelsea in the FA Cup and Liverpool in the Premier League.\n\"Our attitude was spot on,\" Solskjaer told Sky Sports. \"There are a couple of bruised noses and knees.\n\"It is supposed to be like this. There are three points on the line. Our lads sacrificed everything they had. They know they can do better than this but a clean sheet is always a foundation to build on.\"\nFoxes fail to recover from early blow\nThe Foxes have performed well against top-six sides, with a draw at Anfield and wins against Chelsea and Manchester City.\nBut they failed to build on that momentum and continued their dreadful home record, losing their third consecutive game at the King Power.\nThe home fans will also have been disappointed to see midfielder Youri Tielemans, who joined on loan from Monaco on deadline day, left out of the match-day squad.\nLeicester paid the price for a slow start, but responded well after conceding early, finishing the first half the stronger and continuing to threaten after the break.\nJames Maddison was their most dangerous attacking player, but he was replaced by Ghezzal after just the hour mark - an unpopular move with the home fans by manager Claude Puel.\nThe Frenchman defended his decision, saying: \"We have to find a solution. We have players on the bench who have quality.\"\nA flurry of chances fell the home team's way in the dying minutes, with Vardy missing with a weak shot and Harry Maguire shooting wide in the 94th minute.\nThe pressure will remain on Puel, who is now without a win since 1 January, a run of six games.\n\"We started the game with a poor performance and without intensity,\" he added. \"It was a shame. In the second half we showed a lot of things with more desire and quality in our play.\n\"We put them under pressure at the end of the game but it was not enough.\"\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba\nSolskjaer leads the league - the best stats\nUnited have won five consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time since October 2012.\nLeicester have lost more Premier League games against United (17) than they have against any other side.\nSince Solskjaer's first game in charge of United on 22 December, Pogba has had a hand in more Premier League goals than any other player (11 - six goals, five assists).\nLeicester have lost four of their last five games in all competitions, as many as they had lost in their previous 15 matches combined.\nRashford has scored more goals in all competitions since his debut (42) than any other United player.\nUnited have won four more points than any other Premier League team since Solskjaer's first match in charge (won seven, drawn one - 22 points).\nOnly Ryan Giggs (21 years and 74 days) has reached 100 Premier League appearances for United at a younger age than Rashford (21 years and 95 days).\nWhat's next?\nUnited travel to Fulham on Saturday (12:30 GMT), while Leicester face Tottenham at Wembley on Sunday (13:30)."

After the game in Newcastle, Liverpool were seven points ahead and now they are two.\n\"Of course they have to play, they have quality, but West Ham [who Liverpool face on Monday] are a good side.\n\"Now we have tomorrow to start again and think about Everton and after Chelsea. It is a tough week for us and we go game by game.\"\nArsenal boss Unai Emery: \"We are going to go game by game and thinking 'win the next match' and maybe if we win we can take the opportunity in the near future to be near the other teams and play with this motivation.\n\"The difference between City and us is like this result. We need to do our work. Not a big frustration at moment, the result is the difference.\n\"They showed their superiority in 90 minutes. They held their level in 90 minutes and our level in the second half was worse than the first.\"\nCan we play you every week? - the stats\nManchester City have won four consecutive top-flight games against Arsenal for the first time since April 1937.\nSince the start of 2018, only two teams have lost more away games than Arsenal (12) in the Premier League - Brighton (14) and Huddersfield (13).\nCity have won eight of their nine games in all competitions in 2019, scoring 34 goals and conceding four.\nSergio Aguero has been directly involved in 27 goals in his past 15 home starts in the Premier League - 22 goals, 5 assists.\nAguero has scored both of the two quickest goals in the Premier League this season - 24 seconds v Newcastle and 46 seconds v Arsenal.\nCity's opening goal after 46 seconds was the quickest that Arsenal have conceded in a Premier League game since December 2014.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City could be top of the Premier League table by the end of Wednesday. If Liverpool don't beat West Ham on Monday and City win at Everton two days later (19:45 GMT), there will be a new leader.

Tottenham are also in the title hunt following three successive league wins - they have 57 points, five behind the Reds.\nThere are also increasing injury concerns for Liverpool, with Dejan Lovren, Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum joining Joe Gomez and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the sidelines.\n\"Last night we trained and after we had to change three positions,\" said Klopp.\n\"It's just a fact, it's not an excuse. The preparation for the game was far from being perfect and we still got a point.\"\nIt started well for Liverpool at London Stadium when Sadio Mane fired past Lukasz Fabianski in the 22nd minute, although James Milner was in an offside position in the build-up.\nThe Hammers showed enough threat in attack to suggest it would not be one-way traffic though, and six minutes later they got a deserved equaliser when Liverpool's defence failed to read Felipe Anderson's disguised free-kick that picked out Michail Antonio's run into the area.\nThe English winger equalised with a low angled drive that went in off the post.\nLiverpool did not put the West Ham defence under severe pressure, with two efforts from Mohamed Salah and a header from Mane comfortably dealt with by Fabianski before Divock Origi shot straight at the keeper when he had a clear sight of goal right at the end.\n'Klopp believes referee was affected by offside error\nGomez to have surgery on leg fracture\nKlopp is used to winning with offside goals - West Ham boss Pellegrini\nFootball Daily: West Ham burst Liverpool's bubble\nReds attack fails to fire\nIt was a match where very little went right for Klopp's side at either end of the pitch after Mane's opener.\nAdam Lallana outmanoeuvred a couple of defenders on the right before playing a pass to the overlapping Milner. The 33-year-old was a yard ahead of the final defender, but there was no flag and his square ball found Mane who turned and fired in.\nFabianski had little else to do until the final kick of the game when substitute Origi, who also looked offside, struck his effort straight at the Poland keeper from six yards.\nThe attack might have lacked its usual potency on Monday, but it was his side's defensive display that would have most concerned Klopp.\nHammers take advantage of defensive lapses\nThe best defence in the league looked amateurish at London Stadium, as they repeatedly failed to track runners from free-kicks.\nAntonio was the first to catch the Reds napping as they appeared set for Anderson to play a high ball into the area. Instead the Brazilian sent a low pass into the path of the English winger's diagonal run and Antonio fired past Allison.\nThe jolt should have made the visitors wary of a repeat, but soon after the goal they experienced further lapses when Anderson was allowed to slip around the side of a wall and get a shot away while Declan Rice also headed over when unmarked.\nSome would point to the absence of injured defensive trio Lovren, Gomez and Alexander-Arnold, but they did have player of the year contender Virgil van Dijk marshalling the backline.\nIt is Bournemouth next for Liverpool and then the stiff tests of Bayern Munich and Manchester United to come later this month.\nAs for West Ham, they ended a run of three straight defeats in all competitions but perhaps will feel aggrieved not to win.\nAside from the goal and Rice's miss, both Aaron Cresswell and Javier Hernandez went close with angled strikes while Antonio should have elected to shoot instead of pass after another drive into the area.\nManuel Pellegrini's side remain in 12th but they are now level on points with 11th-placed Leicester.\nMan of the match - Felipe Anderson (West Ham)\nMilner surpasses Beckham - the stats\nWest Ham are unbeaten in three consecutive home Premier League games (W1 D2) for the first time since February 2018 (a run of four).\nLiverpool have taken 62 points from their opening 25 Premier League games this season - only during the 1987-88 campaign have they had more points at this stage of a top-flight season (63 - three points for a win).\nMane has scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances for Liverpool for only the second time, also doing so in August 2017 (a run of four).\nMane has scored three goals in his past three Premier League appearances, having scored just two in his previous 11 games.\nMilner has registered 81 assists in the Premier League, the seventh-highest total in the competition and one more than David Beckham (80).\nAntonio has scored four goals in his five Premier League games against Liverpool, more than he has managed against any other side.\nLiverpool's Naby Keita has made more Premier League appearances without losing a game than any other player in the competition's history (18 games, 14 wins, four draws).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are at home to Bournemouth on Saturday and the Hammers are at Crystal Palace (both 15:00 GMT). The Reds' closest challengers, Manchester City, are at Everton on Wednesday (19:45) before hosting fourth-placed Chelsea on Sunday (16:00)."

Now we are top of the league. That is the best advice, the lesson is never give up,\" said Guardiola.\n\"That is a lesson for all athletes. Try to win the games, because life can change immediately.\"\nDefender Aymeric Laporte met David Silva's free-kick to head home his fourth goal of the season, putting City in front just before half-time.\nSergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling both spurned decent opportunities to extend City's lead after the break before Gabriel Jesus sealed victory in stoppage time.\nIt was far from a vintage display by City, who instead had to show their battling qualities to secure the points and regain the initiative in the title race.\nAttention will now switch back to Liverpool, who can return to the summit with victory against Bournemouth on Saturday, 24 hours before City host Chelsea at Etihad Stadium.\nEverton stay ninth after suffering a fourth defeat in five Premier League games at Goodison Park, though they should take some encouragement from a resilient display that was a notable improvement on their performances in recent weeks.\nWe'll give fans what they deserve - Everton boss Silva\nAdvantage Manchester City? - Football Daily podcast\nAdvantage City as title race takes latest twist\nJust seven days ago, Manchester City faced the prospect of falling seven points behind leaders Liverpool after slipping to a fourth Premier League defeat of the season against Newcastle the previous evening.\nKlopp's side missed that opportunity after drawing with Leicester, and a further draw at West Ham on Monday opened the door for City to return to the top for the first time in almost seven weeks.\nGuardiola's side appeared determined to make an impression at Goodison Park, creating three good chances in the opening 20 minutes, with Leroy Sane and Laporte going close before Ilkay Gundogan hit the bar.\nCity faded after that bright opening but made the breakthrough as half-time approached. David Silva's free-kick from the left-hand side of the penalty area was headed in by the unmarked Laporte for his first Premier League goal since August.\nAguero and Sterling missed further chances after the break to ensure a nervy finish, though Everton, despite all their effort, failed to truly test Ederson in the Manchester City goal.\nVictory was sealed seconds from full-time - Jesus heading home at the second attempt after Jordan Pickford had done well to block his initial shot.\nThe result puts further pressure on Liverpool who, after a near-flawless campaign so far, have started to show signs of fallibility in recent weeks as they chase a first league title for 29 years.\nThree successive league victories have also pushed Tottenham back in contention. Mauricio Pochettino's side are just five points behind the top two and still have to visit Anfield and Etihad Stadium before the end of the season.\nTonight's win means City have the initiative, but the dramatic change in fortunes over the past week suggests this is just the latest twist in an increasingly unpredictable title race.\nEverton restore pride - but familiar failings let them down\nEverton fans will have been aware that a win at Goodison Park would have been a huge favour to neighbours Liverpool.\nBut there were no signs of divided loyalties at kick-off with the home crowd fully behind their side, and they are likely to be encouraged by a hard-working performance, even if it ultimately resulted in another defeat.\nManager Marco Silva sprang a surprise by making five changes to his team as he looked for a response to Saturday's defeat by Wolves.\nThese included dropping top scorers Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson to the bench and switching to a 4-3-3 formation.\nHe was rewarded with a more spirited display, with the returning Idrissa Gueye bringing some much needed energy back into the Everton midfield.\nHowever, familiar failings cost the Toffees before the break.\nEverton had conceded 18 goals from set-pieces in all competitions this season, more than any other Premier League side. And that soon became 19 when Laporte was left completely unmarked to meet David Silva's free-kick and nod the champions in front on the stroke of half-time.\nSilva brought on Richarlison, Sigurdsson and Cenk Tosun in an attempt to get back into the game, but their only shot on target was a long-range effort from Gueye that was comfortably held by Ederson.\nThe result means a tally of nine defeats in 15 games in all competitions for Silva's side - an alarming slump in form after starting December in the top six.\nSince their defeat at Liverpool on 2 December, the Toffees have collected just 11 points - only the Premier League's bottom two, Huddersfield Town and Fulham, have earned fewer.\nThere were signs of improvement against the champions, but Silva knows he needs to turn performances into points quickly if Everton's season is not to peter out completely before the clocks go forward.\nMan of the Match - Aymeric Laporte (Manchester City)\n'The players have shown incredible desire' - what the managers said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We come from champions and we are in a situation where we could have given up but it didn't happen.\n\"We gave an incredible game against Liverpool. These players have shown incredible desire and performances for the last two years. How could I question them?\n\"We have played one more game. but it's the best we can do. The reality is one month ago we could have been 10 points behind when we played Liverpool.\"\nEverton manager Marco Silva: \"There are positives but again we didn't take the points we want and we are working to achieve. At the moment bad things come too easy, we concede after 47 and 97 minutes. Just working like we did tonight, things will change for us, I am really positive. The team showed what we must do.\n\"The fans are so good, at the end of the match what they did for our players, I don't have doubts. We are all together and we will give them what they want and what they deserve.\n\"Everything was different compared to Wolves, I have to be honest. This has to be our image as a team. We must be consistent, it is an obligation for us. A desire to win, an aggression - it is what we have to do every time against every team.\n\"You have to respect every team. Be aggressive at set-pieces. We were in the zone we must be in, we moved a little bit, it was a good delivery and header but we have to challenge. I have to speak with my players about this, it is not normal.\n\"I cannot understand why we must play tonight, it is very tough for us.\"\nCity go top again - the stats\nManchester City will end the day top of the Premier League for the first time since 15 December 2018, when they were top after a win over Everton.\nEverton have conceded more goals from set pieces than any other Premier League team in all competitions this season (19).\nManchester City have scored with their first shot on target in 15 Premier League games this season - six more than any other team.\nAll four of Aymeric Laporte's goals in all competitions for Manchester City this season have been headers from set pieces in away matches.\nEverton are yet to win a Premier League match when conceding first this season (P12 W0 D2 L10).\nMarco Silva has now lost five Premier League games against Manchester City - two more than he has against any other opponent.\nEverton made five line-up changes for this match - their most between Premier League matches under manager Marco Silva.\nManchester City have won 10 of their last 11 matches in all competitions (L1), scoring 39 goals and conceding just five.\nWhat's next?\nEverton face a trip to Marco Silva's former side Watford on Saturday (15:00 GMT). Manchester City host Chelsea the following day (16:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-3 Manchester United: Pogba and Martial goals take visitors into top four\nConfident Manchester United moved into the Premier League's top four with a dominant win over struggling Fulham at Craven Cottage.\nAnthony Martial was in sensational form, making the first for Paul Pogba and scoring a wonderful second as United secured their 10th victory in 11 games under caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nPogba wrapped up the points in the second half when he stroked home from the penalty spot after Juan Mata was fouled in the area.\nDespite fielding a much-changed defence, they were rarely troubled by a Fulham team who have now conceded 58 goals this season and remain firmly entrenched in the relegation zone.\nUnited on the other hand have moved above Chelsea on 51 points with their recent stunning form pushing them into the hunt for an end-of-season Champions League spot.\nPogba's brilliance defines United\nPogba's resurgence under Solskjaer has been well documented and his performance at Craven Cottage epitomised the way he has played under the Norwegian.\nTwo more goals took his season's tally to 13 - seven of them have been scored in nine Premier League games under Solskjaer - and he completely ran the game for Manchester United.\nWith just 13 minutes on the clock, he latched onto Martial's through ball and from a tight angle smashed the ball high into the top corner of Sergio Rico's net.\nHe continued to stroll around the pitch with the swagger and skill expected of a \u00a389m World Cup winner, dovetailing neatly with Martial to strengthen the case that he is the best midfielder in the Premier League at the moment.\nAnd after Mata was clumsily pulled down by Maxime Le Marchand on 64 minutes, Pogba picked up the ball and coolly slotted the penalty into the bottom right corner.\nWith the game won, Solskjaer withdrew his star man to protect him for big tests coming up, not least Paris St-Germain in the Champions League last 16 at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.\nFeeble Fulham continue to struggle\nClaudio Ranieri's side have now lost five of their last six games and a return to the Championship looks all the more likely after this display.\nIt could all have been very different if the Cottagers had scored in the opening minute. From a Manchester United attack, the Cottagers broke quickly and Andre Schurrle picked out Luciano Vietto at the back post. The Italian though could only carelessly screw his shot wide.\nSchurrle himself could have scored moments later but he too was off target when well placed.\nThat was as good as it got for Fulham who showed no signs of repeating their incredible comeback from two goals down to beat Brighton in their previous home match.\nIndeed, Mitrovic's twisting header on 72 minutes was the only time they tested United keeper David de Gea in the second half.\nRyan Babel summed up their afternoon when he could only hit the post from a yard out, to the great joy of the United fans situated behind the goal.\nOn this evidence, Ranieri has a lot of work to do to salvage their season as they sit seven points from safety with just 12 games left.\nShouts of 'You don't know what you're doing' from his own fans when he withdrew Schurrle early in the second half will not help their cause.\nGames against West Ham and Southampton will be vital before an intimidating March run of fixtures against Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City.\nSolskjaer's changes pay off\nSolskjaer seemed to have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League match and made six changes to the side that won last time out at Leicester.\nWith Marcus Rashford and Alexis Sanchez rested, replacements Martial and Romelu Lukaku improved their chances of featuring in that game with a performance full of threat.\nMartial in particular was in dynamic form, tormenting Fulham's stand-in right back Denis Odoi throughout and scoring a marvellous goal after a run from inside his own half.\nSolskjaer also shuffled his defenders as Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, fresh from signing new long-term deals at Old Trafford, reprised their centre-back partnership.\nAnd, despite a few shaky moments early on, they easily handled the feisty Mitrovic and cruised to a sixth consecutive away victory in all competitions for the first time since May 2009.\nSolskjaer even had the luxury of withdrawing Pogba and Martial with 20 minutes left, two Frenchmen who will relish the challenge posed by runaway Ligue 1 leaders PSG.\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\nWhat they said\nFulham manager Claudio Ranieri: We created two great chances in the first 10 minutes but after we conceded we gave it to them and lost our composure. When you play against big champions you can make mistakes.\nI tried to give my players more opportunities by playing with two strikers and Ryan Babel in behind. We didn't create anything very dangerous and the penalty finished the match.\nOn Andre Schurrle's substitution: I know the fans were not happy but I had two players with flu in the week, including Andre Schurrle. I can understand the fans always want their players to play but it's not always possible.\nWe will work to try and win our next two games. We're always positive.\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: The first 10 minutes we made it hard for ourselves but the last 80 minutes pleased me. We managed the game well which you have to do away from home and we played some fantastic football.\nThe players have some fantastic qualities. I've supported United for many years and as a United fan you go into every game thinking you're going to win it. We're on a great run but I think the players are feeling the same.\nWe know how good Paul Pogba is and he scored a great goal.\nWe want to keep moving forward and hang onto this fourth place. When you win games, you're always happy and I think the crowd will enjoy the trip home.\nManchester United midfielder Paul Pogba: We've played better but getting two quick goals in the first half changed the game. Ole helps every player play at their best. Ole is himself. He's not acting and he's given joy and confidence to everyone.\nThe team has a really good atmosphere. You can see on the pitch the effect.\nThere is a long way to go with big games coming up. We've got to focus on PSG and try and get points from the big teams.\nFulham's bogey team - the stats\nFulham have conceded 58 goals in 26 Premier League games this season; only three sides have shipped more at this stage in the history of the competition (Barnsley in 97/98 - 62, Swindon in 93/94 - 60 and Blackburn in 11/12 - 59).\nManchester United have won six consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time since May 2009.\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solksjaer has picked up 25 points in the Premier League since taking over in December (W8 D1), more than any other manager has managed in his first nine games in charge of a single club in the competition.\nFulham have lost 20 Premier League games against Manchester United, against no other team have they lost more (also 20 v Arsenal).\nManchester United have scored seven goals from the penalty spot in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nManchester United's Paul Pogba has reached double figures for goals for the first time ever in a single league campaign (11).\nAnthony Martial has now been directly involved in 50 Premier League goals (33 goals, 17 assists), more than any other Manchester United player since his debut in September 2015.\nVia his assist for Anthony Martial, Manchester United defender Phil Jones registered his first goal involvement in 87 Premier League appearances, since an assist against Norwich in April 2014.\nWhat's next?\nFulham have almost two weeks off before travelling across London to face West Ham on Friday, 22 February (20:00 GMT).\nManchester United will welcome Paris St-Germain to Old Trafford in the Champions League on Tuesday, 12 February (19:45 GMT) before an FA Cup fifth-round tie with Chelsea on Monday, 18 February at Stamford Bridge."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 1-2 Arsenal: Gunners maintain top-four hopes with comfortable win\nArsenal manager Unai Emery said finishing in a top-four spot will be \"difficult, but we can\" after his side's first away win since November at Premier League strugglers Huddersfield.\nThe result saw the Gunners, who remain sixth, move within a point of fourth-placed Manchester United and level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea, who face Manchester City on Sunday (16:00 GMT).\n\"We have played 26 games and there is one point between Manchester United and us,\" Emery said.\n\"If we ask 'is it easy or difficult for us?' then yes, I think it's difficult, but we can. We are on our way.\"\nOnce Alex Iwobi's strike deflected into the bottom right corner off defender Terence Kongolo, the visitors rarely looked like relinquishing the points in Yorkshire.\nAlexandre Lacazette's tidy finish from Ainsley Maitland-Niles' cross ensured victory despite a late Huddersfield fight-back.\nAfter Iwobi and Lacazette had squandered chances to increase Arsenal's winning margin, Adama Diakhaby and Laurent Depoitre both went close to scoring for the hosts.\nAnd while Saed Kolasinac's own goal represented the Terriers first, in 597 minutes of football, it was not enough to retrieve a point.\nHuddersfield remain marooned at the bottom of the table, 13 points from safety with 12 games remaining.\nFollow all the Premier League reaction\nArsenal put indifferent spell behind them\nArsenal arrived in West Yorkshire in the middle of an indifferent period of form, with three defeats in seven outings during 2019 underlining long-standing defensive issues.\nHowever, bottom club Huddersfield, with one home win all season, were the perfect opponents to get back on track against.\nFor all the Terriers' admirable qualities, their shortcomings, particularly in attack, allowed Unai Emery's side to brush off the absence of top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and win without being at their best.\nThe Gunners had won their last three matches against Huddersfield without conceding a goal and looked likely to repeat that feat until Sead Kolasinac inadvertently diverted Adama Diakhaby's effort into his own goal in added time.\nIn attack, Arsenal's thrust was generally provided down the flanks courtesy of right wing-back Ainsley Maitland-Niles and team-mate Kolasinac on the opposite side.\nThe Bosnian, who had the second most touches of any Arsenal player [70] behind Maitland-Niles [94], was the architect of the opening goal.\nHis strong running on the left was followed by a precision cross which allowed Iwobi to volley first time, albeit fortuitously, off Kongolo, into the bottom right corner from 10-yards out.\nMaitland-Niles then fashioned the second goal, racing clear on the right and sliding a perfectly weighted ball across the face of goal for Lacazette to score his 12th goal of the campaign.\nGallant losers again\nThe Huddersfield supporters must feel that their season is one long broken record.\nThis reverse, their 11th in 12 games, represented the 10th occasion that they have lost by a single goal. And, as in many of the others, they competed gallantly throughout and were deserving of their late goal but fell short in attack.\nWhile a muted first period only brought a penalty claim - waved away by referee Jonathan Moss - after Jason Puncheon's shot had hit Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny, they did improve after the break.\nGambling by putting more men forward left them susceptible to Arsenal on the counter, but also allowed them to finally carve out some clear chances.\nJuninho Bacuna could have dramatically levelled matters at the death and Adama Diakhaby was inches away from turning in from a corner midway through the half.\nHad Laurent Depoitre's right foot shot from 18 yards out found the bottom corner before Kolasinac's own goal, it would have set up a grandstand finish.\nInstead, the Terriers, who had not beaten Arsenal since 1971 - 11 years before their new coach Jan Siewert was born - succumbed to a familiar fate.\nMan of the match - Alex Iwobi (Arsenal)\n'We are closer to the top four' - what they said\nHuddersfield Town manager Jan Siewert speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"First of all I am proud. We played against Arsenal, one of the top teams in the table and we had many chances. We tried everything, we gave everything to win the game right until the end. How we created chances made me very proud.\n\"The most important thing is that I come in, in a very difficult situation. Judge us by our work and what the players are doing and this makes me proud. The supporters' applause makes me proud. I will fight until the end to keep these lads in the Premier League.\n\"I showed them the way they could play and, in two or three weeks it is a lot to do, but everyone is willing to do it.\n\"I won't judge about these (the referee's) decisions; it is our work the most important thing and it was a tight game, this was Arsenal.\n\"I have a lot to learn because on the video it is different. Every chat we have I get to learn them better.\n\"We are working on it as much as we can and they proved it today, the way we are creating these chance - and the fight comes first, everything else comes in the future.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"Good victory and good work; today I think our work was very good.\n\"We didn't win away from home in a long time and we are closer to the top four.\n\"A clean sheet is another thing we want before every match but we spoke about a lot of things about the match and the win is the first thing, we just had to score one goal more than them.\n\"The attitude is great from everybody.\"\nHuddersfield's first goal in 597 minutes - the stats\nArsenal are the only side without an away clean sheet in the Premier League this season.\nSead Kolasinac's own goal was Huddersfield's first goal in 597 minutes of football in all competitions, since Steve Mounie scored against Burnley in January.\nArsenal won their fifth away Premier League game of the season, one more than they managed on the road in the whole of 2017-18.\nHuddersfield are the first side to lose seven consecutive home Premier League games since Wolves in April 2012 (a run of nine).\nAlexandre Lacazette netted his first away goal in 10 games for Arsenal in all competitions since scoring twice at Fulham back in October.\nAlex Iwobi has a hand in 10 goals in all competitions for Arsenal this season (four goals, six assists) - his best return in a single campaign for the Gunners.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield travel to Newcastle in their next Premier League fixture on Saturday, 23 February (15:00 GMT).\nArsenal travel to Bate Borisov in the Europa League on Thursday, 14 February (17:55 GMT) before resuming their Premier League duties at home to Southampton on Sunday, 24 February (14:05 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-0 Everton: Hornets earn gritty victory\nWatford held off late pressure from Everton to claim a hard-fought victory over their former manager Marco Silva.\nMuch was promised of a game that saw Silva return to Vicarage Road for the first time, but neither side was able to take a strangle-hold of the game.\nHalf-time substitute Andre Gray scored the only goal of the match midway through the second half when he tapped in Will Hughes' low cross following a fine volleyed pass from Craig Cathcart.\nIn an otherwise tame affair, tempers flared after the final whistle when Kurt Zouma was shown two yellow cards for dissent.\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had earlier been alert to keep out Etienne Capoue and Gerard Deulofeu, while Ben Foster saved well to deny Cenk Tosun.\nAnd while the Toffees did twice rattle the woodwork in the second period - through Gylfi Sigurdsson's deft flick and Lucas Digne's free-kick - they did not apply any real pressure until the closing stages.\nSubstitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin twice should have done better with headers, but the Hornets deserve credit for how they defended.\nThe result consigns Everton to their third straight Premier League defeat, keeping them ninth, while Watford move four points clear of the Toffees in eighth.\nRelive Watford v Everton here\nWhat else happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nSilva's unhappy return\nSaturday marked Silva's first return to Vicarage Road since he was sacked by the Hornets at the end of the 2017-18 campaign.\nAnd while the Everton boss got the last laugh in December, when his former club were denied all three points at Goodison Park by Digne's 96th-minute equaliser, he certainly did not this time.\nHis team were lacklustre throughout and could have gone behind in the opening moments when Pickford made a fine save with his head to keep out Etienne Capoue from point-blank range.\nDeulofeu also saw a good chance blocked in the first half. But for all their efforts, the Hornets' opener did not come until the 65th minute, when Gray, who replaced Ken Sema at half-time, tapped home only his fourth league goal of the season.\nBefore that, the hosts had been slightly fortunate early in the second half when Sigurdsson's delicate lob hit the crossbar following a penalty area scramble.\nThey rode their luck again as the match drew to a close when Digne almost grabbed another late equaliser, but the woodwork came to Watford's rescue.\nHowever, Javi Gracia's side deserved their victory - which will no doubt bring them a great deal of pleasure at Silva and Everton's expense.\nEverton's struggles continue\nIn his pre-match news conference, Silva said Troy Deeney's derogatory comments at a midweek Fans' Forum event may have given his players motivation.\nBut that did not appear to be the case at Vicarage Road as his side struggled to gain a foothold in the first half and could have gone behind on more than one occasion if it had not been for Pickford.\nCenk Tosun, who returned to the starting XI alongside Sigurdsson and Richarlison, did have two half-chances in the opening 45 minutes, but neither seriously troubled Ben Foster in the Hornets' goal.\nAnd it did not get much better for Silva's side in the second half as Richarlison, playing against his former club, struggled to make an impact and was substituted on the hour, while the uncharacteristically quiet Sigurdsson was hooked shortly after.\nThe Toffees did improve following Bernard's introduction as the skilful Brazilian was able to break lines and drive forward where Richarlison had failed to do so, but for all his efforts they could not find an equaliser.\nDefeat means Everton have now lost three consecutive league games for the first time since January 2018, and pressure is mounting on Silva.\nMan of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford)\n'There was extra spice in the game' - what they said\nWatford goalscorer Andre Gray: \"With the ex-manager here there was extra spice in the game - especially with the fans. It pushes you on.\n\"In the second half we had that edge. We didn't play that well but we got over the line.\n\"Regardless of the 'edge' of the match, we would have gone for it because we were desperate for the win.\"\nEverton skipper Tom Davies: \"We dug in again. We're not happy and we have to look back on this match to see what we need to change.\n\"We underperformed again today - we had enough chances.\"\nGray ends his drought - the stats\nAndre Gray's opener for Watford ended a run of 10 Premier League appearances without a goal for the striker, his longest goal drought in the competition.\nWatford have won their last three home Premier League games against Everton - the first time they've won three in a row against an opponent at Vicarage Road in the competition.\nThe Hornets have registered three clean sheets in their last four Premier League games, as many as they managed in their previous 21 in the competition.\nEverton have lost seven of their last 11 Premier League away games (W3 D1), after losing just one of the six before that (W2 D3).\nMarco Silva has won just three of his 13 Premier League games at Vicarage Road (including 12 as Watford manager).\nWith his assist, Will Hughes registered a goal involvement on home soil for the first time in his last 13 Premier League appearances, his last being an assist against Bournemouth in March 2018.\nWhat's next?\nWatford now face a trip to Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup on Friday 15 February (19:45 GMT), while Everton are not in action until they travel to Cardiff on Tuesday 26 February (19:45 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth: Salah scores again as Reds regain Premier League lead\nLiverpool returned to the top of the Premier League with a composed display at Anfield that sent Bournemouth to an eighth successive away defeat.\nThree days after Manchester City moved top on goal difference, Jurgen Klopp's side responded in emphatic style to talk that the pressure of a title race was showing in their performances.\nAfter a cagey opening in which Ryan Fraser tested Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson, Sadio Mane settled any nerves by powerfully heading home James Milner's cross.\nMane, who looked fractionally offside, has now scored in four successive Premier League games for the first time.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum had not been allowed to stay in the Liverpool hotel on Friday because of illness but he was in fine form, doubling the lead with a sublime lob over the helpless Artur Boruc.\nMoments after the break, Naby Keita and Roberto Firmino combined in a move Klopp called \"world class\" to present Mohamed Salah with a simple finish from 10 yards, his 20th goal in all competitions this season.\nKlopp's side never looked in danger of losing their lead and moved on to 65 points, a tally which - with the exception of City's mark of 69 last season - would have been enough for at least a nine-point lead at the same stage of the title race in any of the previous four seasons.\nKey trio finding form?\nQuestions had been asked of the ability of Klopp's side to cope with the pressure of a title race after successive draws.\nBut here they crushed any hope Bournemouth might have had after a solid opening quarter, and Eddie Howe's side never looked capable of testing the nerve of the home side once they went behind.\nWhile Mane and Salah again got in the goals, Firmino's use of the ball was impressive throughout, never more so than when his superb flick sent Salah into the box after half-time, allowing the Egyptian to coolly round off a fine team move.\nSalah later rattled the bar from a delightful Firmino reverse-pass and only needs one more goal to reach 50 in the Premier League. Having played in only 62 matches, he looks set to beat Alan Shearer's record of reaching the mark in 66 games for a single club.\nIn all, Liverpool had 20 shots, with Mane guilty of missing a free header from 10 yards after the break and Firmino somehow wasting a chance when one-on-one with the keeper late on.\nAre Liverpool showing nerves? This result suggests not, though Bournemouth's lack of attacking ambition in a 4-4-1-1 system provided little for the home side to think about.\nBut the sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold coming off the bench to end a spell of injury will please Klopp, while his forward line of Firmino, Salah and Mane have now been responsible for 14 of the Reds' last 15 goals in the Premier League.\nIf Liverpool are to end their 29-year wait for a league title, that trio will need to maintain such form.\nPatched-up confusion for Howe\nBournemouth will look to Alisson's solid diving save from Fraser early on as evidence they were briefly in this game.\nTheir defensive set-up looked to be working, with the lack of space on offer between their back four and midfield five proving problematic for their hosts.\nBut when Mane got across the near post to head home, they simply looked confused as to how to respond.\nGiven their healthy mid-table status, they had little to lose but still opted for caution.\nWithout the goals and creativity of the injured Callum Wilson and David Brooks, they were devoid of ideas and looked like a side used to losing on the road.\nThey have now been beaten in eight consecutive away league matches for the first time since March 1984, when they were in the third tier.\nThe defeat means only bottom side Huddersfield and second-bottom Fulham - on 48 and 58 respectively - have conceded more than the 47 goals the Cherries have leaked this season.\nWhere next in the title race?\nIf Liverpool are feeling any nerves at this point, the run-in looks set to be a fraught one. Bookmakers make rivals Manchester City fractionally favourites at 10-11, with Liverpool close behind at even money.\nIn their remaining 13 matches, City host Chelsea, travel to rivals Manchester United and entertain Tottenham.\nLiverpool must play the same three sides but have the added challenge of an away Merseyside derby to contend with.\nAnd Tottenham face Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea in the run-in, with a north London derby against Arsenal thrown in for good measure.\nCity reached 100 points in 2017-18 and, at the current pace, it seems this year's title winners will need to post a points mark in the 90s if they are to prevail.\nMan of the match - Georginio Wijnaldum\nGeorginio Wijnaldum: Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp and James Milner praise midfielder's recovery\nFortress Anfield - Key stats\nLiverpool have only lost one of their 15 competitive matches against Bournemouth, winning 11 (D3)\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their last 34 Premier League home games, winning 24 and drawing 10\nLiverpool's James Milner has provided more assists in this Premier League season (4 in 21 apps) than he did in the 2017-18 campaign (3 in 32 apps).\nSince his Liverpool debut in August 2017, Andy Robertson has assisted more Premier League goals (11) than any other defender.\n'We have to convince' - what the managers said...\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to Match of the Day: \"We were not happy with the performances from the previous two games and struggled a bit with set-pieces. There were a lot of things we had to improve.\n\"We have high expectations and today we won in an impressive manner - we had some outstanding performances on the pitch. Goal number three was world class.\n\"We wanted to show a reaction. It's our job not only to come through but to really perform and convince.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"I thought Liverpool were very good but we didn't really deal with their main threats.\n\"The first goal was offside but we never really recovered. We pride ourselves in never quitting. We lived on the edge a little bit but looked more of a threat in the second half.\n\"We had some moments early in the match. We looked fine until that first goal went in.\"\nUp next?\nBoth sides have a weekend off next week, with Liverpool facing Bayern Munich in the Champions League last-16 on Tuesday, 19 February and Bournemouth facing Wolves at home four days later."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 Cardiff: Zohore goal lifts Bluebirds out of bottom three\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl says his side have \"no chance of staying in the league\" if they continue to perform as they did in Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by fellow strugglers Cardiff.\nKenneth Zohore struck in the third minute of stoppage time to earn the visitors all three points on an emotional afternoon for the Welsh side, who continue to mourn the death of record signing Emiliano Sala.\nJack Stephens looked to have rescued a point for the hosts moments earlier when he tapped Charlie Austin's flick-on past Neil Etheridge at the far post.\nSol Bamba had opened the scoring for Neil Warnock's side, beating Alex McCarthy from close range with the visitors' first effort on target.\nBurnley's victory at Brighton in Saturday's late game means Southampton slip into the bottom three for the first time since early January.\n\"Losing in that way is a brutal thing for me,\" said Hasenhuttl. \"It's unbelievable how easy we gave those points away.\n\"We did it last week [against Burnley] and the same again today. It can feel like a win if you draw like that, and then you give it away. That's stupid and unbelievable for me.\n\"But it doesn't change anything. We have to fight until the end, as I was saying in December.\n\"It's very narrow, very close, but that was clear in December and it doesn't change in February.\"\nThe win lifts Cardiff out of the relegation zone and into 15th place.\nCardiff emerge victorious on emotional day\nThe match at St Mary's was preceded by a minute's silence in memory of Sala, whose body was formally identified on Thursday after being recovered from the wreckage of the plane that crashed over the English Channel last month.\nFor the third game in succession, Cardiff players and staff wore yellow daffodils in honour of the Argentine striker, while the visitors also warmed up in T-shirts bearing Sala's image.\nWarnock said before the game that the struggling Bluebirds must be prepared for \"13 cup finals\" as they attempt to come to terms with the death of the former Nantes player, and the 70-year-old will have been proud of his side's resolute defending against their relegation rivals.\nEtheridge was the busier of the two goalkeepers, but Southampton were mainly restricted to shots from long range as the visitors stood firm.\nCardiff had barely threatened at the other end in the opening 65 minutes, but Bamba's goal against the run of play - a smart finish at the far post - sent the away supporters behind McCarthy's goal into raptures.\nTheir hopes of claiming three points appeared over when Stephens struck in second-half stoppage time, but Zohore's effort - his first of the season - ensured Cardiff recorded consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since April 1962.\nSaints misfiring\nHaving accused his players of \"giving two points away\" in last weekend's draw at Burnley, Ralph Hasenhuttl will be wondering how his side failed to claim at least a point here.\nThe hosts enjoyed 67% possession at St Mary's, but despite finding the target with seven of their 14 attempts they struggled to test Etheridge in the Cardiff goal.\nIn a first-half short on clear-cut opportunities, Nathan Redmond fired a low effort into the side-netting before Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg shot straight at Etheridge from the edge of the penalty area.\nThey went within a whisker of an equaliser when Lee Peltier cleared Charlie Austin's effort off the line, moments after Yan Valery had been thwarted by Etheridge when one-on-one.\nFew would have argued with the result had the game ended after Stephens' late equaliser, but the Saints failed to hang on as Zohore condemned them to their first league defeat since December.\nHaving picked up just two points from three games against fellow strugglers Crystal Palace, Burnley and Cardiff, Southampton face a daunting trip to Arsenal in their next fixture.\nMan of the match - Neil Etheridge (Cardiff)\nCardiff strike late again - the stats\nSouthampton lost for the first time in six Premier League games (W2 D3).\nCardiff have won consecutive top-flight games for the first time since April 1962.\nSouthampton have kept just one clean sheet in their past 16 Premier League games (0-0 v Chelsea in January).\nCardiff have scored three winners after 90 minutes in the Premier League this season, a joint-high figure along with Wolves.\nSouthampton have both scored (12) and conceded (14) in each of their past eight home league games.\nCardiff have failed to score a first-half goal in a divisional-high 20 Premier League games this season.\nCardiff's opener from Bamba on 69 minutes came courtesy of their first shot on target.\n'We wanted to do it for Emiliano' - what the managers said\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"They shot three times on our goal and scored two goals. We had not many chances but more than Cardiff and scored only once.\n\"If you score an equaliser in added time, you have to take a minimum of one point. It would help us a lot for the mentality, the atmosphere and the feeling for the future.\n\"What we did now was to roll a big stone in our way and to remove that will take a lot of time.\"\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock:\n\"They don't know when they're beaten. It was a deflation to concede so late - everybody thought it was the key to them going and getting the winning goal.\"\n\"I thought we were super after that. I'm really pleased for Ken and Victor [Camarasa] - both the subs helped for the winning goal.\"\n\"We wanted to do it for Emiliano and I'm really proud the lads have done him justice.\"\nWhat's next?\nCardiff host Watford in the Premier League on Friday 22 February (19:45 GMT), while Southampton travel to Arsenal two days later (14:05 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-1 West Ham United: Zaha strike earns deserved point\nRoy Hodgson says his Crystal Palace side should \"not be concerned\" about the sides below them after the Eagles edged up the Premier League table with a draw at home to West Ham.\nWilfried Zaha's deflected equaliser gave Palace a deserved point after an entertaining clash.\nThe point puts Palace into 13th place, four points above the relegation zone.\n\"I'm entitled to have faith in this team,\" said Hodgson, \"I believe that they should be less concerned about the teams below them.\"\nZaha surged into the West Ham area in the 75th minute, and saw his shot from a tight angle hit the boot of Issa Diop before looping into the net to cancel out Mark Noble's first-half penalty.\n\"There are a lot of games to play. I can continue to hope these performances can get us into the top half of the table,\" Hodgson added.\n\"My perception is that I think I've got a very good football team and they showed it today.\"\nThe home side should have been level earlier in the second half, but James McArthur shot against the post despite being free inside the six-yard box.\nAnd Zaha could have put his side ahead just after his leveller, but West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski made an excellent save to his left.\nRelive the day's Premier League action\nRelive the action from Selhurst Park\nThe Ivorian's goal was his third in as many games and came as he returned to the side following his ban for a red card against Southampton in January.\nThe result sees West Ham climb two places into 10th after their second 1-1 draw of the week, while Palace climb one place into 13th to sit three points above the relegation zone.\nPalace earn point the hard way\nThe home side's second-half performance meant that they were good value for a point, but for so long their finishing looked like they would draw yet another blank on home soil.\nThey had scored just eight times at Selhurst Park in the Premier League prior to West Ham's visit, and they were chasing the game after goalkeeper Vicente Guita's clumsy challenge on Michail Antonio gifted the away side the chance to score from the spot.\nMcArthur's miss from close range could scarcely be believed, and when Martin Kelly headed over the bar despite being free in the area another frustrating result for the hosts looked on the cards.\nBut Zaha showed the kind of ruthlessness Palace needed in front of goal, just a few minutes after substitute Michy Batshuayi missed the target despite also finding space in the area.\nWilfried Zaha handed ban and fine for improper conduct at Southampton\nDiop can count himself unlucky that Zaha's shot struck him to deceive Fabianski, but the goal was just reward for Palace who tried 17 shots after the break.\nThe Eagles have gleaned five points from a possible nine of late to edge up the table, but they will need to take their chances if they are to stay away from danger.\nWest Ham's game of two halves\nWest Ham could have put this game out of reach before the break, even before Noble stepped up from the penalty spot.\nRyan Fredericks and Robert Snodgrass both had chances after coming in off either flank, but in each instance Guaita made important saves.\nPalace's Spanish keeper was sent the wrong way by Noble, but another important block to deny Javier Hernandez in the first half proved to be one of the last occasions he had much to worry about.\nWhile the hosts were trying their 17 shots in the second half, West Ham managed none and Manuel Pellegrini looked to shore things up by bringing on Pedro Obiang and Pablo Zabaleta.\nThe Chilean also introduced striker Marko Arnautovic to a mixed reception from his own fans following the recent wrangle over a potential move to China, which ended with a new contract for the Austrian.\nFelipe Anderson was excellent in the first half but faded after the resumption, while the home side's revival was typified by Zaha's tormenting of Fredericks and then Zabaleta right the way to the final whistle.\nIn the final analysis, it was West Ham who looked more grateful to have come away from South London with a draw.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\n'Good, but frustrating' - What the managers said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson speaking to Match of the Day: \"I am frustrated as it was such a good performance. The first half I thought was even, but in the second half it was pretty much one-way traffic.\n\"We had to work hard for our equaliser, we had 17 attempts in the second half, we swarmed around the goal but we found Fabianski in very good form.\n\"We have a group of players who don't put their heads down, they fight for each other and they believe we're a good team, even if our position does not indicate that.\n\"I'm not concerned about what is going on below us, if we keep doing our bit and with performances like today we will get points off our own backs. We know we are good enough to stay out of it.\"\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a good game; in the first 45 minutes we had a brilliant performance and played better than Crystal Palace.\n\"In the second half we made a mistake and dropped inside our own half and allowed them to have to the ball too much.\n\"They were a bit lucky with the goal but they had other chances so the draw was the logical result.\n\"In 95 minutes I think that was the fair result. We have a lot of players missing, we play away so I'm happy with the first 45 and not too happy with the second 45.\"\nNoble on the spot yet again - the stats\n55% of West Ham midfielder Mark Noble's Premier League goals have come from the penalty spot (21/38). Of players with at least 30 goals in the competition, only Leighton Baines (63%) and David Unsworth (58%) have scored a higher proportion from the spot.\nWest Ham are unbeaten in their last eight Premier League meetings with Crystal Palace (W4 D4).\nOnly Southampton (12) and Huddersfield (5) have picked up fewer home points in the Premier League this season than Crystal Palace (13).\nWest Ham didn't manage a single attempt on goal in the second half, while allowing Crystal Palace 17 shots after half-time.\nWilfried Zaha scored his first home goal in 11 games in all competitions for Crystal Palace, since netting against West Brom on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign.\nWilfried Zaha had six shots on goal for Crystal Palace in this game, as many as the entire West Ham team managed.\nWhat's next?\nPalace face a tricky away trip to Doncaster Rovers in the FA Cup on Sunday, 17 February at 16:00 GMT before returning to Premier League action at Leicester City on 23 February at 17:30. West Ham, out of the Cup, don't play until Friday, 22 February when they host Fulham with a 19:45 kick off.\nFollow Palace v West Ham live\nFollow all the Premier League games live"

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-3 Burnley: Chris Wood double helps visitors to vital win\nChris Wood scored twice and goalkeeper Tom Heaton produced a series of outstanding saves as Burnley eased their relegation worries with victory at Brighton.\nThe Clarets are now unbeaten in seven league games and find themselves level on 27 points with the Seagulls - three above the relegation zone.\nWood's five goals in those seven games have been important in his side's new year resurgence, but it has been the displays of 32-year-old Heaton, re-introduced at the start of the run, that have given Sean Dyche's side the platform.\nAt Amex Stadium, he excelled again - twice denying Pascal Gross and making another brilliant block to keep out an effort from Solly March.\nThe opening goal of the match came as a consequence of a slip by Lewis Dunk. Ashley Barnes hooked the ball forward to Wood, who stayed on his feet as the defender fell and finished with a rocket of a shot past Mat Ryan.\nHis second was a strike bent into the bottom-right corner from a Dwight McNeil pass.\nAshley Barnes should have made it 3-0 from open play, but was brought down as he tried to take the ball around Ryan. The keeper was shown yellow and Barnes slotted in against his former club.\nHeaton was finally beaten in the 76th minute when Shane Duffy stooped to head home from Anthony Knockaert's free-kick.\nEarlier, Brighton had two penalty appeals turned down with both McNeil, in the first half, and Jeff Hendrick, after the break, appearing to handle the ball.\nRelive the action from Amex Stadium\nHeaton stars again as Clarets ease worries\nEven by Heaton's recent standards this display was something special.\nHe was the standout performer in January's 0-0 draw against Watford and at Brighton once more underlined why he is now indispensable to the Clarets in their fight to stay in the Premier League.\nFirst to be denied by Heaton was Gross, who saw his superbly executed volley pushed away by the flying keeper. Then came the one-handed save to prevent March from bursting the net before the pick of the match - an acrobatic tip-over from Gross' angled looping effort.\nAnd when the Chester-born keeper was not frustrating the opposition it was his team-mates, with Hendrick doing a sterling job as the 'man on the post' by clearing Gross' goalbound header from a corner.\nHeaton and the Clarets will no doubt be frustrated they have to wait 14 days for their next duel - a match against Tottenham.\nBad luck leaves Brighton in difficult position\nTwo months ago on a similarly wet evening, 10-man Brighton swept aside Crystal Palace 3-1 to sit in 10th spot in the Premier League - back then they were 12 points clear of the Clarets.\nSince then the statistics have been ugly reading for Chris Hughton's side, with one win and seven defeats in 11 games.\nPerhaps they knew it was not going to be their day once again following a first half where nearly everything went against them.\nThere was Dunk's slip to allow Wood a free run on goal alongside Heaton's superhuman feats in goal, and then McNeil's apparent block with the arm of Duffy's acrobatic effort.\nThat incident happened at lightning speed, but perhaps referee Stuart Attwell or one of his officials should have spotted Hendrick's use of the arm to control the ball in the second half.\nFortune finally favoured the home side when Duffy nodded home Knockaert's free-kick 14 minutes from time.\nBrighton can try to find some solace in the FA Cup fifth round when they host Derby next Saturday.\nMan of the match - Tom Heaton (Burnley)\n'I know Heaton's quality' - the reaction\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche speaking to Match of the Day about Heaton: \"I know what a good keeper he is and his alertness made sure we were in good shape. He made saves I'd expect him to save because I know his quality.\"\nOn goalscorers Wood and Barnes: \"We've been brave to play two centre-forwards away from home. I think we've got excellent forwards, and their energy and pride is really helping us. They're scoring goals and we're making it difficult for the teams we're playing against. When you have a front to your team the game has a different feel to it.\"\nOn Hendrick's 'handball': \"We've just had three away games where big decisions have gone against us. If we got a decision going for us today, I know it evens itself out over the season, so I don't make a big deal out of it.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton speaking to Match of the Day: \"We were up against a Burnley team that play a particular way and are in good form at the moment.\n\"They also had a keeper who pulled off three very good saves.\n\"Those pivotal moments in front of goal, you have to take those chances and we haven't been able to do that in the last couple of games.\n\"But we should have had a blatant penalty at 2-0 [Hendrick handball] and Burnley go up the other end and score. The referee or linesman has got to see that.\n\"But we've got to be more clinical in the final third. We put in as many crosses as we have done all season but at the moment it's not going for us.\"\nClarets are only second to Manchester United - the stats\nBrighton have enjoyed just one win in their last 11 Premier League games (D3 L7), after winning five of the eight before that (D1 L2).\nBurnley are unbeaten in their last seven Premier League games (W4 D3), their longest run without defeat in the top-flight since February 1975 (7).\nBrighton have conceded eight penalties in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nBurnley's current run of seven games unbeaten in the Premier League is bettered only by Manchester United (9).\nOnly Liverpool (16) have scored more goals from set-piece situations (excluding penalties) than Brighton this season (12).\nWood has now scored seven league goals against Brighton; against no other side has he netted more (also seven v Huddersfield Town).\nOf players with at least five Premier League goals this season, Wood has scored the highest proportion away from home - 83% (five from six games).\nBarnes has registered four goal involvements in his last three Premier League appearances for Burnley (three goals, one assists), one more than in his previous 16 in the competition (3).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Tottenham on Saturday, 23 February (12:30 GMT) and Brighton are in FA Cup fith-round action against Derby next Saturday (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Leicester City: Spurs maintain title hopes with Wembley win\nTottenham ensured they remain in contention in the Premier League title race as Mauricio Pochettino's side earned victory against Leicester at Wembley.\nSpurs had to weather a late Foxes fightback to remain third in the table after 26 games, but reduced the deficit to leaders Liverpool - who beat Bournemouth on Saturday - to five points.\nChristian Eriksen provided a pin-point cross to set up Davinson Sanchez's first Tottenham goal after 33 minutes, before producing a moment of quality to double the hosts' advantage from the edge of the area in the second half.\nThe Dane's strike came just three minutes after omitted Leicester striker Jamie Vardy emerged from the bench in dramatic fashion to take a penalty on the hour mark - only to be denied by goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.\nVardy made a demonstrable difference to Leicester's attack and converted from Ricardo Pereira's low cross to set up a tense finish, before the in-form Son Heung-min made sure of a home win in stoppage time.\nIt's a fourth consecutive league win for Tottenham who remain in touch with Liverpool and Manchester City at the summit with 12 league games remaining.\nSunday's Premier League action\nTottenham primed to go the distance in title race\n'Under the radar.' 'Doing enough.' 'Finding a way.'\nSuch phrases are quickly becoming synonymous with Tottenham's title bid and, despite the final scoreline, this entertaining battle certainly fit the trend.\nPerhaps understatedly, Mauricio Pochettino described Sunday's meeting with Leicester as \"key\" as the title race hurtles towards its conclusion - trailing Liverpool by eight points, this fixture was firmly in the 'must win' category for Spurs.\nHaving produced several gritty late shows in recent weeks, Spurs appeared second best in the opening half hour but edged ahead - somewhat against the run of play - as Eriksen took his time to judge the smart run of Sanchez into the six-yard box.\nBut Tottenham struggled to shake off their visitors and were left frustrated as Son's penalty claims received a yellow card for simulation under Harry Maguire's tackle.\nThe game was ultimately decided in a period of three second-half minutes, as Lloris denied Vardy from the spot before Eriksen's excellent finish to Schmeichel's right swung the game away from Leicester.\nPochettino's side were once again forced to call upon the resilience that has kept them snapping at the heels of Liverpool and Manchester City, and Wembley breathed a sigh of relief as the lively Son scored for a third consecutive match.\nIt's well documented that Tottenham's charge has come in the absence of key figures - with Harry Kane and Dele Alli now close to returns - and Spurs' current run in the face of such circumstances suggest they are primed to go the distance.\nPochettino unhappy despite victory for \"innocent\" Spurs\nThe Argentine's side may have picked up another crucial three points, but Pochettino was not short of complaints at the full-time whistle as Son became the fourth Spurs player to be booked for diving this season.\nThe 46-year-old described the decision of referee Michael Oliver to book the South Korean for simulation as \"unbelievable\" after he fell to the ground under pressure from Harry Maguire.\n\"I am more relaxed now because we won the game, but so disappointed with the situation because everyone wants to talk about different clubs or players, but do you think we are a team that is trying to cheat the referee?\" said Pochettino.\n\"Come on, we are the most innocent people on the pitch.\n\"Unbelievable, unbelievable, unbelievable. I am a person that always accepts the mistake but I think it was so strange the situation today.\"\nAnd the Tottenham manager once more voiced his objection to the Premier League schedule, as Spurs now face a quick turnaround before facing Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.\nThe Bundesliga leaders played their fixture against Hoffenheim on Saturday.\n\"There are no complaints if Dortmund play today but they played yesterday and today they start to prepare while we play. It upset me a lot,\" added Pochettino.\n\"It's difficult but I am going to show I'm upset to schedule such an important game like this.\"\nVardy call backfires on wasteful Leicester\nThe Foxes have proved difficult customers for 'big six' sides this season - a reputation that was reinforced against Manchester United last weekend despite ultimately falling to defeat.\nHowever, questions over Claude Puel's position - a persistent shadow over Leicester's season - once again surfaced prior to kick-off as the Leicester manager excluded talisman Jamie Vardy from his starting line-up.\nA positive approach from Puel's side caused Tottenham consistent problems, but Vardy's absence was telling as Leicester's bright but wasteful start amplified the 32-year-old's importance to the Foxes.\nHarvey Barnes twice lacked the composure to beat Lloris after racing into the penalty area, while Maguire also fired a powerful header which was tipped over by Lloris.\nThe eventual, dramatic introduction of Leicester's top scorer after Jan Vertonghen was judged to have fouled James Maddison failed to pay-off, and Vardy's miss from the spot was punished by Eriksen's brilliance.\nVardy did make amends with 15 minutes remaining - racing in between Sanchez and Kieran Trippier to halve the deficit - but chasing a deserved point Son delivered a late final blow.\nA positive for Leicester was promising 21-year-old Youri Tielemans, taking his debut following a deadline day loan move from Monaco. The Belgian impressed with an energetic midfield performance that saw him cover more ground than any team-mate.\nBeginning alongside Wilfred Ndidi in the centre of midfield, after Nampalys Mendy was taken ill in the warm-up, he was a source of incisive passes throughout but could not help prevent Leicester extending their winless run to six matches, stretching back to New Year's Day.\n\"We had the feeling we can score, we had a lot of chances and opportunities to get back into the game and it's a big disappointment in the end. We played a good collective performance and it's difficult to accept,\" said Puel.\nOn Vardy, Puel added: \"I told him if you feel you can take the penalty you can take it - it's not a problem.\"\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen (Tottenham)\nNever a dull game - the stats\nTottenham Hotspur against Leicester City has joined the Sheffield derby as the most played top-flight fixture without ever recording a goalless draw (84 meetings).\nTottenham Hotspur have won 20 league games this season - only in their top-flight title winning campaign of 1960-61 have they ever won more after their first 26 matches of a season (22).\nLeicester City are now winless in their last five Premier League matches (D1 L4), their longest run in the division since May last year (also five).\nChristian Eriksen has scored 20 Premier League goals from outside the box - more than any other player since his debut in September 2013.\nLeicester City's Demarai Gray (22 years and 226 days) made his 100th Premier League appearance in this match against Spurs - only Emile Heskey (21 years and 114 days) played his 100th game for the Foxes in the competition at a younger age.\nSpurs have received four bookings for simulation in the Premier League this season, the joint-most in the competition alongside North London rivals Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie on Wednesday (20:00 GMT).\nLeicester welcome Crystal Palace to the King Power Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30 GMT), and Spurs return to league duties against Burnley earlier that day (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 6-0 Chelsea: Sergio Aguero scores hat-trick as City top Premier League\nSergio Aguero was Manchester City's hat-trick hero again as they returned to the top of the Premier League in scintillating style by outclassing Chelsea at Etihad Stadium.\nLiverpool's win against Bournemouth meant Pep Guardiola's side needed victory to return to the summit, albeit having played one game more.\nAnd their job was done after a sensational opening burst brought four goals in the first 25 minutes as Chelsea were left bedraggled, humiliated and on the receiving end of their worst defeat since they lost 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in April 1991.\nThe rout started after four minutes when Chelsea were caught napping by Kevin De Bruyne's quick free-kick which left Raheem Sterling to fire in at the far post before Aguero, who had already missed an open goal, curled a magnificent right-foot finish past the stretching Kepa Arrizabalaga from 25 yards.\nChelsea's embarrassment was symbolised by Ross Barkley's inexplicable header straight to the feet of Aguero to poach his second and Ilkay Gundogan capped that early blitz with a low drive.\nAguero completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after 56 minutes following Cesar Azpilicueta's foul on Sterling, his 15th treble for City and a record-equalling 11th in the Premier League, an honour he shares with Alan Shearer. It was also his second in successive home games after his hat-trick in the 3-1 win against Arsenal.\nSterling then piled on the agony for Chelsea with the sixth, turning in from six yards after David Silva's threaded pass released Oleksandr Zinchenko down the left.\nMan City's perfect response\nIf Liverpool answered questions with their win over Bournemouth, City's response here - and in the last week - has been even more emphatic.\nGuardiola's reigning champions faced a key week after their shock loss at Newcastle United with potentially hazardous home games against Arsenal and Chelsea, and a re-arranged trip to Everton.\nCity made light of any dangers, breezing past Arsenal and overcoming stubborn Everton before wiping out Chelsea with a performance that occasionally touched perfection, especially in the opening phase.\nLiverpool still have a game in hand but City have made up most of that lost ground and this was a resounding message that they will not be handing over the title.\nChelsea, one of the teams to conquer City this season, were dismissed with the minimum of fuss and the momentum City appeared to have lost on Tyneside is back in the most rampant fashion.\nAnd, into the bargain, they have given a huge boost to what may yet be a decisive goal difference equation.\nSarri ball becomes sorry ball\nIf Maurizio Sarri thought his lowest point had come with the second-half capitulation in the 4-0 loss at Bournemouth, the Chelsea boss must now be revising his opinion.\nChelsea may not have regarded themselves as title rivals to City over the whole season but this was a harrowing illustration of the current chasm between the two sides and made for disturbing viewing for the Italian.\nSarri's approach has not carried Chelsea forward in recent weeks and the concern for him will be that owner Roman Abramovich will not like the look of this performance or the margin of defeat - and perhaps more significantly the fact they are now sixth and in danger of not making the top four and Champions League qualification.\nChelsea's performance was characterised by the defensive mess and complete switch off for the opening goal and the hapless Barkley's header straight to Aguero for City's third.\nN'Golo Kante is wasted anywhere other than as arguably the world's finest holding midfielder while Jorginho (who ended up choosing Chelsea rather than City) is a player whose influence decreases by the week.\nEden Hazard was tireless and Gonzalo Higuain was willing to shoot on sight - but they were dreadfully served in a Chelsea performance which was a complete mess.\nA mess that will greatly worry Sarri and Abramovich.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero\n'All I can do is apologise' - What they said...\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"To score six against Chelsea and the way we played, we had so much attention. We did it, it's an incredible compliment to the players, they are outstanding.\n\"We spoke this morning, we trained set pieces, trained some movements and I never thought we would score this amount of goals.\"\nChelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta: \"It is one of the worst nights in my career. It is difficult to explain what happened.\n\"The first five or six minutes went well but that is not enough. We are conceding a lot of goals and we cannot accept that.\n\"All I can do is apologise to the fans because it is not acceptable.\"\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri: \"My feeling this week was really good. It was good during training and the technical meeting and the warm-up. The goal after three minutes made it very difficult to play against these opponents, who played fantastic football.\n\"The motivation today was good. We were not able to stay in the match and react later.\"\nChelsea's unwanted records - Key stats\nSergio Aguero has scored eight Premier League goals for Man City in 2019 - double that of any other player in the competition and more than 11 other Premier League clubs have managed, including Chelsea (seven).\nChelsea conceded four goals in consecutive away top-flight matches for the first time since December 1990.\nOnly Fulham (15) have conceded more Premier League goals during 2019 than Chelsea (13).\nManchester City became the first top-flight team since Tottenham Hotspur in December 1965 to score more than once in 15 consecutive home league matches.\nUp next?\nChelsea travel to Swedish side Malmo in the Europa League on Thursday (20:00 GMT), while Manchester City turn their attention to Newport County in an FA Cup tie next Saturday (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Newcastle United: Willy Boly header denies Newcastle\nWolves defender Willy Boly scored a dramatic late equaliser as Newcastle were denied a precious victory in their battle against relegation from the Premier League.\nRafael Benitez's visitors had appeared on course to move three points clear of the relegation zone courtesy of Isaac Hayden's earlier strike at Molineux.\nBut as the game drifted beyond the minimum four minutes allocated for added time, Boly climbed above Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka to head in Adama Traore's lofted cross.\nNewcastle's players and manager furiously appealed for a foul, with the former Porto defender appearing to have both arms on Dubravka. However, referee Graham Scott waved away their protests.\nBenitez's side went in front when Hayden found the bottom-right corner after collecting a fine pass from Fabian Schar and wrong-footing home goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\nWolves controlled proceedings in the first period and created several chances to score after the break, with Newcastle content to sit back and counter-attack.\nWhen the hosts did break through, Matt Doherty and Raul Jimenez were guilty of close-range misses.\nThe result leaves Newcastle one point above the bottom three in 16th place while Wolves remain seventh.\n'In England they don't understand the rules' - Benitez unhappy with late equaliser\nRelive the action from Molineux\nFinal act denies Newcastle\nWolves may have controlled the tempo but Newcastle's defensive resilience appeared to be paying off.\nWith 10 men often deployed behind the ball, they restricted the hosts to just two shots on target in the first half, laying a platform for them to build on after the break.\nAs they grew in confidence, Matt Ritchie and Schar were afforded the space to launch attacks.\nIt was Schar's purposeful run that created their goal, the Swiss defender feigning to shoot and drawing Boly out of position. That allowed Hayden to receive the ball unmarked and fire home.\nThere were also some neat touches on show by Newcastle's record signing Miguel Almiron, who was introduced for the final 18 minutes.\nYet having resisted intense Wolves pressure in the closing stages, they were undone by the game's final act.\nWith Dubravka caught under a high cross, Boly climbed above him - briefly placing both arms on the Slovak - and bundled the ball over the line.\nMisfiring Wolves\nThis is the second time this term that Wolves have scored late against Newcastle.\nMatt Doherty's 94th-minute goal gave Nuno Espirito Santo's side all three points at St James' Park in December.\nBut despite having 22 shots on goal, this was a misfiring performance in comparison to their last three Premier League outings, which delivered 10 goals and consecutive victories.\nLeading scorer Raul Jimenez, with nine goals this term, was particularly at fault, hitting the target with just one of this six shots.\nDiogo Jota and Doherty also spurned opportunities to score, the latter heading over from three yards out.\nBut Boly's determination at the back post in the dying seconds ensured Wolves' kept up their reputation for late goals.\nNo side has scored more goals after 90 minutes than Wolves this term, who moved level on five with Manchester United and Cardiff.\nMan of the match - Sean Longstaff (Newcastle)\n'We had to be strong enough' - what they said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to BBC Sport: \"It came late, but the performance deserved goals. We created situations but the final touch was not there. It is something we must improve and be more clinical. Credit to Newcastle they were so organised. Last minute shows the character of the team.\nOn whether Boly fouled on the keeper: \"I didn't see the images yet. I will answer this question in the press conference of course. I don't judge the work of the referees because it is so hard. The referees are so well prepared and must decide in a second.\n\"We should have done better, but the effort in the last minute and the way they believed shows character. But we require a lot of improvement.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez to Sky Sports: \"We had to be strong enough defending the cross.\n\"These kind of balls you can do a little bit better, punch the ball. That's it. It was not very clear watching the replay. It is something we have to defend better. We know it is England and people will come to the keeper.\n\"I was not happy with some decisions from the referee, but overall he was fine.\"\nWolves late show again - the stats\nNewcastle have picked up seven points from their last four Premier League games (W2 D1 L1), one more than they managed in their previous nine fixtures in the competition (W1 D3 L5).\nNewcastle's Isaac Hayden netted only his second Premier League goal and his first in 31 appearances, since scoring against Southampton in October 2017.\nOnly Cardiff, Everton and Southampton (all 12) have seen their Premier League games this season goalless at half-time more often than Newcastle (11).\nFabian Schar has been directly involved in three goals in his last four Premier League games for Newcastle (2 goals, 1 assist), as many as he managed in his previous 32 appearances in Europe's big five leagues.\nNewcastle's Miguel Almiron became the eighth Paraguayan to make his debut in the Premier League and the first since West Ham's Fabian Balbuena in August 2018.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Bristol city in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Sunday (13:00 GMT) before resuming Premier League duty at Bournemouth on Saturday, 23 February (15:00).\nNewcastle host Huddersfield in the Premier League on 23 February (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 1-5 Watford: Gerard Deulofeu scores hat-trick in Watford victory\nGerard Deulofeu scored Watford's first top-flight hat-trick since 1986 as they boosted their hopes of a Europa League spot by cruising to victory at Cardiff.\nDeulofeu put the Hornets in front on 18 minutes before two goals in the space of as many second-half minutes ended any hope of a fightback from the hosts, who played a role in their own downfall with some woeful defending.\nThe Spaniard opened the scoring after Bruno Manga gave the ball away, and doubled the advantage after a quick counter-attack. He completed his hat-trick after Harry Arter surrendered the ball tamely.\nDeulofeu then set up Troy Deeney for a tap-in as Watford took a 4-0 lead.\nCardiff arguably could have done better for the visitors' opening three goals, though they were aggrieved at 1-0 that they were not awarded what looked a clear penalty when Daryl Janmaat brought down Josh Murphy.\nThey did manage a consolation when Sol Bamba bundled home, but the four-goal margin was restored when Deeney scored his second from Will Hughes' cross in injury time.\nVictory sends Watford up to seventh while Cardiff remain 17th, though they could return to the relegation zone over the weekend.\nWatford aiming for Europe\nMany felt Watford would be in the lower reaches of the table this season along with Cardiff, but as March approaches they are seventh and through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup.\nThey just about shaded the early exchanges here, though their opening goal was a gift from the hosts.\nCardiff failed to clear not once but three times, with Manga surrendering possession and Sean Morrison and Joe Bennett failing to win back the ball in a scrappy passage of play that culminated with Deulofeu sweeping home a precise, controlled finish.\nAs with the first, Watford's second was as much about Cardiff's poor defending as anything, with the Hornets countering from a set-piece and Deulofeu finishing after outpacing Manga and rounding Neil Etheridge.\nHe repeated the trick shortly afterwards. This time Arter surrendered possession and Deulofeu again had time and space to finish and score Watford's first hat-trick in the top division since Mark Falco.\nThe 24-year old Spaniard capped a brilliant display with an assist for Deeney, who could not miss after a fine team move as he ended a run of eight games without a goal against the Bluebirds.\nAnd Deeney was not done there, sweeping home from Hughes' cross after Bamba had pulled a goal back by firing home from a rebound after his header hit the post.\n\"I am happy with the way we are playing,\" said Hornets manager Javi Gracia. \"We are competing in all the games and with this ambition, I am sure we can achieve something different this season.\n\"We have 40 points now which is good, but we want to keep going in the league and FA Cup.\n\"I am very proud of all my players, they are showing their quality and commitment, the team is getting better and better, but we must try to improve.\"\nCardiff clobbered after emotional week\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock spoke this week about the need to perform in \"12 cup finals\" but their preparation was again overshadowed by the fallout over the transfer of Emiliano Sala.\nSala was Cardiff's record signing but never played for the club - he died when a plane piloted by David Ibbotson, who remains missing, crashed.\nWarnock said the \u00a315m transfer could have been better conducted, but that chairman Mehmet Dalman \"will do things in the right way\".\nCardiff now look to Everton loanee Oumar Niasse as their main goal threat, but he was found wanting just before Watford's opener as he poked the ball straight at Ben Foster after stealing in behind the visitors' defence.\nWinger Murphy also looked lively - firing straight at Foster from a decent position - and thought he should have been awarded a penalty on the stroke of half-time.\nBluebirds boss Warnock could not get over \"the injustice of it\".\nHe told BBC Match of the Day: \"Troy Deeney and all their staff told us it was a stonewall penalty. I had to try and get it out of their minds at half-time.\n\"When everyone from the opponents tell you and deep down I think all the officials knew really. I think the referees guess a lot of the time and you can't do that at this level.\"\nThe Bluebirds were attempting to win three consecutive top-flight league games for the first time since February 1961, but Watford's opening goal appeared to dent their confidence and they never recovered.\nDeulofeu joins the Windass and Henry club - stats\nWarnock has lost his past four home league matches against Watford by an aggregate of 16-2, with this his 16th league defeat against the Hornets. Only against Reading (16) has he lost as many league matches as a manager.\nWatford scored five goals in a top-flight match for the first time since winning 5-1 against Leicester in November 1986.\nDeulofeu has had a hand in seven goals in his past three Premier League appearances against Cardiff (5 goals, 2 assists).\nDeulofeu became only the third player to score a Premier League hat-trick on a Friday, after Dean Windass (Bradford v Derby, April 2000) and Thierry Henry (Arsenal v Liverpool and Leeds in April 2004).\nDeeney's first seven Premier League assists were all for Odion Ighalo - his nine since have been for eight different players (Capoue twice, Kabasele, Niang, Richarlison, Doucoure, Gray, Sema and Deulofeu).\nCardiff have conceded 28 home Premier League goals this season - more than any other side.\nAll four Premier League hat-tricks scored in Wales have been scored by the opposition - Luis Suarez v Cardiff (Liverpool, 2014), Riyad Mahrez v Swansea (Leicester, 2015), Jermain Defoe v Swansea (Sunderland, 2016) and Deulofeu.\nMan of the match - Gerard Deulofeu (Watford)\nWhat's next?\nCardiff City host Everton in the Premier League on Tuesday, 26 February. Watford are at Liverpool the following night."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 3-1 Fulham: Controversial Hernandez goal helps hosts to victory\nJavier Hernandez's controversial goal with his arm contributed to Fulham's 18th Premier League defeat of the season as West Ham fought back from behind to win at London Stadium.\nOn initial viewing, it looked like Hernandez had headed in from a yard to punish goalkeeper Sergio Rico's mistake, but a replay from behind the goal clearly showed the Mexican striker converting via his arm.\nHernandez's equaliser was followed by Issa Diop's towering header five minutes before half-time and Michail Antonio nodded in a third late on.\nThe visitors had started brightly and got off to the perfect start after just three minutes through Ryan Babel's close-range finish - the Dutchman making amends for a glaring miss within the opening 30 seconds.\nLooking to get back into the game in the second period, Fulham skipper Tom Cairney had a low shot smothered by goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, their only real chance of note.\nWest Ham move up to ninth but Claudio Ranieri's side stay in 19th place - eight points adrift of safety - missing a crucial opportunity to claw back the deficit on 17th-placed Cardiff who were thrashed 5-1 by Watford.\nRelive West Ham's win over Fulham\nTime running out for Fulham\nFulham need a remarkable turnaround if they are to avoid dropping straight back into the Championship.\nThe club had high hopes on their return to the top flight after a four-year absence and may well have expected a top-10 finish after becoming the first promoted side to spend \u00a3100m or more in a single transfer window.\nBut the Cottagers have struggled badly and title-winning Ranieri, who replaced Slavisa Jokanovic as manager in November, has failed to shore up a porous defence.\nThe numbers look miserable for Fulham, they have now:\nConceded a league-high 61 goals this season.\nWon just four of their 27 games.\nLost six of their last seven games.\nFailed to win a single game away from home all campaign.\nFormer Liverpool winger Babel finished off a swift team move to open the scoring early on, but that was their only high point, and another fellow ex-Reds winger signed in the January transfer window, Lazar Markovic, was unable to make an impression on his debut from the bench.\nRanieri said: \"We were solid but we didn't have a chance to score again. Time is running out but we never give up, we must be confident and we must dream and continue to fight.\n\"I tell my players if we fight, maybe we can win. If we don't fight, we have lost before we play. It's important to stay together and continue to try our best.\"\nHernandez's helping arm\nWest Ham also invested heavily in the summer, close to \u00a3100m, and move into the top 10 despite an inconsistent season.\nThe Hammers collected just their second win from their last eight games, though their 10 victories this season is equal to their total number of triumphs last term.\nBut the points came courtesy of a huge helping hand from Hernandez, who stooped to put the ball into the net after goalkeeper Rico was unable to clear a corner and both Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna had flicked on.\nReferee Lee Mason was standing at the edge of the box, but his view of the incident was obscured by bodies and an incensed Ranieri gesticulated to his arm on the touchline.\n\"It's an intentional handball, Hernandez knew what he was doing,\" said former West Ham defender Matthew Upson on BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"But Sergio Rico should have done better for the goal. The punch was so poor. You just can't make those mistakes at this level.\"\nFulham never looked like getting back into the game from that point and Diop rose to head in from Robert Snodgrass' corner.\nSubstitute Marko Arnautovic, who had a thumping shot brilliantly tipped onto the bar by Rico, chipped the ball back for Antonio to score the third.\nDeclan Rice has earned rave reviews for his performances this season and playing in his first match since declaring his international availability for England, the midfielder was superb once more.\nNot only did the 20-year-old keep the play ticking for his side but he gave a solid defensive display with six tackles and three interceptions, regaining the ball 13 times - better than any of his team-mates.\nRice told Sky Sports: \"The manager has been on at me all season to protect the back four.\n\"I've been playing so much in midfield now that that's where I want to see my future. I'd love to play in that holding role but there's still much to improve on.\"\nAnother positive for West Ham was the return to action of midfielder Manuel Lanzini, who played the final 14 minutes after being out injured since May because of a knee injury.\nMan of the match - Declan Rice (West Ham)\nIt was handball - Pellegrini\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"We started the game asleep, the first 10 minutes was unbelievable. After that we played a very good game. We scored three goals and had three or four clear chances.\n\"It was a complete game - apart from the first 10 minutes. You never know the reason, maybe we were distracted. The important thing is we changed our attitude.\n\"From my position I couldn't see the handball, I have seen it since and it is handball. Nobody saw it very clearly at the time, there was not too many complaints. I don't think that the goal decided the game.\n\"I never complained when we didn't have results because I don't like excuses but it is very difficult when you have eight or nine injuries but now you can see that we have players coming back.\"\nBabel's long wait for PL goal - the stats\nFulham's nine London derby defeats in a row is the longest such losing run in Football League history by any London side.\nWest Ham have completed the league double over Fulham for the first time since the 2008-09 campaign, when they were managed by Gianfranco Zola.\nWest Ham's victory means the Hammers have picked up 14 points from London derbies in the top flight this season (W4 D2 L2). Only Spurs (15) and Arsenal (16) have managed more.\nFulham boss Claudio Ranieri is now winless in his last 22 Premier League games away from home - the longest run for a manager in the competition since Roy Hodgson back in October 2010 (also 22).\nManuel Pellegrini has now won each of his four Premier League encounters against Fulham, only versus West Brom (6/6) does the Chilean have a better 100% winning ratio in the competition.\nRyan Babel's strike for Fulham was his first Premier League goal since December 2010 (Liverpool v Aston Villa), 3000 days ago.\nWest Ham striker Javier Hernandez has become the first Mexican player to score 50 Premier League goals. All 50 have been scored from inside the box.\nMichail Antonio made his 100th Premier League appearance for West Ham in their match against Fulham. Only Tottenham Hotspur (24) have seen more Englishman play at least 100 games in the competition than the Hammers (21).\nFulham have become just the fourth side in the Premier League era to concede at least 60 goals after 27 matches of a single campaign. Only Barnsley (63 in 1997-98) conceded more than Fulham's 61 so far this season.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham travel to champions Manchester City on Wednesday (20:00 GMT), while Fulham face Southampton at St Mary's on the same day (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Spurs falter on Harry Kane's return\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino angrily confronted referee Mike Dean after a damaging defeat at Burnley dealt a huge blow to his side's Premier League title hopes.\nThe Argentine, who was angered by a number of decisions including the award of a corner that led to Burnley's opener, had to be pulled away by Clarets defender Phil Bardsley as his frustrations spilled over.\nPochettino later said he had \"crossed the line\" and would \"maybe\" apologise to Dean.\nChris Wood broke the deadlock for the hosts early in the second half as he rose to head home Dwight McNeil's inswinging corner - his fourth goal in as many games.\nHarry Kane, making his first appearance since 13 January, equalised after latching on to Danny Rose's quick throw-in and poking past Tom Heaton, before Ashley Barnes tapped in Burnley's winner late on.\nSpurs stay in third place, five points behind Liverpool who face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.\nBurnley rise to 14th and are now six points clear of the relegation places.\nPochettino might apologise to referee Dean\nRelive Burnley's win over Spurs\nKane scores on return as Spurs falter\nTottenham should have been buoyed by the return of Kane, who made his first appearance since picking up an ankle injury in January's defeat to Manchester United.\nBut he struggled to get into the game in a first half that saw him on the end of several hefty challenges by Ben Mee and James Tarkowski. When he did escape their attentions, he fired wide from the edge of the box and saw a header easily saved by Heaton.\nHe improved in the second period, drawing a magnificent save from Heaton who sprang acrobatically to his right to keep out a swerving shot bound for the top corner.\nBut not even the in-form Burnley goalkeeper could deny Kane a goal on his return as he latched on to Rose's throw and poked home to level.\nHowever, with Spurs pouring on the pressure late on the Clarets stood firm, with second-half substitutes Fernando Llorente and Erik Lamela both denied by blocks.\nBattling Burnley's unbeaten run continues\nDespite their excellent form - Burnley are one of only two unbeaten Premier League sides in 2019 - Sean Dyche's men were underdogs coming into this match.\nThat was mainly due to the fact they had taken just two points from their last 42 available at home against the established top six sides.\nBut the Clarets emphatically bucked that trend against Spurs.\nThe hosts were rarely troubled in a first half of few chances, and in the second they more than matched the visitors.\nSuspect Spurs defending helped Wood open the scoring, although replays suggested the corner the goal came from should not have been awarded as the ball appeared to come off Burnley's Jeff Hendrick as he challenged with Jan Vertonghen.\nPochettino's frustration at the decision was emulated by Dyche a short time later when Rose took a throw-in several yards upfield from where the ball went out of play and Kane ran through to tuck home the equaliser.\nAt that point Burnley may have been forgiven for sitting deep and taking a point, but they did anything but.\nAshley Westwood, Barnes and the impressive McNeil were all denied by Hugo Lloris before Barnes scored the decisive goal - tapping in from substitute Johann Berg Gudmundsson's pass.\nThe result means the Clarets have gone eight games without defeat - only Manchester United are on a longer unbeaten run - with any fears of relegation all but dispelled.\nMan of the match - Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\n'A big disappointment' - what they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC MOTD: \"It was a thorough performance and a good win. We know there's a lot of work to be done but they're certainly putting in the work.\n\"We're not a side who can slick it around like Man City but we have very good players. We waned to get in behind them. I thought our front two were outstanding.\"\nBurnley goalscorer Ashley Barnes on Sky Sports: \"I thought we had it then we gave them a sloppy goal from a throw-in. We needed to be alive and we switched off but for us to keep going and get the result was massive.\n\"They are top-quality players so we just had to concentrate on ourselves. We made it hard for them and that was what the gameplan was.\n\"We are getting back to ourselves now. We need to keep being resilient and compact. That's what we did.\"\nTottenham captain Hugo Lloris speaking to Sky Sports: \"Obviously it is a big disappointment. Today was a good opportunity for us and we missed it. It was a tough game. We expected a battle.\n\"We conceded the first goal and it makes things harder. Especially when you concede a corner that didn't exist. It is part of the game.\"\nBurnley on best top-flight run since 1966 - the stats\nBurnley are unbeaten in eight Premier League games (W5 D3), their longest top-flight run without defeat since a run of nine in 1966.\nTottenham suffered only their second defeat in their last eight away games in the Premier League, after losing two of the four before that.\nBurnley have accrued 18 points from their last eight Premier League games (W5 D3), after picking up just 14 from their previous 24.\nBurnley scored their opening goal with their first shot on target of the game on 57 minutes.\nBurnley striker Chris Wood has netted four goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 27 in the competition.\nBurnley forward Ashley Barnes has scored in each of his last four Premier League games (4 goals), after netting in just three of his previous 24 in the competition (4 goals).\nJohann Berg Gudmundsson has registered 15 assists for Burnley in the Premier League, nine more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley will look to continue their good run against Newcastle at St James' Park on Tuesday at 20:00 GMT.

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 2-0 Huddersfield Town: Miguel Almiron impresses on full debut\nRecord Newcastle signing Miguel Almiron's impressive full debut against Huddersfield shows he has \"the right mentality\" to succeed in the Premier League, says manager Rafael Benitez.\nThe Paraguay forward, who arrived for \u00a321m from MLS side Atlanta United, helped Benitez's side ease past 10-man Town and move four points clear of the relegation zone.\nAfter Newcastle missed several chances in the first half, striker Salomon Rondon swept in the opener 59 seconds into the second period.\nAyoze Perez drilled in the second, although Almiron could not add the goal his display deserved.\nHuddersfield, who stay marooned at the bottom of the table, had skipper Tommy Smith sent off after 20 minutes for a high tackle on Almiron.\n\"Everything we have seen is what we were expecting from him,\" Benitez said. \"Obviously, the defenders from the other teams will know him a little bit better now and it will be more difficult for him.\n\"But still, he is someone who is working really hard, so I think he can do well.\n\"Now he has to learn in the Premier League to understand what the physicality of the game means here, but I think he has the right mentality.\"\nNewcastle recorded their third successive Premier League win at St James' Park - for the first time since last April - to move up to 15th.\nUnited boss Benitez's only gripe may be that they should have won by a more convincing margin against a Huddersfield side that managed only one shot on target.\nNewcastle's Kenedy and Sean Longstaff both hit the woodwork in the final half-hour, while Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl produced some superb saves as the home side peppered the away goal with 29 shots.\nTown have lost all four of their matches under new manager Jan Siewert and remain 14 points adrift of safety.\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nAlmiron impresses on home debut\nExcitement and expectation has accompanied Almiron's arrival on Tyneside, with the 25-year-old becoming their most expensive signing since former England striker Michael Owen joined from Real Madrid in 2005.\nThe Paraguayan was handed his full debut by Benitez after coming on as a substitute at Wolves earlier this month - and he did not disappoint the home fans with a sharp performance.\nThe \u00a321m signing, who started on the left of a front three alongside Rondon and Perez, caused problems for the visitors with his pace, while showing enough trickery and awareness to suggest he will have a major impact at St James' Park.\nAlthough he could not cap an impressive performance with a goal, he came mighty close.\nAlmiron hit the post in the 12th minute with a confident chip over Lossl, racing clean through following a nice passing move from the home side.\nTwo other first-half opportunities saw him almost open the scoring - an instinctive left-foot strike stopped low to his right by an alert Lossl and another that squirmed under the keeper before defender Chris Lowe hacked away from his goalline.\nAlmiron also played a key role in another of the game's pivotal moments, forcing a desperate lunge out of right-back Smith that left referee Kevin Friend reaching for the red card.\nIn the second half, he continued to pose problems for Huddersfield and it was unsurprising to see him receive a loud and standing ovation when he was substituted in the 81st minute.\n\"You saw today he can make a massive difference to us, he is a quality player,\" Perez said.\nHave Huddersfield improved under Siewert?\nHuddersfield's time in the Premier League looks set to end in May after a two-season stay, barring an extraordinary - and on this evidence unlikely - turnaround in their form.\nAfter defying the odds to stay up last season, Town's deficiencies - namely scoring goals - have been laid bare this campaign.\nTown appointed 36-year-old Siewert, who like his predecessor David Wagner came from Borussia Dortmund's second team, last month and he started his reign by presiding over defeats to Everton, Chelsea and Arsenal.\nWhile there were some positives to take against sides expected to beat them comfortably, Saturday's trip to a team also in the bottom six before kick-off provided little comfort.\nThis time their inability to cause any problems was created by playing with a numerical disadvantage for over 70 minutes.\nSmith could have few complaints for seeing red, despite protesting his innocence and looking shocked when Friend sent him off, and from that point anything other than a Newcastle win looked unlikely.\n\"The red card broke our neck - before that we had the possibility of possession and chances. It changed the situation of the game,\" Siewert said.\n\"I don't want to complain about anything. I haven't seen the red card again - I have to see it and then make my mind up.\"\nTown have now taken only one point in their past 14 league matches and it looks as though the extent of Siewart's impact in West Yorkshire will not be fully evident until next season - most likely in the Championship.\nMan of the match - Sean Longstaff (Newcastle)\nRondon making his mark at Newcastle - the stats\nNewcastle have recorded a league double over Huddersfield for the first time since 1964-65.\nOnly two sides in Premier League history have picked up fewer points after their first 27 games of a season than Huddersfield this season (11) - Derby in 2007-08 (9) and Sunderland in 2005-06 (10).\nHuddersfield's Jan Siewert is the ninth manager to lose his opening four Premier League matches in charge. The German is the first since Frank de Boer with Crystal Palace at the start of last season.\nNo side has picked up more red cards in the Premier League this season than Huddersfield (4, along with Everton and Leicester).\nSalomon Rondon has been directly involved in 46% of Newcastle's 24 Premier League goals this season (7 goals, 4 assists).\nIn 21 appearances this season, Newcastle striker Rondon has equalled his best haul for goal involvements in a Premier League campaign. He has scored seven goals and provided four assists after scoring nine and making two in 34 games for West Brom in 2015-16.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are back in Premier League action on Tuesday. Newcastle look for a fourth straight home league win when they host Burnley at St James' Park at 20:00 GMT, while Huddersfield aim to end their winless run when they play Wolves at John Smith's Stadium at 19:45."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-1 Wolves: Three penalties in Vitality Stadium draw\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo said referees have a \"difficult task\" after three dubious penalties were awarded - two against his side - in a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth.\nCherries striker Joshua King scored from the spot after going down easily under Joao Moutinho's challenge, and then missed in the second half following a foul - which was outside the box - on Ryan Fraser.\nReferee Roger East was at the centre of the action and turned down a penalty shout from the visitors when defender Chris Mepham misjudged a clearance and the ball bounced off his arm.\nBut he did award Wolves a spot-kick when Adam Smith was judged to have brought down Matt Doherty, with Raul Jimenez coolly converting the equaliser.\nThe official also showed Bournemouth midfielder Jefferson Lerma only a yellow card for an elbow into the face of Moutinho.\nThe point was enough to move Eddie Howe's side up to 10th in the table, six points and two places adrift of Wolves.\n\"Football is not always fair, it was a very competitive and emotional game against a very tough team,\" said Nuno.\n\"Eddie Howe is doing a fantastic job. When incidents happen in the game you cannot lose focus. Until the first penalty we were on top, but then we lost composure and we must improve.\n\"It is a very difficult task for referees. I don't want to talk about VAR [video assistant referee]. As long as the officials are fair nobody can complain.\"\nRelive the incident-packed draw and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\nEast has difficult afternoon\nEast, 53, started badly when he pointed to the spot for Bournemouth's first penalty, despite there appearing to be little contact on King in the box.\nWith uncertainty surrounding the opening goal, East then made further debatable decisions - the most questionable one being to keep Lerma on the field, one of 10 yellow cards handed out in the match.\nThe Colombia midfielder jumped for a high ball with Moutinho, but the Portuguese was left furious about the challenge and needing medical attention with blood inside his mouth.\n\"Joao Moutinho is bleeding heavily from his mouth,\" added Nuno. \"He was not happy at all, and when a short man is angry it's tough.\"\nStriker Jimenez, who had a goal ruled out in the opening period, grabbed a point with seven minutes left after Doherty's coming together with Smith, which East felt warranted a second penalty of the game.\nAnd there was still time for the referee to complete a hat-trick - but King struck his effort wide of the target on this occasion.\nBournemouth manager Howe said: \"My initial reaction to the first one was that it was a penalty.\n\"You're always slightly biased, but I thought theirs was harsh on us. The player got his shot away and you don't see players penalised for the follow-through in that scenario very often.\n\"The third one, there is a debate over whether it is inside the box. I haven't seen it again.\n\"We should score and win. King has been a reliable taker for us - but it wasn't to be.\"\nSolid at the back, lacking up front\nBournemouth were heading towards a third straight clean sheet at home before Jimenez's goal seven minutes from time.\nUp until that point, the Cherries had restricted the visitors to one effort on target - Leander Dendoncker's header which was tipped over the crossbar by Artur Boruc.\nNetherlands centre-back Nathan Ake was at the heart of his side's excellent defensive work, making 14 clearances as well as winning the ball back four times and contributing three tackles.\nOn-loan Liverpool right-back Nathaniel Clyne played well too, but two former Reds could have won the contest.\nDominic Solanke, signed for \u00a319m in January, had a glorious opportunity to make it 2-0 but shot straight at Rui Patricio when through on goal and also flicked a header straight at the keeper, while winger Jordon Ibe smashed an effort against the crossbar.\nWolves battle for point\nThe draw took Wolves to 40 points from 27 matches, which equals their best Premier League tally, set in 2010-11.\nA year later, they finished bottom of the table and only returned to the top flight this term after a six-season absence by winning the Championship.\nSanto's side were far from their best on the south coast but will be pleased to nick something from the game.\nThey have shown their battling qualities throughout the campaign and did so once more, netting their 26th second-half goal of the season.\nSanto added: \"We dig deep in the second half. Both teams could win but the draw says that it was a competitive game and a good spectacle.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to face Arsenal on Wednesday (kick-off 19:45 GMT), while Wolves go to bottom side Huddersfield on Tuesday (19:45).\nThe Norwegian King - the stats\nBournemouth have never lost a Premier League home game against newly promoted opposition (W7 D3).\nThis was the first Premier League game to have three penalties since West Ham v Watford in April 2016.\nWolves have scored 74% of their league goals in the second half of games this season (26 of 35), a league-high ratio.\nWolves have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their past nine away league matches.\nRaul Jimenez (10 goals, five assists) has had a hand in a higher share of Wolves' 35 league goals this season than any other player (42.9%).\nBournemouth's Joshua King is now the third-highest-scoring Norwegian in the Premier League (39 goals), with only Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (91) and Steffen Iversen (40) netting more.\nKing is only the second Cherries player to score in three top-flight home games in a row, after Junior Stanislas in October 2018.\nBournemouth's Adam Smith was shown a yellow card after 49 seconds, the second-quickest card awarded in the Premier League this term."

        "article_text": "Leicester 1-4 Crystal Palace: 'It is normal for fans to be worried' says Puel\nLeicester boss Claude Puel said \"it is normal for the fans to be worried\" after his side suffered a 4-1 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Premier League.\nIt was the first time in 19 years Leicester have lost four league games in a row at the King Power.\nThey have also gone six games without a win and have conceded the first goal in 19 matches, more than any other team.\n\"I understand the fans' feelings, they are disappointed,\" said Puel. \"It is a difficult period for my team.\"\n\"I would like the fans to keep their support for the players, to support all these young players in the next game. At this moment we are unlucky. They have the feeling that they are not getting fair results.\n\"When we look at just the results it is not enough, it is not normal. But when we look at the performances it is crazy in this period. It is difficult to accept.\n\"I manage the pressure, the most important thing is my players,\" he added.\nWilfried Zaha scored twice as Crystal Palace eased their relegation worries on a day when Roy Hodgson became the oldest man to manage in the Premier League at 71 years and 198 days.\nIn a first half of few chances, the Eagles broke the deadlock when Michy Batshuayi fortuitously deflected James McArthur's effort past Kasper Schmeichel.\nJonny Evans fired home Harvey Barnes' low cross to equalise midway through the second half before Zaha ghosted in at the back post to retake the lead for the visitors.\nLuka Milivojevic then scored from the spot after Evans clumsily brought down Jeffrey Schlupp and Zaha added a fourth in injury time to make the points safe for Hodgson's side.\nEagles take their chances\nWhile Leicester took 14 shots in the first half alone, Palace only needed seven to score their four goals.\nIt is the ruthless streak the Eagles had been missing so far this campaign, and the sort of efficient finishing that perhaps could have seen them pull away from the drop zone weeks ago.\nHowever, having now put together a four-game unbeaten run for the first time in the Premier League this season, any relegation worries have been well and truly eased.\nBatshuayi opened the scoring with just their third shot on goal, as he instinctively powered home McArthur's volleyed effort.\nZaha added another after Evans had handed the hosts a lifeline as he calmly volleyed past Schmeichel before Milivojevic dispatched from the spot.\nZaha then netted their fourth - finishing off a lightning counter which epitomised Palace's performance - deep into injury time with the tiring Leicester defenders and a frustrated Schmeichel already well beaten.\nIt will be a game Hodgson and the Eagles faithful will cherish.\nLacklustre Leicester struggle again\nGiven Leicester have now conceded the opening goal a league-high 19 times, history suggests the Foxes are often slow starters.\nBut against the Eagles they began the game in encouraging fashion, dominating both possession and territory.\nJames Maddison, Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes all tried their luck from range as the Foxes racked up 27 shots on goal, but none of their efforts seriously tested Vincente Guaita.\nJamie Vardy went close when he headed Barnes' wicked cross over the bar while Mamadou Sakho did well to block a vicious strike from Maddison.\nBut for all Leicester's efforts it was Palace who struck first - with only their third shot of the game.\nThe hosts continued to press following the break and they did eventually get their reward as Evans blasted home the impressive Barnes' low cross after 63 minutes.\nBut they had no answer to Zaha's first and they crumbled when Milivojevic added a third.\nDefeat means the Foxes have equalled a club Premier League record of four straight home defeats with pressure mounting on Claude Puel.\nMan of the match - Luka Milivojevic (Crystal Palace)\n'We put away our chances' - what they said\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson on BT Sport: \"It was a very important victory for us. We dug in extremely well and didn't concede many clear-cut chances.\n\"I was really pleased with the way we established control in the second half and we put away our chances. You do need to maximise the chances that come your way.\"\nEagles goalscorer Wilfried Zaha, speaking to BT Sport: \"It is a massive result. Obviously we're trying to keep the run going and we came here and did what we had to do.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel on BT Sport: \"I think we made a good performance in the first half with good chances and good play, and then conceded the first goal with their first shot.\n\"It was difficult to find a solution because they played and blocked but we tried a lot of good moves.\n\"We came back with desire in the second half but after the second goal we did not manage the game right. It was difficult to have structure and stop the counter attack.\"\nBatshuayi's big five - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won four Premier League away games against Leicester; against no other side have they won more (also four v Everton).\nCrystal Palace striker Michy Batshuayi scored in the Premier League for the first time since October 2017 (for Chelsea v Watford), 490 days ago.\nSince the start of the 2014-15 season, no player has scored for more different clubs than Crystal Palace's Michy Batshuayi in the big five European leagues (5 - Marseille, Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund, Valencia and Crystal Palace).\nLeicester goalscorer Jonny Evans became the fourth Northern Irish player to make 250 appearances in the Premier League (also Aaron Hughes, Chris Brunt and Steven Davis).\nCrystal Palace midfielder James McArthur assisted two goals in a Premier League game for the first timer ever (232 appearances).\nCrystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha has scored in three consecutive league appearances for the first time ever.\nSince his debut in February 2017, Luka Milivojevic has scored 20 goals for Crystal Palace; more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester welcome Brighton to the King Power Stadium on Tuesday (26 February, 19:45 GMT). Meanwhile, Crystal Palace host Manchester United the following night (27 February, 20:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool held to goalless draw by injury-hit Man United\nLiverpool got the point they needed to return to the top of the Premier League but were left frustrated by their failure to break down a Manchester United side that was ravaged by injuries.\nA draw at the home of their fiercest rivals would usually be seen as mission accomplished for Jurgen Klopp's side, but this has to go down as something of a wasted opportunity to get some daylight over nearest rivals Manchester City.\nInjuries to three midfielders meant United were forced to use all of their substitutes in a bizarre 25-minute period before half-time with one of them, Jesse Lingard, quickly being replaced himself.\nLiverpool did not escape unscathed, with Roberto Firmino only lasting until the half-hour mark, and without him his side struggled to pose any sort of threat in front of goal in what was was a typically intense encounter.\nThe constant disruptions made for a disjointed first half and neither side could truly find their rhythm after the break - although the lack of quality did not affect the raucous atmosphere throughout.\nKlopp's side failed to truly test United keeper David de Gea, with a shot from distance by Firmino's replacement Daniel Sturridge their only shot on target in the 90 minutes.\nUnited had the best chance of the game, but Alisson brilliantly denied Lingard after he ran on to Romelu Lukaku's pass and attempted to go around the Reds keeper.\nThe hosts thought they had stolen victory near the end when Liverpool defender Joel Matip put through his own net from a free-kick, but Chris Smalling was adjudged offside in the build-up.\nWith Manchester City in action in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday, the result means Liverpool move a point ahead of them with 11 games to go.\nUnited drop to fifth place, with Arsenal leap-frogging them with their win over Southampton.\nInjuries spoil Solkjaer's plans\nUnited do not factor in this season's title race but this was still an important game for interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's ambitions to become their manager on a permanent basis.\nThis was his chance to show that the tactical nous that has brought him success on the road at Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea could bring him his biggest result so far at Old Trafford.\nSadly for Solskjaer, those plans were scuppered by injuries, much as they were in United's Champions League defeat here by Paris St-Germain when he lost Anthony Martial and Lingard by the midway point of the game.\nThis time he was without Nemanja Matic from the start, with the Serbian injured in training on Saturday morning.\nMatic's replacement, Scott McTominay, was making his first league start since Solskjaer took charge in December and ended up being one of the outstanding players of United's makeshift midfield.\nFirst Ander Herrera was forced off, to be replaced by Andreas Pereira after 21 minutes, with Juan Mata limping off four minutes later after he was hurt in a crucial challenge with Mohamed Salah.\nMata was replaced by Lingard, returning to action for the first time since that PSG defeat, and he looked set to make a decisive impact before being denied by the brilliance of Alisson, who got down smartly to nick the ball off his feet.\nInstead, Lingard appeared to tweak a hamstring as he stumbled beyond Alisson and was himself replaced by Alexis Sanchez before half-time.\nUnderstandably, those changes left United lacking spark in attack - especially because Marcus Rashford played on despite also appearing to pick up an injury early on.\nAt the other end, however, United yielded nothing, and Solskjaer deserves nothing but credit for the way he reorganised his side.\nLiverpool's attack a concern for Klopp\nLiverpool's travelling fans were kept in their seats until long after the final whistle and used their time to noisily and repeatedly salute their side's return to the summit.\nThis was a result the majority would surely have accepted before kick-off, but the manner they earned their draw as they used up their game in hand over City was far from convincing.\nThere was a spell in the first half when Liverpool were winning the ball back in dangerous areas and putting pressure on United but, even then, their lack of cutting edge was apparent.\nWhen Firmino was on on the pitch, Salah and Sadio Mane struggled to impose themselves on the home side's defence and, when the Brazilian departed, the rest of Liverpool's front-line all but disappeared too.\nWith United sitting back in the second half, Liverpool had much more of the ball but, just as they did against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, Klopp's side struggled to do very much with it.\nTheir inability to open up opposition teams when they defend in numbers must be a concern for Klopp, because they are sure to meet more sides who will do the same in the next few weeks.\n400th day at the top - the best of the stats\nThis draw has taken Liverpool top of the Premier League, meaning today will be the 400th day they have finished top of the table in the competition's history.\nLiverpool have played out back-to-back goalless draws in all competitions for the first time since April 2013 (v West Ham and Reading) under manager Brendan Rodgers.\nManchester United have failed to score in back-to-back games at Old Trafford in all competitions for the first time since December 2015 against PSV Eindhoven and West Ham United with Louis van Gaal in charge.\nLiverpool have managed to win just two of their last 18 visits to Old Trafford in all competitions (D3 L13), and only one of their last 13 (D3 L9).\nLingard became the first player to be substituted on and then off in the first half of a Premier League match since Kevin Long for Burnley against Newcastle United in January 2015.\nManchester United were the first team to make all three substitutions in the first half of a Premier League game since Burnley in January 2015 vs Newcastle United.\nThere were four substitutions made in the first half of this match - the most in a single Premier League game since Wigan v Fulham in February 2009 (also four).\nThis was the fifth draw played out by Manchester United and Liverpool in their last seven meetings in all competitions (one win each), as many as their previous 50 encounters combined beforehand.\n'We didn't do well' - Klopp\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC MOTD: \"Everything that could have gone wrong in the first half went wrong. We had four injuries - we had to keep Marcus Rashford on - it seemed like it was going to be a tough afternoon.\n\"I can't remember Liverpool having a chance. Even though they had possession, I can't remember David de Gea making a save. Scott McTominay was excellent. When they need a goal and they take Mohamed Salah off you know Luke Shaw has played a good game.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We might feel like we won a point or lost two. We started exactly how we wanted to start. The injury crisis then started.\n\"We were without chances - only United had one big one when Alisson made an excellent save - the rest were set-pieces. It kept the game open but we didn't create enough and that's the truth. We didn't do well to be honest. We take that. It is a point gained because we have one more than before but it doesn't feel like that.\n\"The boys didn't feel okay. I could see it in their faces. It was strange. I was thinking 'what is gong on here today'. They lost momentum and rhythm and couldn't really get it back.\"\nMan of the match - Scott McTominay (Manchester United)\nWhat next?\nLiverpool are back at Anfield on Wednesday when they play Watford (20:00 GMT) then travel across Stanley Park to face neighbours Everton on Sunday (16:15 GMT). Manchester United travel to Crystal Palace on Wednesday (20:00), then host Southampton on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-0 Southampton: Dominant Gunners move back into top four\nArsenal punished struggling Southampton with two first-half goals to move back into the top four of the Premier League.\nThe Gunners led when Alexandre Lacazette reacted quickest to turn in Henrikh Mkhitaryan's shot, with the Saints' claims for offside proving futile.\nAnd they doubled their lead shortly after when Mkhitaryan drilled a shot into the bottom corner.\nArsenal should have scored more in a dominant first half, but ultimately it mattered little as those goals were enough to move Unai Emery's side above Manchester United, who drew at home to Liverpool.\nSaints, who missed good chances through Nathan Redmond and Matt Targett before each of Arsenal's goals, offered more resistance after the break.\nBut they remain in the bottom three, a point adrift of fourth-bottom Cardiff, after failing to win for a fourth successive league game.\nFollow all the reaction from Sunday's Premier League games\nDo Arsenal need to be more ruthless to secure top-four finish?\nArsenal have struggled for consistency under Emery in the second half of the season, alternating between wins and defeats in each of their 10 previous matches before Southampton's visit.\nIn truth, anything other than a home win against the Saints looked unlikely. However, Emery may be concerned with his side's inability to demolish their lowly opponents.\nThe Gunners looked potent every time they burst forward, particularly in the first half, and in the closing stages, against a Southampton side which looked fragile at the back.\nLacazette was allowed the space to turn in the opener, with the visitors' defence unorganised and too concerned about appealing for offside, for his 13th goal of the season.\nAfter Mkhitaryan doubled the lead, the France striker should have added another but somehow scooped over the bar from a few yards out.\nArsenal's dominance was illustrated by the 11 shots which they attempted in the first half, nine of which came from inside the Saints area.\nAfter the break they failed to assert themselves in a similar fashion, until Pierre-Emerick's Aubameyang's introduction as a late substitute stretched the visitors again.\nThe Gabon striker was unable to add to his 18 goals for the season, tamely side-footing at Saints keeper Angus Gunn from close range and seeing another effort blocked by Jannik Vestergaard's sliding challenge.\nUltimately, they still had enough to see off Southampton, but are likely to need to be sharper in the final third if they are to stay ahead of United and Chelsea to secure a return to the Champions League next season.\nThat is also particularly pertinent as, despite keeping a rare clean sheet, they still needed keeper Bernd Leno to be alert to prevent Southampton finding a foothold in the game.\nDefensive errors cost Saints\nSaints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl announced his arrival in the Premier League when his new side caused an upset by ending the Gunners' 22-match unbeaten run in December's reverse fixture.\nBut momentum has stalled under the Austrian in recent weeks, with Saints' inability to take victory against Crystal Palace, Burnley or Cardiff City proving particularly damning.\nThose three fixtures - which included home games against Palace and Cardiff - had been earmarked by Saints fans as ones where they needed to accumulate points to help their bid in avoiding the drop.\nYet only two points from that run proved disappointing and heaped on more pressure for the trip to the Emirates.\nHasenhuttl decided to play Redmond in a lone striking role and that almost paid dividends early on when the former England Under-21 international used his pace to race clear of the Arsenal defence.\nHowever, Redmond could not beat Leno - who stood up to block with his chest - and Arsenal punished them through Lacazette a matter of seconds later.\nIt was a similar story with the Gunners' second goal, Targett seeing a low angled drive pushed clear by Leno before the home side doubled their lead through Mkhitaryan shortly after.\nBoth goals were preventable - with a couple of defenders reacting too slowly for the first and a miscued backpass from Jack Stephens punished for the second.\nHasenhuttl reacted by introducing two strikers at the break - Charlie Austin and Michael Obafemi - and taking off Stephens, changing shape to shore up the visitors defensively.\nSaints offered more attacking threat, with James Ward-Prowse and Austin going close, but ultimately they could not find a breakthough to worry Arsenal.\nNow they turn their attention to Wednesday's crunch relegation battle against second-bottom Fulham - where defeat will leave either side even deeper in trouble.\n'The good thing is we didn't collapse' - post-match reaction\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"I think we deserved to win. We got the chances, we played very well and I think we can do more [to make a] difference to the result in the final 20 minutes of the first half.\n\"The second half was maybe an under-performance from the first, but I think also we deserved another goal.\n\"It's difficult to keep the intensity for 90 minutes, in the second half we continued with finding attacking moments and creating chances. The most important is the three points at home with our supporters.\n\"We are thinking it's a good step and it's game by game. Now we are happy, we are at the moment in this position and we carry on.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"The key moment was the chance for 1-0 and then they [Arsenal] were up. They were much better and played very simple and we had problems to defend, which is why we switched and changed the shape.\n\"We had a few chances but Arsenal also did too. If you are 2-0 here then its easy for Arsenal. The good thing is we didn't collapse today. We didn't, but we deserved to lose today.\n\"For us every game is big. The next weeks are very tough for us and against Fulham we need to have a win and recover very well now for Wednesday and do everything to win this game.\"\nMan of the match - Granit Xhaka (Arsenal)\nWhy Saints must hate going to Arsenal - the stats\nArsenal are unbeaten in their last 24 home league games against Southampton - winning 18 and drawing six - since a 1-0 loss in November 1987.\nSouthampton have not won any of their 20 away Premier League games against Arsenal, drawing five and losing 15 - the most a team has played away at another without ever winning in the competition.\nSince losing 2-0 against Manchester City on the opening weekend, Arsenal have remained unbeaten in 13 Premier League home games (W11 D2), winning the last seven in a row.\nSouthampton have lost seven of their last nine Premier League trips to London and are winless in the last four.\nAlexandre Lacazette has scored against 18 of the 22 Premier League teams he has faced with Arsenal.\nLacazette is the first Arsenal player to score in four consecutive Premier League games since Robin van Persie in March 2012 (five games).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in Premier League action at 19:45 GMT on Wednesday.\nArsenal host 10th-placed Bournemouth as they aim to earn an eighth-straight home win in the Premier League.\nSaints, meanwhile, face second-bottom Fulham in a crunch relegation battle."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield 1-0 Wolves: Jan Siewert gets first win with late goal\nManager Jan Siewert said Huddersfield \"still have a chance\" of Premier League survival after they beat Wolves to end a 14-game winless run and give the German his first victory as Terriers manager.\nSteve Mounie scored the winner in the 91st minute as he turned in the rebound from inside the six-yard box after Karlan Grant's shot.\nThe win sparked wild celebrations with the striker mobbed by his team-mates after scoring, while Siewert was swamped by his backroom staff and the players linked arms to celebrate in front of their fans.\nHuddersfield remain bottom of the table, still 11 points from safety but have their first win since 25 November and their first in five games under Siewert.\n\"Since the time I arrived, I said we still have a chance and we believe that,\" the German said.\n\"There are still games to go. We will keep on fighting.\n\"My thoughts are just with the boys. They made me so proud. They deserve it so much.\n\"I think we can all be proud to be Huddersfield this evening.\"\nTown deserved the three points but it had looked like another lacklustre showing in front of goal would cost the Terriers with Mounie putting a header into the side-netting from close range earlier in the second half.\nHe also shot narrowly wide of the post late on while Jonathan Hogg and Jon Gorenc Stankovic could have done better with headers after half-time.\nWoeful Wolves missed the chance to move into seventh in the table and saw their eight-game unbeaten run come to an end.\nTheir only real chances came in the first half when Raul Jimenez glanced a header off target and Matt Doherty scuffed a shot wide of the near post.\nHuge celebrations for rare win\nHuddersfield's bleak situation at the bottom of the table means this win will still likely be in vain in terms of their Premier League survival but the emotional scenes showed how much the three points meant to Siewert, the players and the fans.\nSiewert's previous four games in charge ended in defeats to Everton, Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle and, after the latter, the German heavily criticised his players, calling for more fight.\nHe made eight changes to play Wolves, including recalling Mounie and handing fellow forward Karlan Grant a first start for the club, and the players responded.\nHuddersfield started with high intensity, preventing Wolves gaining an early foothold in the game, and, in the second half, the hosts dominated, creating the only real chances.\nThe only part of their performance that was lacking was Huddersfield's finishing in front of goal, a familiar theme this season for the league's lowest scorers under both Siewert and previous manager David Wagner.\nMounie had been as guilty as any of his team-mates but when the ball fell to him while he was on the floor in the six-yard box, he managed to complete the finish.\nIt remains to be seen whether the three points can spark a push for survival with 10 games remaining.\n\"I told you right from the beginning. I know it won't be easy but we keep on fighting,\" Siewert said.\n\"You can calculate the number of games. There is still a chance. It would be good. I would enjoy that.\"\nThe 36-year-old also said he had never doubted whether he had made the right decision in joining Huddersfield from Borussia Dortmund's second team last month.\n\"I never thought that,\" he said.\n\"I know my players. I have really enjoyed working with them.\n\"It is more how do I get them in lucky moments. Today we found some solutions and I am so proud.\"\nWolves a real disappointment\nA point for Wolves would have seen Nuno Espirito Santo side's achieve their highest points total in a Premier League season.\nThey will still reach that milestone in the remaining games but their performance at the John Smith's Stadium must rank as one of their worst since returning to the top-flight last summer.\nThey failed to have a shot on target and played little of their slick, attacking football.\nTheir unbeaten run has been impressive but this defeat follows back-to-back draws in the league.\nNuno said afterwards that his team must \"bounce back\" to ensure there is no repeat performance at the weekend.\n\"It was a tough game and it wasn't one of the best performances we had but credit to Huddersfield for fighting for each ball,\" he said.\n\"We came from a good run but we have to bounce back. We are very cautious that what happened today cannot happen again.\"\nMan of the match - Karlan Grant (Huddersfield)\nWolves' Huddersfield woe - the best stats\n79% (11/14) of the Premier League points won by Huddersfield this season have come against newly-promoted teams - six vs Wolves, three vs Fulham and two vs Cardiff.\nWolves have lost eight of their last nine away league matches against Huddersfield.\nSix of Huddersfield's last nine Premier League wins have come against teams beginning with W - two apiece against Watford, West Brom and Wolves.\nAll five of Huddersfield's clean sheets in the Premier League this season have been against newly-promoted teams - two vs Cardiff and Wolves and one vs Fulham.\nHuddersfield Town are one of four sides that Nuno Espirito Santo has faced more than once as Wolves boss in all competitions without winning, along with Man City, Sunderland and Swansea City.\nWolves named an unchanged starting XI for the 12th time in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nWolves have lost seven of their 12 Premier League matches against teams starting the day bottom.\nSteve Mounie scored just his second Premier League goal of the season for Huddersfield, with both of his goals coming at the John Smith's Stadium.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides' next games are at 15:00 GMT on Saturday.

Some of the lads are saying Bobby Reid was fouled before the first goal, but I couldn't see us scoring tonight and we have to get on with it.\n\"We will probably be in the bottom three when we go to Wolves on Saturday and people will be writing us off. I know my team for the Wolves game and I want people who will be in the trenches because I was let down by one or two tonight. I'm not going to throw the towel in and I'll make sure we are ready for Saturday.\"\nEverton manager Marco Silva: \"We are happy with the win. We played with more freedom after the goal and you can see the type of football we can play. We were in command of the match.\"\nOn their 17 days between matches: \"We had time to prepare which was important and we could work on what we wanted to. The most important thing for us is winning points to boost our confidence and now we have to rest and recover.\n\"We have a big test on Sunday and I know how important it is for the fans and our opponents. We know how we lost the first game at Anfield and we can achieve victory at our own ground.\"\nCardiff suffer midweek blues - the stats\nCardiff have won just one of their last six home league games (D1 L4), after winning four of the five before that (L1).\nEverton have done the league double over Cardiff for the first time since 1928-29.\nCardiff have never won a midweek Premier League game (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), drawing three and losing seven. They've scored just two goals in those 10 games and have conceded at least twice in each defeat.\nCardiff are the only side to fail to direct a single shot on target in more than one home Premier League game this season, doing so against Everton and against Huddersfield in January.\nEverton scored with their first two shots on target and with three of their four shots on target overall in the game.\nEverton's Gylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in more Premier League goals in games played in Wales than any other player (35 - 14 goals, 21 assists in 68 appearances).\nSigurdsson is now the Premier League's outright top-scoring Icelandic player with 57 goals, eclipsing Eidur Gudjohnsen's haul of 55.\nSigurdsson has scored 15 Premier League goals for Everton since the start of the 2017-18 season, five more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nCardiff visit Wolves on Saturday, 2 March (15:00 GMT), while Everton host Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Sunday, 3 March (16:15)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-1 Brighton & Hove Albion: Brendan Rodgers watches new side win\nNew Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers \"promised the players there are special things on the horizon\" after watching their win over Brighton, said caretaker boss Mike Stowell.\nRodgers was confirmed as boss an hour before kick-off and sat in the stands as Stowell and Adam Sadler took temporary charge after the sacking of Claude Puel on Sunday.\nDemarai Gray opened the scoring as he ran on to Youri Tielemans' pass to smash home.\nGlenn Murray missed a glorious chance to equalise, when he blazed the ball over from six yards out.\nJamie Vardy doubled Leicester's lead from James Maddison's pass, but Davy Propper gave struggling Brighton hope three minutes later with a crisp low drive.\nThe Seagulls, who have yet to win a Premier League game in 2019, could not find an equaliser and remain three points above the relegation zone.\nLeicester had been in similarly poor form, having failed to win Puel's final seven games.\nFirst-team coach Stowell said: \"Brendan's pleased. He spoke to the lads in the dressing room. He was proud of them and liked the spirit.\n\"The atmosphere has lifted with a win and with the new manager because I'm sure he'll bring a lot of good things. It's exciting times.\n\"He's got a presentation to give to them on Thursday on what he expects from them on and off the pitch. I'm excited about watching that.\"\nRodgers' route to Premier League redemption?\n'Sentiment trumped by ambition' - why Rodgers' Celtic exit is no surprise\nReaction to all of Tuesday's Premier League games\nSigns of encouragement for Rodgers\nPuel was sacked on Sunday after a 4-1 defeat by Crystal Palace, a sixth loss in seven games. Leicester players were reported not to be happy with the Frenchman's methods, while many Foxes fans never really warmed to him.\nBut they instantly seem to have taken to Rodgers - who has led Celtic to consecutive Scottish trebles and guided Liverpool to the brink of the 2013-14 Premier League title.\nThe Northern Irishman, who takes charge for the first time at Watford on Sunday, received a standing ovation from the fans when he was introduced before kick-off.\nAs a manager who plays an attractive brand of football and gives youth a chance, he will like what he saw going forward.\nHarvey Barnes was excellent on the left wing, causing Brighton problems throughout, with Tielemans pulling the strings in midfield and Gray on the scoresheet. Maddison looked back to his playmaking best after a reduced impact in recent weeks, while Ben Chilwell offered attacking options from left-back. All those players are 22 or younger.\nThe opening goal involved three of them as Barnes won the ball on the halfway line before finding Tielemans, whose perfectly weighted pass was finished by Gray, who timed his run well.\nGray almost added a second moments later was but denied by a good low Mat Ryan save.\nThe second goal saw Gray and Maddison link up before Vardy ran through to finish for his second goal in three games.\nThey conceded soon after, but showed good defensive resolve to see the game through and pick up their first home win since beating Manchester City on 26 December.\nMixed performance for Brighton\nBrighton played really well in parts, but their worrying slide continues. The last time they won in the Premier League, on 29 December against Everton, they were 11 points clear of the bottom three and looked in no danger.\nBut their only three wins since then have all been in the FA Cup on their run to the quarter-finals. Two points from their past seven games have left them in real relegation trouble.\nThey created plenty of chances at Leicester, with 15 shots in total, and Murray was guilty of their two worst misses.\nThe 35-year-old, who has scored 106 goals in two spells for Brighton, hopelessly fired over after Pascal Gross' backheel had picked him out in space. The playmaker injured himself in picking out Murray and had to be replaced.\nMurray replaced his boots immediately after missing that chance but his new footwear also let him down two minutes from the end as he slammed a volley into the side-netting.\nAnthony Knockaert forced a good save from Kasper Schmeichel in the first half while most of their other chances came from corners, with Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk missing several opportunities each.\nThey did not defend poorly, with both of Leicester's goals coming from pacy forwards chasing through-balls, but Chris Hughton knows his team need to start taking their chances and conceding fewer goals if they do not want to drop back into the Championship.\n\"It's only us who can turn things around,\" said Hughton. \"We can't keep speaking about character after every game, we need to make sure we get results. It doesn't matter how the results come. Sometimes you need a bit of fortune, resilience and grit.\n\"We weren't going to go through the season without having a difficult period and it's still in our hands. We have a good opportunity at home to Huddersfield on Saturday to start picking up points.\"\nMan of the match - Harvey Barnes (Leicester)\nMatch stats - Gray's best Premier League season\nBrighton (P7 D2 L5) are the only side in the top four tiers of English Football still to win a league game in 2019.\nLeicester are unbeaten in 15 home matches played on Tuesday (W11 D4) since losing 4-2 to Chelsea in the League Cup third round in September 2016.\nBrighton have conceded two or more goals in five consecutive away league games - the Seagulls last went on a longer such run between December 2005 and February 2006 whilst in the Championship (seven games).\nLeicester are unbeaten in their past 33 Premier League games at the King Power Stadium in which they have scored the opening goal (W29 D4), since a 5-2 defeat against Arsenal in September 2015.\nMaddison is the first English midfielder to be involved in 10 goals in the Premier League this season (five goals, five assists).\nDemarai Gray's opener after nine minutes and 22 seconds was Leicester's fastest league goal of this campaign - he has now scored four goals in the 2018-19 Premier League, his best return in a league campaign since six in the 2014-15 Championship season with Birmingham.\nJamie Vardy has scored in his past three Premier League appearances for Leicester against Brighton.\nWhat's next?\nRodgers takes Leicester to Watford, his first managerial club, on Sunday (12:00 GMT). Brighton are at home to bottom side Huddersfield Town on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 2-0 Fulham: Saints move out of relegation zone\nSouthampton moved out of the Premier League relegation zone and left Fulham 10 points from safety with a comfortable win at St Mary's.\nRalph Hasenhuttl's side saw just 36% of the ball in the opening 45 minutes but led 2-0 thanks to Oriol Romeu's finish after a poor Sergio Rico punch and James Ward-Prowse's follow-up when Nathan Redmond's shot was saved.\nFulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic fired over the bar from a narrow angle with the score at 1-0 and he again lifted over when put through on goal a minute after the interval.\nRyan Babel shot onto the bar via a deflection for Claudio Ranieri's side but they failed to muster a meaningful rally and the Italian manager's substitution of Tom Cairney drew boos from away supporters.\nFulham are 19th, 10 points adrift of Saints in 17th.\n'Should-win' becomes easy win\nHasenhuttl branded the fixture \"must-win\" for Fulham and \"should-win\" for his own side.\nDespite being winless in four and having just six home wins in 37 fixtures at St Mary's coming into the fixture, Saints looked confident and energised.\nRyan Bertrand was a regular threat and it was his super delivery which won the corner that led to the opener, Romeu firing a low effort into an exposed net after Rico had only punched to the edge of the area.\nFulham, the only Premier League side without an away win this season, found little in response and Ward-Prowse - the game's stellar performer - was first to react after Redmond's low effort from 18 yards was palmed out.\nThere were other noteworthy positives in the way Romeu and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg broke up play with ease, each winning possession back 11 times. Romeu also kept possession better than any player on the pitch, completing 94% of his 49 passes.\nIt was composed and relatively routine for the home side. After an uplift in form following Hasenhuttl's December appointment, Saints had shown signs of decline in recent weeks but this win moves them out of the bottom three at a timely point with fixtures against Manchester United and Tottenham to come next.\n'You don't know what you're doing'\nA second-half moment featuring Cairney summed up Fulham.\nThe Scottish midfielder battled to win a ball in a feisty exchange with Ward-Prowse and then out-muscled another Southampton player to win a corner, only for Joe Bryan to float the delivery straight out of play.\nThe Cottagers were clearly trying but moments of quality were non-existent and Cairney's substitution saw fans react angrily. Banners criticising the club's hierarchy were unfurled, while another hailing former manager Slavisa Jokanovic was also held aloft.\nChants of \"you don't know what you're doing\" were aimed at the manager, who later said his team will \"fight until it is mathematically impossible\" in their battle against the drop.\nAny escape will undoubtedly require magic from Mitrovic, who remains a constant target for long balls. But defeat at St Mary's showed if his admirable hold up play comes up short, the Cottagers have little else to offer.\nShots over the bar when Mitrovic would have expected to work the keeper either side of half-time ultimately ensured there was no way back, and Babel's shot onto the woodwork late on was against the run of play.\nDespite their lowly league position and urgent need for points, Ranieri's side only had four touches in the Southampton area in the second period.\nThey have not won an away league fixture since the final day of the Championship season in May and now face Chelsea, a Leicester side boasting a new manager, Liverpool and Manchester City in their next four games.\nRelegation is seemingly rapidly approaching.\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse\nSaints' improving home form - stats\nSouthampton have won two of their past four Premier League home games (D1 L1), as many wins as they managed in their previous 21 at St Mary's (D10 L9\nFulham have lost seven of their past eight Premier League games (W1), conceding at least twice in all eight.\nSouthampton have beaten a newly promoted team for the first time since May 2017 (2-1 against Middlesbrough), having failed to do so in their past 10 Premier League games against such teams (D5 L5).\nSouthampton are now unbeaten in their past 20 home league games against Fulham (W14 D6), since a 2-21loss in October 1935 (second tier). Only against Coventry (22 games) have they ever had a longer unbeaten home run in their league history.\n'A win without mistakes' - manager reaction\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a very important win for the whole club.

        "article_text": "Arsenal 5-1 Bournemouth: Gunners score five to stay in top four\nArsenal stayed a point ahead of Manchester United in the race for the Champions League by thrashing Bournemouth to earn their eighth straight Premier League home win.\nMesut Ozil, recalled to the side, fired the Gunners ahead before he set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan to sweep in.\nA defensive mistake allowed Bournemouth to pull a goal back through Lys Mousset's simple finish, but any hopes the visitors had of ending a miserable run of eight successive league defeats on the road quickly ended after the break.\nSkipper Laurent Koscielny blasted in off the post following a set-piece, then Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang added another when he was given the space to race clear and calmly slot in.\nSubstitute Alexandre Lacazette sealed victory with a sublime free-kick as Arsenal warmed up for Saturday's north London derby in style.\nSpurs' defeat at Chelsea leaves Arsenal now four points behind their arch-rivals, with a buoyant Emirates Stadium warning \"Tottenham Hotspur, we're coming for you!\" as they celebrated a rampant win.\nBournemouth's visit was seen as a must-win by Gunners fans with, what would should be, trickier tests to come against Spurs and Manchester United in their next two Premier League games.\nThese matches - plus the two-legged Europa League last-16 tie against Rennes - look set to define manager Unai Emery's first season at the helm.\nA healthy points haul against Spurs and United would consolidate the Gunners' place in the top four as they head into the final stretch.\nBut failure to beat either would leave the race for the Champions League - which Arsenal have missed out on for the past two campaigns - wide open.\nFollow reaction to Arsenal's win and all the other Premier League action\nDid Ozil impress on his Premier League recall?\nOzil, 30, has become somewhat of a peripheral figure at the Emirates under Unai Emery this season, making just 14 league starts and often left out of the side because of concerns from the Spaniard about his form or fitness.\nThe German was restored to the starting line-up against Bate Borisov in the Europa League last week and made a decent impression when he came on as a substitute against Southampton on Sunday.\nThat led to Emery giving another opportunity to the club's star name, and highest-paid player, against Bournemouth - and Ozil repaid him with a classy performance in what was only his second start of the year in the Premier League.\nThe former Real Madrid midfielder lined up in a central attacking midfield role, alongside Mkhitaryan and behind Aubameyang, linking up to both players with good effect.\nArsenal made the perfect start when Ozil opened the scoring after four minutes with a lofted left-foot finish which Bournemouth keeper Artur Boruc could not prevent looping in.\nAnd then he showed outstanding awareness to unselfishly square for the in-form Mkhitaryan, who pounced on a sloppy cross-field pass from Bournemouth full-back Adam Smith before playing a one-two with Ozil, to slot in.\nOzil continued to make Arsenal tick throughout and was unlucky not to add another goal himself - when Arsenal led 3-1 - with a low side-footed effort which cannoned back off the post.\n\"Mesut helped us with his quality and work,\" Emery said afterwards. \"All the players should be proud tonight and it is the same for Mesut.\"\nOzil's goal was his first since netting in a sublime individual performance against Leicester back in October, before he teed up Mkhitaryan for a first assist in nine league matches.\nWhether that was enough to maintain his place against Spurs remains to be seen, but he certainly could not have done more to impress Emery - albeit against a poor Bournemouth side.\nBournemouth need to readdress away form - Howe\nBournemouth have an abysmal record on the road in recent months, having not won an away league game since thumping Fulham at Craven Cottage on 27 October.\nThe Cherries have lost all nine matches since, with this thumping meaning they have conceded 21 goals in their past six trips alone.\nManager Eddie Howe has been playing down the rotten run, insisting the problem is Bournemouth's general inconsistency rather than a specific mental block when it comes to travelling away.\n\"Maybe I need to readdress that,\" Howe said. \"We have spoke at length with the players, it is nothing we haven't discussed, but we have to put that into action.\"\nAt Arsenal, they were undone by quick goals at the start of each half.\nIf sloppy defending to go 2-0 down after less than half an hour was bad enough, it got worse when they switched off again after finding a foothold in the game.\nWithin 90 seconds of the second half restarting, the Cherries defence stood static as Koscielny reacted quickest to convert Mkhitaryan's low cross with the aid of a deflection.\nFrom that point there was no going back - despite Dan Gosling hitting a speculative effort against the crossbar at 3-1 - as they lost nine consecutive away games for the first time since the 1933-34 season.\nDespite sliding to 12th position, they remain nine points above the relegation zone with 10 matches remaining - although Howe is refusing to be complacent about their survival.\n\"We're always looking over shoulder because we need points and we need results,\" Howe added.\n\"Whether we are safe or not we need to pride ourselves on being our best and we were way short of that today.\"\n'We imposed our superiority' - post-match reaction\nArsenal manager Unai Emery:\n\"We worked with intensity and we imposed, little by little over the 90 minutes, our superiority.\n\"In the first half after we went 2-0 up, they gave us problems. But we showed maturity to continue pushing and doing our work. The second half was good for us.\n\"It was a good performance and we can be proud of every player.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe:\n\"Arsenal did have individuals who played well and they were too good for us. But that mindset takes away ownership of what we delivered with our own team.\n\"They may have played well but our perspective is clear that we can do so much better and are capable of much more than that.\n\"We will not kid ourselves and our analysis has to be that it was not acceptable.\"\nMan of the match - Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Arsenal)\nA high five for Emery - the stats\nArsenal are unbeaten in their last 14 Premier League home games, winning 12 and drawing two, and winning each of the last eight in a row.\nBournemouth have lost their last nine Premier League away games, conceding at least two goals each time.\nBournemouth's goal was the 1,000th Arsenal have conceded in Premier League history, becoming the eighth team to have conceded that many in the competition.\nArsenal scored five goals in a Premier League home game for the first time since May 2018 (5-0 v Burnley) in what was Arsene Wenger's final home match in charge of the club.\nOzil's opener for Arsenal was his 50th goal involvement in 85 Premier League appearances at Emirates Stadium - 19 goals and 32 assists.\nArsenal's Aubameyang scored his 26th Premier League goal - only Mohamed Salah (30) has scored more than him since his debut.\nLacazette is the fifth different player to score in five-plus consecutive home Premier League games for Arsenal, and the first since Robin van Persie in March 2012.\nWhat's next?\nFor Arsenal, the short trip to Wembley to face arch-rivals Tottenham. The north London derby kicks off at 12:30 GMT on Saturday.\nBournemouth face another of the top clubs when they host Manchester City at 15:00 on the same day."

It is of course not right,\" Klopp told BBC Sport afterwards.\n\"These boys are outstanding and today they showed so much passion.\"\nWith 10 games of the league season left, Liverpool stay one point clear of nearest rivals Manchester City, who beat West Ham 1-0 on Wednesday.\nKlopp's side were 2-0 ahead in 20 minutes as Senegal forward Mane headed the first before doubling the lead with an outrageous backheel, Trent Alexander-Arnold providing both assists.\nMohamed Salah hit the post before Divock Origi beat Ben Foster at his near post to make it 3-0.\nVan Dijk scored two late headers, including one from another Alexander-Arnold assist.\nReaction from Anfield and the rest of Wednesday's Premier League games\nRampant Reds back in the groove\nKlopp went on the pitch at the full-time whistle to applaud Liverpool's fans and headed back to the dressing room with a huge smile and his arm draped around Alexander-Arnold's shoulder.\nThe 20-year-old England defender marked his return to the side, after being left out of Sunday's draw at Manchester United, with an outstanding performance as poor Watford were put to the sword.\nAlexander-Arnold's pace caused the Hornets' defence all sorts of problems while Adam Masina had a torrid time at the hands of Salah.\nThis was a timely return to winning ways for Liverpool after one win in their previous five league and cup games.\nMane's header set them on their way but it was his second which showed Liverpool had their swagger back - a spectacular backheel past Foster.\nOrigi has been a spectator for most of the season, but with Roberto Firmino missing because of an ankle injury, the Belgium forward marked his rare appearance with a right-foot finish in front of the Kop.\nBefore this game, Van Dijk had scored one goal for his club this season but found the net twice in the space of three minutes as Watford caved in.\nLiverpool will face tougher opponents during the run-in, while they will be replaced at the top of the table on Saturday if City avoid defeat at Bournemouth as Klopp's side are not in action until Sunday at Everton.\nHowever, there is fresh optimism at Anfield after a resounding win.\n\"We have 69 points,\" added Klopp.\n\"We could have had 75 but we are having a really good season. Let's enjoy the ride and see where it takes us.\"\nAnother Anfield thrashing for Watford\nWatford have had a terrific season under Javi Gracia, the Spaniard guiding the Hornets to a 'best of the rest' seventh spot in the table and a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals.\nYet they were blown away by Liverpool in such a manner that Wolves, who were not playing, moved ahead of them because of a superior goal difference.\nWatford's last three visits to Anfield have resulted in 5-0, 5-0 and 6-1 defeats.\nThis was their seventh loss in eight top-flight games against the 'big six' this season - and they rarely looked like getting back into the match once Mane headed Liverpool in front inside 10 minutes.\nTroy Deeney spent most the night helping out in defence as Watford were overwhelmed by the home team.\n\"Our target was to win but when you find an opponent like Liverpool then it's very hard to get the points,\" said Gracia.\n\"It's important to be calm and keep confidence in ourselves now because our levels have been good.\"\nTheir next away game is at Manchester City on 9 March. Liverpool will hope Gracia's side can give a better account of themselves at Etihad Stadium than they did at Anfield.\nMan of the match - Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool)\nWhy Anfield is a fortress - the stats\nLiverpool are now unbeaten at Anfield in the Premier League in their past 35 matches, the first side in the competition to reach this number of matches without defeat since Manchester City in December 2012 (37 games).\nWatford have become the first side in Premier League history to concede at least five goals in three successive away matches against a single opponent in the competition.\nSadio Mane's double for Liverpool were his 13th and 14th Premier League goals of the season.\nDivock Origi has had a hand in 11 goals in his past 18 Premier League starts for Liverpool (seven goals, four assists).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool now turn their attention to neighbours Everton and Sunday's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park (16:15 GMT). On the same day Watford host Leicester City in Brendan Rodgers' first match in charge of the Foxes (12:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 5-1 Bournemouth: Gunners score five to stay in top four\nArsenal stayed a point ahead of Manchester United in the race for the Champions League by thrashing Bournemouth to earn their eighth straight Premier League home win.\nMesut Ozil, recalled to the side, fired the Gunners ahead before he set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan to sweep in.\nA defensive mistake allowed Bournemouth to pull a goal back through Lys Mousset's simple finish, but any hopes the visitors had of ending a miserable run of eight successive league defeats on the road quickly ended after the break.\nSkipper Laurent Koscielny blasted in off the post following a set-piece, then Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang added another when he was given the space to race clear and calmly slot in.\nSubstitute Alexandre Lacazette sealed victory with a sublime free-kick as Arsenal warmed up for Saturday's north London derby in style.\nSpurs' defeat at Chelsea leaves Arsenal now four points behind their arch-rivals, with a buoyant Emirates Stadium warning \"Tottenham Hotspur, we're coming for you!\" as they celebrated a rampant win.\nBournemouth's visit was seen as a must-win by Gunners fans with, what would should be, trickier tests to come against Spurs and Manchester United in their next two Premier League games.\nThese matches - plus the two-legged Europa League last-16 tie against Rennes - look set to define manager Unai Emery's first season at the helm.\nA healthy points haul against Spurs and United would consolidate the Gunners' place in the top four as they head into the final stretch.\nBut failure to beat either would leave the race for the Champions League - which Arsenal have missed out on for the past two campaigns - wide open.\nFollow reaction to Arsenal's win and all the other Premier League action\nDid Ozil impress on his Premier League recall?\nOzil, 30, has become somewhat of a peripheral figure at the Emirates under Unai Emery this season, making just 14 league starts and often left out of the side because of concerns from the Spaniard about his form or fitness.\nThe German was restored to the starting line-up against Bate Borisov in the Europa League last week and made a decent impression when he came on as a substitute against Southampton on Sunday.\nThat led to Emery giving another opportunity to the club's star name, and highest-paid player, against Bournemouth - and Ozil repaid him with a classy performance in what was only his second start of the year in the Premier League.\nThe former Real Madrid midfielder lined up in a central attacking midfield role, alongside Mkhitaryan and behind Aubameyang, linking up to both players with good effect.\nArsenal made the perfect start when Ozil opened the scoring after four minutes with a lofted left-foot finish which Bournemouth keeper Artur Boruc could not prevent looping in.\nAnd then he showed outstanding awareness to unselfishly square for the in-form Mkhitaryan, who pounced on a sloppy cross-field pass from Bournemouth full-back Adam Smith before playing a one-two with Ozil, to slot in.\nOzil continued to make Arsenal tick throughout and was unlucky not to add another goal himself - when Arsenal led 3-1 - with a low side-footed effort which cannoned back off the post.\n\"Mesut helped us with his quality and work,\" Emery said afterwards. \"All the players should be proud tonight and it is the same for Mesut.\"\nOzil's goal was his first since netting in a sublime individual performance against Leicester back in October, before he teed up Mkhitaryan for a first assist in nine league matches.\nWhether that was enough to maintain his place against Spurs remains to be seen, but he certainly could not have done more to impress Emery - albeit against a poor Bournemouth side.\nBournemouth need to readdress away form - Howe\nBournemouth have an abysmal record on the road in recent months, having not won an away league game since thumping Fulham at Craven Cottage on 27 October.\nThe Cherries have lost all nine matches since, with this thumping meaning they have conceded 21 goals in their past six trips alone.\nManager Eddie Howe has been playing down the rotten run, insisting the problem is Bournemouth's general inconsistency rather than a specific mental block when it comes to travelling away.\n\"Maybe I need to readdress that,\" Howe said. \"We have spoke at length with the players, it is nothing we haven't discussed, but we have to put that into action.\"\nAt Arsenal, they were undone by quick goals at the start of each half.\nIf sloppy defending to go 2-0 down after less than half an hour was bad enough, it got worse when they switched off again after finding a foothold in the game.\nWithin 90 seconds of the second half restarting, the Cherries defence stood static as Koscielny reacted quickest to convert Mkhitaryan's low cross with the aid of a deflection.\nFrom that point there was no going back - despite Dan Gosling hitting a speculative effort against the crossbar at 3-1 - as they lost nine consecutive away games for the first time since the 1933-34 season.\nDespite sliding to 12th position, they remain nine points above the relegation zone with 10 matches remaining - although Howe is refusing to be complacent about their survival.\n\"We're always looking over shoulder because we need points and we need results,\" Howe added.\n\"Whether we are safe or not we need to pride ourselves on being our best and we were way short of that today.\"\n'We imposed our superiority' - post-match reaction\nArsenal manager Unai Emery:\n\"We worked with intensity and we imposed, little by little over the 90 minutes, our superiority.\n\"In the first half after we went 2-0 up, they gave us problems. But we showed maturity to continue pushing and doing our work. The second half was good for us.\n\"It was a good performance and we can be proud of every player.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe:\n\"Arsenal did have individuals who played well and they were too good for us. But that mindset takes away ownership of what we delivered with our own team.\n\"They may have played well but our perspective is clear that we can do so much better and are capable of much more than that.\n\"We will not kid ourselves and our analysis has to be that it was not acceptable.\"\nMan of the match - Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Arsenal)\nA high five for Emery - the stats\nArsenal are unbeaten in their last 14 Premier League home games, winning 12 and drawing two, and winning each of the last eight in a row.\nBournemouth have lost their last nine Premier League away games, conceding at least two goals each time.\nBournemouth's goal was the 1,000th Arsenal have conceded in Premier League history, becoming the eighth team to have conceded that many in the competition.\nArsenal scored five goals in a Premier League home game for the first time since May 2018 (5-0 v Burnley) in what was Arsene Wenger's final home match in charge of the club.\nOzil's opener for Arsenal was his 50th goal involvement in 85 Premier League appearances at Emirates Stadium - 19 goals and 32 assists.\nArsenal's Aubameyang scored his 26th Premier League goal - only Mohamed Salah (30) has scored more than him since his debut.\nLacazette is the fifth different player to score in five-plus consecutive home Premier League games for Arsenal, and the first since Robin van Persie in March 2012.\nWhat's next?\nFor Arsenal, the short trip to Wembley to face arch-rivals Tottenham. The north London derby kicks off at 12:30 GMT on Saturday.\nBournemouth face another of the top clubs when they host Manchester City at 15:00 on the same day."

        "article_text": "Man City 1-0 West Ham: Sergio Aguero scores penalty to seal win for City\nManchester City needed a second-half Sergio Aguero penalty to see off West Ham and stay one point behind leaders Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.\nThe defending champions had to wait for the Argentina striker's 59th-minute spot-kick to break down the well-organised Hammers, but ultimately it was enough to secure a vital victory.\nCity, who are still chasing glory on three fronts after winning the Carabao Cup on Sunday, showed off that trophy before kick-off and tore into the visitors in the opening minutes.\nBut the closest they came to an early goal was when David Silva turned Kevin de Bruyne's cross on to a post and West Ham soon began to frustrate them.\nThe Hammers did not threaten at all at the other end until Andy Carroll brought a fine save from Ederson with their first shot of the game at the start of the second half.\nHowever, they succeeded in keeping City quiet and, with Liverpool on their way to a 5-0 win over Watford, the home fans' frustration began to show.\nCity were utterly dominant on the ball with more than 80% of possession but they needed the introduction of Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva off the bench to provide the spark they needed in attack.\nSilva took a matter of minutes to make an impact, cutting into the box from the right and going down under pressure from Felipe Anderson, to prompt referee Stuart Atwell to point to the spot.\nAguero made no mistake, sending Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way for his 25th goal of the season\nMore City chances followed, with Ryan Fredericks clearing off the line from Silva and Sterling missing the target from close range, but in the end one goal was sufficient.\n\"Many things are going to happen,\" manager Pep Guardiola said. \"I think we are going to drop points and Liverpool are going to drop points so we are going to see, until the end.\"\nMahrez fails to take chance to impress\nWith City having lost just one of their past 15 games before taking on West Ham, it is clear there is not much wrong with Guardiola's side at the moment and they coped well enough without the injured Fernandinho here.\nOne area for concern is the form of Riyad Mahrez, who became City's \u00a360m record signing when he joined from Leicester last summer.\nThe Algerian has not had many opportunities recently - this was his first Premier League start of the year - but he did not take his chance to impress Guardiola.\nDespite being up against a teenage debutant, Ben Johnson, Mahrez struggled to impose himself on the right flank and his final ball, whether a pass or a shot, was frequently disappointing.\nIt was no surprise when he was replaced by Sterling just 10 minutes into the second half.\nAnother substitute, Bernardo Silva, replaced Leroy Sane and took Mahrez's place on the right soon afterwards and the pair added much-needed energy to City's flanks, with Silva quickly winning the penalty that Aguero scored.\n\"Bernardo is a master - an incredible player at reading that situation,\" said Guardiola.\n\"Riyad played good - he took some risks and unfortunately he hit the first player often. Normally he is so clinical, such a good player at finishing in the first action with the right foot, but of course sometimes you need time to connect between the players and that is going to happen.\"\nNo points for Pellegrini despite game plan\nManuel Pellegrini's City sides were known for their attacking verve but the Chilean demonstrated defensive diligence on his first return to his old club.\nThe Hammers boss, who took City to the title in 2014, waved to the home fans when they chanted his name in the opening minutes but it was soon clear that he had a plan to frustrate them.\nWith Pedro Obiang and Declan Rice protecting a solid back four, they sat in their own half and gave City little space to operate in.\nWhen the ball did come near the Hammers area, Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna were in the right place to deal with it and of City's 11 shots in the first half, only one was on target.\nIt took a debatable penalty to end their resistance and, although West Ham are now winless in their past six league and cup games on the road, this was a defensive performance that will offer Pellegrini plenty of encouragement.\n\"To be generous, it was a little soft, but that is too generous - it was not a penalty,\" said Pellegrini.\n\"It was a play that happens a lot of times inside the box - in the other box Manuel Lanzini had exactly the same play and he did not fall to the floor.\n\"So if we lose this game with another action maybe you can accept it, but not that penalty.\"\nMan of the match - Bernardo Silva (Manchester City)\nCity extend winning run against Hammers - the stats\nMan City have won each of their past seven games against West Ham in all competitions, netting 23 goals while conceding just three.\nWest Ham are now winless in their past 18 Premier League away games against 'big six' opposition (D6 L12).\nCity have won 16 of their past 17 home games in all competitions, only losing to Crystal Palace in a league game in December (3-2).\nCity striker Aguero has been directly involved in 74 goals (59 goals and 15 assists) in 80 Premier League appearances since Guardiola took over in August 2016 - only Harry Kane has been directly involved in more in that time (87).\nCity's Oleksandr Zinchenko has been on the winning side in each of his first 13 Premier League appearances (11 starts), the longest run of wins from the start of a player's career in the competition's history.\nGuardiola has more top-flight league wins against Pellegrini (nine) than he does any other opposition manager.\nGuardiola has won all seven of his meetings with West Ham in all competitions. The only side he has met more often while maintaining a 100% win rate is Malaga, who he has beaten eight times, including four games while they were managed by Pellegrini.\nWhat's next?\nCity head for the south coast next, travelling to play Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00 GMT). West Ham are at home to Newcastle later the same day (17:30)."

He's had a different role because of Marcus Rashford's form.\n\"He got a chance up front. Two very good finishes, could have had another one as well earlier on, so I am very pleased for Rom. He is a quality finisher.\n\"It's great to have him around the place, always happy, always working on his finishing. He's played more than you think, but he's played wide right, wide left, so it's Rash's form that has moved him out there.\n\"Now with Rash's injury, he grabbed his chance.\"\nUnited were under pressure late on but Ashley Young drilled in a third for the victory as United stay fifth in the table, a point behind Arsenal who hammered Bournemouth 5-1, while Palace remain 14th.\nRelive Manchester United's win over Crystal Palace\nMixed showing from United\nThere were major concerns before the game that boss Solskjaer may have to field a significantly-weakened United side, having seen three players stricken by injury in the first half against Liverpool last Sunday.\nBut the Norwegian managed to put out a fairly strong eleven, giving a start to \u00a347m summer signing Fred for his first appearance since 5 January in the FA Cup.\nThe former Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder was shaky early on, being outmuscled off the ball too often and playing loose passes, but his 84.5% pass accuracy was bettered only by defender Victor Lindelof.\nSolskjaer, who has repeatedly spoken about the traditions of Manchester United, took the opportunity to hand a debut to 17-year-old youth team midfielder James Garner for the final minute, replacing Fred.\nForward Alexis Sanchez failed to impress in another lacklustre showing, but striker Lukaku scored two well-taken goals, having missed a glorious chance in the opening 10 minutes when he volleyed over from close range.\nThe former Chelsea, Everton and West Brom man moved into the Premier League's top 20 all-time leading scorers, his 111 strikes drawing him level with Dion Dublin.\nAt the back, full-back Luke Shaw followed up his excellent showing against Liverpool with another solid performance, while Young kept Wilfried Zaha quiet and capped his display with a goal.\nPalace's United curse continues\nPalace's unwanted record of having never beaten Manchester United in a Premier League game continued, extending the run to 20 games. The loss also brought to an end a run of six unbeaten games in all competitions.\nFormer England boss Roy Hodgson has now lost 12 top-flight matches against United - more than he has against any other club.\nThe Eagles should have gone ahead when Andros Townsend clipped a shot over from close range, while Michy Batshuayi headed over and skipper Luka Milivojevic struck a free-kick wide.\nDefender Ward pulled a goal back in the second half and the Englishman was imposing at the back too - his three tackles, three clearances and winning the ball back seven times could not be surpassed by a team-mate.\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson said: \"When we scored it was a result of the pressure we exerted.\n\"We made a few changes to try and get something from the game and, as so often happens against teams of this quality, they find a way of picking you off with a third goal.\n\"No doubt they're playing very well. Their organisation and work-rate was good. They do have some very, very good players on top of that and they sometimes find a way to punish you, as Lukaku did.\"\nWhat next?\nPalace travel to Burnley on Saturday (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while United host Southampton at the same time.\nLukaku enjoys playing away - the stats\nManchester United have won eight consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time in their history.\nCrystal Palace have played more Premier League games without ever winning against Man Utd (D4 L16) than any side has against another in the competition's history.\nManchester United are unbeaten in their last 22 league games against Crystal Palace, since a 0-3 away defeat in May 1991 (W18 D4).\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has lost more Premier League matches against Man Utd (12) than he has against any other side.\nEight of Romelu Lukaku's 10 Premier League goals this season have been scored away from home - only Harry Kane (10) has netted more on the road in 2018-19 so far.\nMan Utd's Romelu Lukaku has scored in seven of his last 10 Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace, including in three of his four games for the Red Devils.\nJames McArthur became just the fourth player to reach 150 appearances for Crystal Palace in the Premier League after Joel Ward, Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha.\nCrystal Palace's Joel Ward ended a run of 86 Premier League appearances without a goal, since netting against Chelsea in August 2015."

analysis\nSpurs show grit but little inspiration\nSpurs proved once again they possess real resilience as they battled to earn this point - but there is no escaping that this has been an indifferent week for Pochettino's side.\nSeven days ago, Tottenham still harboured outside hopes of the Premier League title but a return of one point from away games at Burnley and Chelsea and this Wembley derby against Arsenal have snuffed out those aspirations.\nAnd in the end, they will be grateful to Arsenal's wastefulness for a draw that maintains their four-point gap over their local rivals in fourth, and six over Manchester United in fifth.\nThere were pluses for Spurs in the outstanding performance of Moussa Sissoko but they currently look a side short on spark, summed up by Kieran Trippier's lack of confidence, the defender who was an England hero when they reached the World Cup semi-final in the summer feeling the full fury of his own fans for one wayward second-half cross.\nTottenham can at least look at that important advantage over Arsenal but they looked short of energy and inspiration here as they take a 3-0 lead to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.\nArsenal's self-inflicted wounds\nArsenal manager Emery will have seen plenty to please him in this eventful encounter - but he will know his side missed a huge chance to turn up the pressure on Spurs in the race for a top-four place.\nEmery's initial team selection, which saw Aubameyang, Torreira and Mesut Ozil on the bench, raised eyebrows but it almost resulted in a win that would have put them within one point of Spurs, only for Arsenal to suffer from self-inflicted wounds.\nLacazette was a major culprit having been given the nod ahead of Aubameyang, wasting an early chance then repeating his mistake in the second half, skewing wide from close range after superb build-up play from Alex Iwobi and Nacho Monreal.\nIt would have given Arsenal a two-goal cushion and only increased the tension mounting around Wembley at that time.\nArsenal were aggrieved with the penalty decision, claiming for offside and believing Mustafi's push on Kane was a soft one, although the defender allowed himself to get in a poor position.\nThe final anguish was Aubameyang's lackadaisical penalty after he was fouled by Davinson Sanchez, showing no urgency or intent and giving Lloris a relative easy save.\nThis was a result that could have been much better - and Arsenal may yet look back on it as a very damaging one in their pursuit of qualifying for next season's Champions League.\nMan of the match - Moussa Sissoko (Tottenham)\n'We are doing it our way' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am so happy because we didn't deserve to lose the game - we were better than them so it would be a shame to lose the game in that way.\n\"I am happy with the performance, it was a tough game and difficult to play Arsenal but I am happy after two defeats to take a positive result to build confidence for Tuesday, to go to Borussia Dortmund and go through to the next stage of the Champions League.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"We are fine in our way, being competitive and adapting our performance. It demanded a lot of transition for us and it is good, not the result because we can win, but we can be stronger in our mentality after this match going forward.\n\"We are thinking each match for three points, to continue in our way, our target is clear. We can be proud of everybody in our work. We showed everybody we are creating and doing it our way.\"\nSpurs finally draw a game - the stats\nThe result ends Tottenham's run of 28 Premier League games without a draw - the third longest run ever without a draw from the start of a top-flight season.\nArsenal remain the only side in the Premier League yet to register an away clean sheet this season.\nMeetings between Spurs and Arsenal in the Premier League have seen both sides score on 36 occasions - more than any other fixture in the competition.\nNo fixture in Premier League history has seen more goals from penalties than the 18 between these two clubs.\nAaron Ramsey has been directly involved in three of Arsenal's last four Premier League goals against Tottenham.\nArsenal's Alexandre Lacazette has registered a goal involvement in four consecutive Premier League games for the first time ever.\nAnd Lacazette has now been directly involved in 36 goals in the Premier League for Arsenal since his debut in August 2017, more than any other player.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane has scored nine goals in nine Premier League north London derbies, eclipsing the eight scored by Emmanuel Adebayor.\nKane has scored nine of Tottenham's last 12 Premier League goals against Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham take a 3-0 lead into the second-leg of their Champions League last-16 tie away to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), while Arsenal travel to Rennes for the first leg of their last-16 meeting on Thursday (17:55 GMT)."

I have been part of it so many times myself.\"\nYan Valery had given struggling Saints a surprise lead with an outstanding finish from around 25 yards before United turned it around with two goals in six second-half minutes.\nAndreas Pereira equalised with a spectacular long-range strike before setting up Lukaku to make it 2-1.\nSaints fought back to make it 2-2 through James Ward-Prowse's exquisite free-kick before Lukaku's dramatic winner.\nIn an incident-packed match, Paul Pogba missed the chance to make it 4-2 when Angus Gunn saved his late penalty.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nHow long before United appoint Solskjaer?\nWhen Solskjaer was appointed interim manager in December following Jose Mourinho's dismissal, third place looked a distant dream for United.\nYet since the Norwegian took charge, United have won at least five more Premier League points than any other side.\nHaving moved ahead of Arsenal in the table with victory over Southampton, United will extend their lead over the Gunners to four points with eight matches remaining if they beat Unai Emery's side in London on 10 March.\nAfter falling behind to Valery's sensational strike, United struggled to get into any rhythm before Diogo Dalot's 52nd minute introduction for Alexis Sanchez, who looks to have suffered a suspected knee injury.\nPereira's curled finish was of the highest quality and Lukaku showed great composure to make it 2-1 with a low, controlled finish.\nYet United, who had failed to win their previous three home games, looked like they would have to settle for a point after Ward-Prowse's free-kick made it 2-2.\nHowever, there is a never-say-die spirit about Solskjaer's United and Lukaku celebrated wildly after hitting the winner - the 113th Premier League goal of his career.\n\"He is a quality scorer,\" added Solskjaer when asked about the Belgium forward's two-goal contribution.\n\"We need to have him more in front of the goal. But he has done fantastic in his work rate, attitude, he loves scoring goals, he smiles every day, he does extra shooting in training.\"\nThere was still time for Pogba to miss from the penalty spot after Stuart Armstrong had fouled Marcus Rashford.\nBut even that failed to dampen the mood of the home fans, many of whom left Old Trafford asking: how long before United's hierarchy make Solskjaer's appointment permanent?\nPositives in defeat for Saints\nSouthampton remain two points above the relegation zone after a third defeat in four games.\nYet there are reasons to be optimistic about their survival chances over the next nine games despite ending up with nothing from a battling performance.\nWhile Valery's opening goal was sumptuous, Southampton's response to falling 2-1 behind shows there is character and spirit flowing through Ralph Hasenhuttl's side.\nThe Saints still have to play Tottenham and Liverpool but their run-in also includes home games against Huddersfield and Bournemouth.\nIn addition, they will feel confident about away games against Brighton, Newcastle and West Ham if they can put in the same level of commitment as they did against United.\nWhen Hasenhuttl took charge in December, Southampton were one point from safety. Despite this result, they have 18 points from 14 games and staying up is very much in their own hands.\nMan of the match - Andreas Pereira (Manchester United)\n'We deserved more' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"We deserved more. We played a fantastic game tactically. We showed we can play with the ball and pressed them.\n\"We didn't stop working. It doesn't feel good because we lost but it starts from 0-0 in our next match against Tottenham.\n\"It is not enough that we played for 60-70 minutes in a very good way against such a side.\"\n'Solskjaer planning for next season'\nAnalysis: Former England captain Alan Shearer, speaking on Match of the Day\nWhat a job Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is doing. Manchester United were 11 points off the top four when took he over and they've made that up.\nIt doesn't matter whether he gets the job next week or at the end of the season - he's getting it. Decisions are being made now behind the scenes for pre-season, players coming in and players going out.\nHe's making those decisions.\nComeback kings against Saints - the stats\nManchester United have come from behind to win nine Premier League matches against Southampton, an outright record in the competition.\nSouthampton are the first away team to score two goals from outside the box in a Premier League game at Old Trafford since Manchester City in September 2009.\nUnited striker Romelu Lukaku has been involved in 11 goals in his last 11 Premier League appearances against Southampton (9 goals, 2 assists).\nAndreas Pereira became the first Brazilian to score and assist in a Premier League game for Manchester United since Anderson in May 2011 v Blackpool.\nSouthampton's James Ward-Prowse has scored five Premier League goals this season, more than in any other campaign in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nTrailing 2-0 from the first leg, United are in need of another comeback win when they go to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday (20:00 GMT). The games don't get any easier for Southampton - it's Spurs at St Mary's next Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-1 Manchester City: Riyad Mahrez sends City back to top of table\nPep Guardiola says Manchester City's win at Bournemouth was \"one of the best performances we've ever played\" as the champions overcame injuries to Kevin de Bruyne and John Stones to go two points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nThe champions lost De Bruyne and Stones either side of the break before Riyad Mahrez - on for Belgian De Bruyne - scored the only goal of the game early in the second half.\n\"[It was] an incredible performance - one of the best performances we've ever played,\" said Guardiola.\n\"We didn't concede one shot on target, we were committed at set-pieces defensively, every time we lost the ball we had three or four guys going to recover the ball.\n\"It was incredible how well they played today - the way they helped each other was fantastic.\"\nHamstrung De Bruyne to be out 'for a while', warns Guardiola\nIt was a second 1-0 win in the space of four days for City, who once again dominated possession but were forced to be patient against dogged and defensive opponents.\nThey only created one clear-cut opportunity in the first half, when David Silva met De Bruyne's low cross but could only side-foot wide.\nSeconds before the break they suffered their first injury blow when De Bruyne went down unchallenged and immediately signalled to the bench that he wanted to come off.\nIt was the same scenario at the start of the second period, with John Stones walking off the field to be replaced by Vincent Kompany.\nDespite those setbacks, City continued to push forward and deservedly took the lead after 55 minutes. Charlie Daniels failed to properly clear Bernardo Silva's pass, the ball falling to Silva who teed up Mahrez to fire home at Artur Boruc's near post.\nThe Bournemouth goalkeeper could possibly have done better, but made up for it with a series of impressive stops to keep the score at 1-0.\nThe 39-year-old showed great athleticism to tip Sergio Aguero's lofted long-range effort on to the bar before pushing Mahrez's header away from point-blank range.\nBournemouth offered little as an attacking force in reply, failing to have a shot at goal or force a single corner.\nCity's win puts the pressure back on title rivals Liverpool, who can return to the summit with victory over Everton in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Sunday.\nMan City win - but at what cost?\nThe sight of a pumped-up Guardiola passionately hugging all his players on the pitch at the final whistle highlighted the importance of this win in an increasingly fascinating title race.\nThe result was just reward for City's patience and determination, as they stuck to their possession-based approach even though they failed to break through a packed defence early on.\nThe champions had 82% possession, forced 14 corners and had 23 shots at goal in a win that was a lot more comfortable than the scoreline suggests.\nThe victory came at cost however, with Guardiola confirming De Bruyne came off with a hamstring injury while Stones was substituted as a precaution.\nWith Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte already sidelined, even a squad as talented as City's is being stretched.\nGuardiola will have been delighted therefore with the impact of Mahrez, who was ineffective against West Ham in midweek but was much improved here.\nThe City boss was also boosted by the return of Gabriel Jesus, who came on as a late substitute after three weeks out with a hamstring injury.\nBoth are likely to play a key role in the coming weeks, with this game the first of five matches across three competitions in a hectic March for City as they seek an unprecedented quadruple.\nBournemouth battle but are blunt in attack\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe responded to Wednesday's 5-1 thrashing at Arsenal by switching formation to a back three, with wing-backs Nathaniel Clyne and Charlie Daniels effectively making it a back five.\nThe plan was clear - defend deep in numbers and limit the space for City's forward players in dangerous areas.\nThe Cherries have the worst defensive record outside the bottom three, so it was an understandable approach against the most prolific side in the division.\nThe formation worked perfectly in the first half, with Nathan Ake superbly marshalling the defence alongside Chris Mepham and Jack Simpson, the latter making his first Premier League appearance of the season.\nThat approach obviously needed changing once Mahrez put the visitors ahead, but Howe waited until the 75th minute before bringing on an extra forward in Lys Mousset.\nThe tactical change had little impact, with the Cherries failing to test Ederson with a single shot on target throughout the 90 minutes.\nHowe will hope the imminent return of top-scorer Callum Wilson after six weeks out with a hamstring injury will boost his blunted attack as they seek the points the Bournemouth manager still feels they need to banish any lingering fears of relegation.\nMan of the match - Artur Boruc (Bournemouth)\n'The players deserve my admiration' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Sport: \"\"We created a few chances. People should understand how difficult it is to attack 11 players [who are defending]. Thanks to the players, they are absolutely incredible.\n\"We demand a lot of the players without giving them the time to rest physiologically, that is why it is incredible. No matter what happens this season they deserve my admiration.\n\"We have competed in the Community Shield and the Carabao Cup, today we are leaders in the Premier League and we're in a good position in the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\"I have no complaints, no regrets. It's important that after what happened last season, we never give up, to do what we have done is incredible and today is a special moment.\n\"We compete in all competitions, playing every three days, no recovery, so you need a quality and depth of squad. When a team play with that spirit and desire with everybody committed, it doesn't matter. Hopefully they [injured players] can come back as soon as possible. Aymeric Laporte, we think, is getting better.\"\nBournemouth manger Eddie Howe speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is difficult - you want to be competitive and that was the way for us to make the game tight, show toughness and mentally hang in. The only frustration is their goal was ugly which is very unlike them, so very unlucky.\n\"It wasn't the plan to be so without the ball but they rarely make a mistake. Technically they were very good. You are waiting for a mistake so you can counter and they made very few. That limited the chance for us to do what we are very good at.\n\"Nathan Ake did very well today, the most experienced of the back three, led by example with his commitment and endeavour. With young Jack Simpson and Chris Mepham playing alongside him too, that is hugely positive for the future, looking at the age of these three. It is a good sign.\"\nMan City beat Bournemouth again - the stats\nManchester City's 100% record in eight games against Bournemouth is the best in English top-flight history.\nBournemouth have never beaten Manchester City in 14 previous league meetings (D2 L12).\nManchester City have kept a clean sheet in six of their past eight Premier League games, including in each of the past four, conceding just three goals in total.\nBournemouth failed to record a shot against Manchester City, the first time they have failed to register an attempt in a Premier League game.\nBournemouth recorded their lowest possession figure in a Premier League game against Manchester City (17.9%), with the club averaging 48.9% in the competition.\nManchester City's David Silva has provided an assist in each of his past three Premier League away games, as many as in his previous 19 on the road.\nFive of Riyad Mahrez's six Premier League goals for City have come away from home.\nWhat's next?\nNext up for Bournemouth is a trip to bottom side Huddersfield next Saturday (15:00 GMT). Manchester City host Watford the same day in the evening kick-off (17:30 GMT)."

Cardiff will hope the injury isn't as serious as first feared.\nWarnock will also feel Wolves' defender Ryan Bennett - who will serve a two-match suspension after picking up his 10th booking of the season - should have been shown a second yellow card following a challenge on his namesake Joe.\nOn this evidence, though, it is hard to see Cardiff hauling themselves out of trouble.\nThe Bluebirds face Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool in their next five games, before ending the campaign with a trip to Old Trafford.\nMan of the match - Raul Jimenez (Wolves)\nBennett 'should have been sent off' - what the managers said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo told Match of the Day: \"The first half was very good, but not so good in the second half.\n\"Cardiff unbalanced themselves with their direct game and we had superiority and could have done better. A 2-0 scoreline is not a comfortable result ever, especially against Cardiff because they are so tough. I am always afraid something will happen.\"\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock told Match of the Day: \"It has been the story of our season. We never gave ourselves a chance. The lads made mistakes they shouldn't have done and they know that.\"\nOn Sol Bamba's injury: \"It is disappointing and sums our season up. We will regroup, probably without Sol and go again next week.\"\nOn Ryan Bennett's foul: \"He should have been sent off, that is a booking anywhere else.\"\nTwelve wins and counting - the stats\nCardiff have lost five of their past seven Premier League matches (W2), conceding two or more goals in each defeat.\nWolves have lost just one of their past seven matches in the Premier League (W4 D2).\nDiogo Jota has been directly involved in nine goals in his past seven games in all competitions at Molineux (five goals, four assists).\nThere were just 134 seconds between Wolves' first and second goals against Cardiff.\nThere were 17 passes leading up to Diogo Jota's goal, the most passes before a Wolves goal in the Premier League this season.\nRyan Bennett (10) is one of three players to hit double figures for yellow cards in a single Premier League season for Wolves - after Paul Ince and Alex Rae in 2003-04.\nWolves' goalkeeper John Ruddy made his first start in the Premier League since May 2016 for Norwich versus Everton, 1,021 days ago.\nWhat's next?\nWolves travel to Chelsea in their next league fixture on Sunday, 10 March (14:05 GMT), while Cardiff host West Ham the day before (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-3 Crystal Palace\nCrystal Palace put in another superb away performance to win at relegation rivals Burnley and take another step towards securing their top-flight status.\nThe two sides went into the game level on 30 points and Palace made the early breakthrough as Jeffrey Schlupp's cut-back cannoned off Phil Bardsley's thigh into his own net.\nBurnley began to show their frustration towards the end of the first half and Michy Batshuayi doubled Palace's lead just after the break, sweeping in a low ball by fit-again full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\nPalace continued to keep it tight at the back while Wilfried Zaha grabbed the goal his work-rate and class deserved, tormenting the Burnley defence before firing low past Tom Heaton.\nAshley Barnes pulled one back late on while Burnley substitute Peter Crouch almost set up a nervy finish, but Palace held on to claim their third straight away game in all competitions.\nThe victory also lifted the Eagles up to 13th in the Premier League, putting eight points between themselves and the relegation zone, while Burnley dropped one place to 16th, five points clear of third-bottom Cardiff.\nRelive the action from Turf Moor\nPalace happy to hit the road\nNot only is Palace's away record better than at home this season but they have taken 20 points from a possible 33 on the road - a joint league-high of 61%.\nGiven Burnley enjoyed their longest-ever unbeaten run in the Premier League before losing at Newcastle in midweek, Palace were cautious in the first half, especially with Wan-Bissaka back after three games out while Scott Dann returned for his first league start since New Year's Day 2017.\nZaha, who was outstanding throughout, set up an early opener that allowed Palace to then sit back and pick off Burnley at will.\nThe Ivory Coast international beat left-back Charlie Taylor before firing a low ball across goal and Schlupp's cut-back went in off Bardsley.\nZaha's ability to run with the ball and hold off defenders allowed the visitors to relieve the pressure and frustrated the hosts, while Schlupp and Wan-Bissaka pushed up the wings more often as the game wore on.\nBatshuayi had been quiet in the first half but before Burnley had a chance to regroup after the break, Wan-Bissaka crossed for the on-loan Chelsea striker to sweep in a first-time strike and as Burnley pushed forward, Zaha took advantage.\nCheikhou Kouyate squared to Zaha just outside the Burnley box and the 26-year-old ran at Taylor and Ben Mee, twisting and turning inside the box, before firing in his fifth goal in five games.\nClarets rely on target men\nBurnley had given their chances of survival a boost with an eight-game unbeaten run and they were undaunted despite suffering an early setback, trying to play through their in-form strike pair of Barnes and Chris Wood.\nTheir best chance of the first half saw Jeff Hendrick pick out Barnes on the edge of the box and he touched the ball into the path of Wood, whose shot was blocked by returning Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.\nAfter the second goal, Burnley's front two combined again as Wood nodded a Jack Cork cross down for Barnes but his close-range shot was deflected over. The Clarets tended to rely on diagonal balls into the strikers rather than trying to get down the wings and behind the Palace defence.\nIn their desperation to get back in the game, the home side gave the ball away cheaply too often, leaving themselves exposed at the back, and they could even have gone 4-0 down as Patrick van Aanholt volleyed over.\nBut they salvaged some pride when Barnes scored with a glancing header from Ashley Westwood's cross and, just as the game moved into stoppage time, Crouch's low shot was turned round the far post by Hennessey.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\n'Most are probably confused Palace are down there' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said: \"We know they break quickly but at crucial times we got caught out. It's confusing when you look at the stats - they make it look like a good performance but we know stats don't win games.\n\"We're still looking at the next game, we know these games are important. Most people are probably confused, Palace are a good side and most people are probably scratching their heads when they see them down there [in the table].\n\"We've done a lot of work on this run, we've had tough results before and responded. The next game is important to get back to our levels of performance.\"\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson said: \"Sean has got the team very well disciplined, very well organised, and you know exactly what pressures you are going to be under. I thought we dealt with that extremely well throughout the game.\n\"By contrast, when we had the ball going forward I thought we looked pretty dangerous and the longer the game went on the more dangerous we got. To score three goals away from home against any team is a good performance, and to do it against a team of Burnley's calibre with their quality of defending is even more so.\n\"I'm delighted with the team's performance, and delighted it lifts us up that little bit higher in the table.\"\nBarnes and Zaha bang in form - the stats\nCrystal Palace have scored in nine consecutive Premier League games for the first time ever within a single season.\nMichy Batshuayi has scored five goals in his last seven starts in all competitions for English clubs.\nWilfried Zaha has had a hand in six goals in his last six Premier League games (5 goals, 1 assist), one more than he managed in his previous 21 (5).\nBurnley mustered 18 shots, their most in their last 38 Premier League games since managing 21 against Everton in March 2018.\nAshley Barnes has been directly involved in six goals in his last six Premier League appearances for Burnley, as many as he managed in his previous 25.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley visit Premier League title challengers Liverpool on Sunday, 10 March (12:00 GMT) while Palace host Brighton on Saturday, 9 March (12:30 GMT)."

We had many shots on target, we had possibilities but we lost because of a free-kick.\"\nMan of the match - Alireza Jahanbakhsh (Brighton)\nHuddersfield's unhappy hunting ground - the stats you may have missed\nBrighton are unbeaten in seven home league meetings with Huddersfield Town (W4 D3 L0) since a 2-3 defeat in League One in April 2011.\nBrighton's win ended a run of seven Premier League games without a victory (D2 L5).\nHuddersfield have lost 14 of their last 16 Premier League games (W1 D1).\nOnly Derby in 07-08 (14) scored fewer goals after 29 games of a Premier League season than Huddersfield in 2018-19 (15).\nAnthony Knockaert has registered two assists in his last three Premier League games for Brighton, after managing just one in his last 15 before that.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park at 12:30 GMT on Saturday, 9 March while Huddersfield host Bournemouth at 15:00 later on the same afternoon."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-0 Newcastle United: Declan Rice and Mark Noble goals earn Hammers victory\nFirst-half goals from Declan Rice and Mark Noble ensured West Ham eased to a deserved Premier League victory over Newcastle at London Stadium.\nRice headed in from a Robert Snodgrass corner to put the Hammers ahead after seven minutes.\nNoble then doubled the hosts' advantage from the penalty spot as the interval approached, following Newcastle defender Florian Lejeune's foul on Javier Hernandez.\nThe Magpies failed to offer much attacking threat, although Salomon Rondon did go close to grabbing a consolation as his free-kick struck Lukasz Fabianski's post.\nVictory for Manuel Pellegrini's side lifts them to ninth in the table, while Newcastle remain six points clear of the relegation places in 14th.\nWest Ham v Newcastle as it happened\nRice offers platform for Hammers' success\nDespite occupying a comfortable mid-table position in the Premier League, West Ham have struggled for consistency in Pellegrini's first season in charge.\nBut the Hammers produced a resolute performance in their narrow defeat by Manchester City in midweek and they used the same solid foundations to nullify Newcastle's attacking threat.\nRice, who last month pledged his international future to England, once again played a pivotal role for Pellegrini's side and was a disruptive nuisance to the visitors throughout.\nThe 20-year-old midfielder's clever movement in the penalty area left him free to pick his spot before powerfully heading beyond Martin Dubravka's reach, and an untroubled West Ham never appeared in danger of relinquishing their lead.\nNoble - who has now scored 19 of his last 21 league penalties - epitomised the Hammers' visible confidence in front of their home crowd and remained unfazed despite being forced to restart his run-up.\nRice, who made more tackles than any other player, and captain Noble refused Newcastle the time or space to build any rhythm, while Miguel Almiron and Ayoze Perez were kept on the periphery.\nIn an emotional tribute prior to kick-off, West Ham honoured club legend Billy Bonds - who made 799 appearances for the Hammers - with London Stadium's East Stand renamed in his honour.\nAside from the result, there was further positive news for manager Pellegrini as Manuel Lanzini completed the full 90 minutes on his first start for the club in 293 days following a long-term knee injury sustained in May last year.\n\"We are very happy, we played a good game and were a solid team. The way we attacked and tried to play as far from our box as possible, we played at a good level which is so important,\" said Pellegrini.\n\"Manuel Lanzini played for 90 minutes for the first time, my idea was for him to play for 65, 70 minutes but he was telling me that he was feeling good.\"\nNewcastle's surge for safety halted\nIn the build-up to Saturday's meeting with West Ham, manager Rafael Benitez warned his players they still have \"a lot of work to do\" in their battle to avoid relegation - despite taking four victories from their previous six in the league.\nBut Newcastle's surge toward safety hit a slight stumbling block as the Magpies missed the opportunity to open a gaping nine-point buffer between themselves and 18th-placed Cardiff.\nThe Magpies had been hitting their stride at precisely the right time in their bid to secure a third consecutive season in the top flight, but failed to maintain that momentum against determined opposition.\nRecord signing Almiron, impressive in his appearances for Benitez' side since his January move, was unable to influence the game as Newcastle failed to register a shot on target in the first half.\nRondon looked the most likely to bring his side back into the contest - yet even if his powerful free-kick had fallen the right side of the post it would likely have come too late.\nThe defensive solidarity of Benitez's side - which had helped them to back-to-back league clean sheets - was also lacking and Rice drifted in to punish the Magpies' slow start and lack of early concentration.\nBenitez said this week that his side could begin to enjoy their season once they secure \"38 or 40 points\" and, though they remain somewhat clear of trouble, his side will need to offer much more in their upcoming fixtures to avoid a nervy finish.\n\"We didn't start well, didn't do what we have to do at the start. We made our own mistakes, started with a lack of concentration and conceded two set-pieces to a good team,\" said Benitez.\n\"We are where are, we are doing a lot of good things but we must keep focus and concentration from first to last minute. We have to be sure we learn from these mistakes and prepare for the next game.\"\nMan of the match - Declan Rice (West Ham)\nMagpies don't enjoy London - the stats\nWest Ham United have completed the league double over Newcastle for the first time since the 1998-99 season.\nThe Hammers have lost just one of their last eight home Premier League games, and are unbeaten in their last five at London Stadium.\nNewcastle have lost 75 Premier League away games in London, more than any other side.\nThe Magpies have enjoyed just two wins in their last 17 away Premier League games and are without a victory on the road in six.\nWest Ham's Declan Rice has scored in two of his last four Premier League home games, after failing to score in his first 19.\nRobert Snodgrass has registered 19 assists in the league since the start of last season, a haul only bettered in English football's top four tiers by Marcus Maddison, Leroy Sane, Graham Carey and Raheem Sterling.\nWest Ham's Mark Noble has scored 22 penalties in the Premier League since his debut in August 2005. Only Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Sergio Aguero and Wayne Rooney have scored more in that period.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Everton in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while West Ham travel to face Cardiff at the same time."

        "article_text": "Watford 2-1 Leicester: Andre Gray's late goal sinks Leicester in Brendan Rodgers' first game in charge\nTroy Deeney insists there will be no Watford \"meltdown\" this season after the Hornets continued their impressive campaign with a late victory over Leicester in Brendan Rodgers' first game in charge of the Foxes.\nSecond-half substitute Andre Gray finished coolly past Kasper Schmeichel in injury time to lift the hosts level on points with seventh-placed Wolves.\nDeeney had given Watford an early lead, heading Gerard Deulofeu's cross past Schmeichel.\nJamie Vardy appeared to have earned the visitors a point with a low finish from Youri Tielemans' pass, but Gray's goal clinched the win for the Hornets.\nWatford won only one of their last nine league fixtures last season and suffered six consecutive defeats at the end of the 2016-17 campaign, but Deeney is confident Javi Gracia's side can maintain their push for a Europa League spot.\n\"We aren't happy to win just one and lose three,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we finish as high as we can. The media have said after January there will be a Watford meltdown.\n\"Egos are out of the window, everyone is trying. Look at the depth of the squad - everyone is willing to fight.\"\nWatford stay in eighth place due to their inferior goal difference to Wolves, while Leicester remain 11th following a seventh defeat in 10 league games.\nPositives for Rodgers?\nAfter watching Leicester's 2-1 win over Brighton from the stands on Tuesday, Rodgers promised his new charges that there are \"special things on the horizon\" at the club.\nRodgers shares his predecessor Claude Puel's penchant for promoting young talent, but it is his reputation for attractive, attacking football that has got Foxes fans dreaming of a brighter future.\nThe travelling supporters had little to shout about in the early stages though, as Watford took the game to their opponents from the outset.\nSchmeichel had to be on his toes to deny Adrian Mariappa after just three minutes, before Wes Morgan - named alongside Jonny Evans and Harry Maguire in City's back three - blocked Deulofeu's shot on the follow-up.\nRodgers will be disappointed with his team's defending for Deeney's opener, although replays suggested that Watford's top scorer was marginally offside from Deulofeu's delivery.\nThe Foxes improved as the game wore on, however, registering 14 attempts compared to Watford's six over the course of the 90 minutes.\nClear-cut opportunities were few and far between though until Vardy sprinted onto Tielemans' excellent through-ball and finished past Foster for his 10th goal of the campaign.\nVardy, 32, has now scored the first Premier League goal under each of Leicester's last four permanent managers - Claudio Ranieri, Craig Shakespeare, Puel and now Rodgers.\nWatford grind out win\nIf the Watford players' confidence was dented by the 5-0 defeat at Liverpool in midweek, they did not show it during an enterprising start to the contest.\nGracia's side could have taken the lead before Deeney's opener, but Mariappa and Deulofeu were denied by Schmeichel and Morgan respectively.\nDeeney and Deulofeu were excellent in the 5-1 win at Cardiff a week last Friday, and it was no surprise to see the duo combine for Watford's first goal.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure tested Schmeichel's reflexes in the second half with a powerful effort from outside the box, but the Dane had precious little else to do as Leicester's three-man defence of Morgan, Evans and Maguire stood firm.\nGray scored the only goal in Watford's previous home game against Everton, and the 27-year-old was on target for the Hornets once more with a confident finish that sparked wild celebrations among the home supporters.\nThis could prove to be an important three points for Gracia's side, who face both Manchester clubs away from home in their next two league outings.\nMan of the Match - Troy Deeney (Watford)\nHornets register 150th top-flight win - the stats\nWatford have now won three of their last four Premier League games (L1), as many victories as in their previous 15 games (P15 W3 D6 L6).\nLeicester City have now lost three Premier League matches thanks to a 90th-minute goal this season, more than any other side (also v Cardiff and Wolves).\nIn what was their 469th top-flight match, Watford's win was their 150thvictory. Indeed, the Hornets last recorded more than their 12 victories this season within a single top-flight campaign back in 1986-87 (18 wins).\nLeicester City have now conceded five Premier League goals inside the opening five minutes of matches this season, the joint-most in the division alongside Burnley.\nBoth Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu have scored three of Watford's last seven Premier League goals, with the duo directly combining for three of those strikes (one assist for Deeney, two for Deulofeu).\nOnly Sergio Aguero (10) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals in 2019 than Watford striker Troy Deeney (eight - five goals, three assists).\nWatford's Gerard Deulofeu has had a direct hand in 11 league goals this season (six goals, five assists); his highest ever tally in a single campaign within Europe's top five leagues.\nJamie Vardy has scored the first Premier League goal under each of Leicester's last four permanent managers (Ranieri, Shakespeare, Puel and Rodgers).\nBrendan Rodgers is the first Leicester City manager to lose their first Premier League match in charge of the club since Dave Bassett suffered defeat away at Chelsea back in October 2001.\n'I thought our play was excellent' - what the managers said\nWatford head coach Javi Gracia: \"In the first half we played much better than the second. We created chances to do it. In the second we lost possession and they had some chances. My players played really well and we deserved a good result.\n\"Andre Gray played some minutes against Everton and has scored important goals. We know he is always ready. I know all my players deserve more time but it is not easy to choose 11. What is more important for me is I know the players I choose are always ready.\n\"We are enjoying the season. It is an important amount of points for us but I can feel the players want more and more. Who knows what can happen in the future.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"I thought after going behind so early we regrouped and had some good moments. At half-time we reinforced about some issues around the speed of our game but I thought the play was excellent.\n\"It looked like only one team would win the game. When we had an opportunity it was a great pass from Youri [Tielemans] and Jamie [Vardy] does what he does. You felt Watford were getting deeper and the opportunities were coming for us.\n\"We started to get into really good areas and the goal at the end is a case of managing the game. It is something that will get better as we work together. I was pleased with the spirit of the team.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford face Manchester City at Etihad Stadium on Saturday, 9 March (17:30 GMT), while Leicester host struggling Fulham on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

This is the way Fulham play and the way I want my team to play.\n\"I am thinking long term in the best interests of Fulham. I will treat this as long term because I want to help this club.\"\nGonzalo Higuain set Chelsea on the way to a first Premier League away win of 2019 with a high-quality finish from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross.\nFulham equalised through Calum Chambers from a corner, awarded after recalled Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga produced an outstanding stop to keep out Aleksandar Mitrovic's volley.\nThey were level for only four minutes, Jorginho's well placed finish from 20 yards leaving Chelsea only two points adrift of fourth spot.\nRyan Sessegnon thought he had equalised in the closing moments but the 18-year-old's effort was ruled out for offside.\nKepa is a man and he understood his mistake - Sarri in forgiving mood\nReaction from Craven Cottage and the rest of Sunday's Premier League games\nBetter from Fulham but relegation looms\nDespite a 20th league defeat of the season, Fulham fans applauded the home side off the pitch at the end after a much improved performance.\nParker demanded a response in his first game and he got one, but time is running out for a team who have looked out of their depth most of the season.\nRelegation is looming for Fulham, whose run-in includes home matches against title-chasing Liverpool and Manchester City.\nIt might have been a different story but for Arrizabalaga.\nThe Chelsea keeper was kept busy with saves from Tom Cairney and Joe Bryan, but his acrobatic first-half stop to deny Mitrovic, with the score 1-0 to Chelsea, was outstanding.\nIt resulted in a corner from which Chambers, who was left totally unmarked, equalised. But Chelsea were soon level again.\nIn a frantic ending, Serbia forward Mitrovic could have equalised but headed straight at Arrizabalaga before Sessegnon put the ball in the back of the net only for a tight offside call to go against him.\nParker has described his new role as an \"audition\" and he certainly got a spirited reaction from his players. Now he has to find a way of turning decent performances into points.\nKepa back with a bang\nSeven days ago Chelsea were portrayed as a club in meltdown after goalkeeper Arrizabalaga refused to be substituted during the Carabao Cup final defeat by Manchester City.\nThe Spanish keeper was dropped for the midweek win against Tottenham but was back in the team at Fulham as Chelsea made it back-to-back wins in the league.\nWith the game goalless, Arrizabalaga was lucky to escape after dropping the ball at the feet of Ryan Babel on the edge of the six-yard area.\nBut he made up for his mistake with a wonderful save to deny Mitrovic before being let down by his defenders for Chambers' goal.\nChelsea were far from their fluent best and they wasted chances to put the game out of sight before Fulham's late rally.\nTowards the end of the first half, Higuain, who now has three goals in five league games for the club, missed a great opportunity to make it 3-1, before Fulham keeper Sergio Rico produced a sublime one-handed save to keep out the Argentine.\nWith Chelsea having a game in hand over the teams above them, the race to finish in a Champions League spot could yet go to the final weekend of the season.\nMan of the match - Kepa Arrizabalaga (Chelsea)\n'We were tired mentally and physically' - what they said\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri: \"We played very well only for 60 minutes. We could have killed the match.\n\"We were not able to so in the last 20 or 25 minutes we were in trouble because we were very tired mentally and physically after 120 minutes against Manchester City and a strong match against Tottenham.\n\"But I am really very happy with the performance for 60 minutes and the result.\"\nWhy Fulham don't like derbies - the stats\nFulham have become the first side to lose 10 London derbies in the top flight in a single season.\nChelsea are unbeaten in 18 Premier League games against Fulham.\nEden Hazard became the third Chelsea player to both score and assist 50 Premier League goals (81 goals, 50 assists) after Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.\nFulham midfielder Kevin McDonald has been on the winning side in just three of his 38 Premier League games (7.9%); among players to have played as many as 38 Premier League matches, only Rudy Gestede (3.9%, two wins in 51) has a lower win percentage.\nFulham have lost more matches than any other side in the top five European leagues in all competitions during 2019 (9).\nWhat's next?\nFulham are away to Leicester City in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Chelsea are in action on Thursday, when Dynamo Kiev visit Stamford Bridge in a Europa League last-16 first-leg tie (20:00 GMT)."

They got that and more.\nSilva waved his appreciation to Everton's fans at the final whistle and they certainly appreciated the good signs they saw.\nThe trick for Everton is to repeat this effort and application on a regular basis, not simply when presented with the opportunity to inflict some damage on Liverpool.\nThe occasional rousing of the spirits is not enough. Consistency must be found.\nThis performance, and result, was certainly enough to keep Silva and Everton's fans happy.\nMan of the match - Michael Keane (Everton)\n'The wind did not help - manager reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told Match of the Day: \"Situations like today you have to finish it off. To be successful in football you have to be stable and we were the better side today. The wind does not help and there was a lot today. We had five or six big chances but Jordan Pickford or defender was in between. I don't think they had a real chance. Not perfect but good enough, getting a point from Everton is always a success because it is our most difficult away game of the season.\n\"Who wants to be top of the table at beginning of March? It is nice but there are lots of games to play.\n\"I watched Match of the Day last night and saw the celebrations of Man City, they had 900 chances and scored one goal shot with the wrong foot. You have to be ready for these chances.\"\nEverton manager Marco Silva told Match of the Day: \"I'm proud of my players and the desire they showed.\n\"It felt amazing in our stadium. Our fans were amazing and they pushed the team from the first minute. It was a tough match but a balanced match.\n\"I told them before the Cardiff game that every match has to be a final for us. There are many games to play and many points to win before the end of the season. Nothing is finished for us.\"\nLiverpool's barren spell - the best stats\n34 of the 200 league meetings between Everton and Liverpool have finished goalless, 15 more 0-0s than any other fixture in English league history.\nLiverpool have failed to score in two of their past three Premier League games, having failed to find the net in just one of their previous 27 in the competition.\nThree of the past five Premier League meetings between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park have finished 0-0.\nLiverpool did not record a shot on target after Trent Alexander-Arnold's effort in the 54th minute.\nTwo of Everton's three shots on target came via their substitutes (one for Richarlison, one for Cenk Tosun).\nMohamed Salah has gone three Premier League games without a goal for the first time as a Liverpool player.\nLiverpool's Alisson has kept 17 clean sheets in the Premier League this season - the most by a keeper in their debut season in the competition since Pepe Reina in 2005-06 (20), also for Liverpool.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool could be four points behind Manchester City when they play their next game at home to Burnley on Sunday, 10 March (12:00 GMT kick-off), with City hosting Watford a day earlier.\nEverton travel to Newcastle on Saturday (15:00)."

My first impression was neither was going to get booked,\" said Hughton.\nFormer Palace forward Glenn Murray had given the Seagulls the lead with his 100th league goal, pouncing on a mistake by James Tomkins before superbly volleying into the far corner from 18 yards.\nBut the hosts equalised shortly after the break when Milivojevic scored his eighth penalty of the season after Davy Propper had fouled Andros Townsend.\nThe result leaves Brighton in 15th in the table, while Palace - who are also on 33 points - are in 14th.\nRelive Crystal Palace v Brighton\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nClinical Murray reaches landmark\nIt felt like the script was written for Brighton's Murray when Romania forward Florin Andone injured his thigh in the warm-up.\nHe was the only Brighton player to be applauded by the home supporters before kick-off - recognition of his 47 goals in five years as a Palace player.\nThe 35-year-old, who had scored for both teams in previous contests between them, had been stuck on 99 league goals since a double at Fulham at the end of January.\nAnd he made an inauspicious start to Saturday's game, touching the ball just three times in the opening 18 minutes as the hosts dominated possession.\nHowever, his fourth touch was clinical.\nChasing Lewis Dunk's long ball, he benefited from Tomkins' poor attempt to head clear before dispatching a brilliant effort from the left side of the Palace penalty area that gave keeper Vicente Guaita no chance.\nThe strike means Murray has become only the second Brighton player - after Tommy Cook - to reach 100 goals for the club.\n\"If Florin [Andone] plays then you don't know how he would have done, but Murray is someone used to this level of game and to see him back scoring is great,\" Hughton added.\n\"I don't know if 'bonus' is the right word but three points here, particularly with how the second half panned out, is a big win for us.\"\nPalace fail to recover again\nCrystal Palace dominated almost every statistic - with more territory, possession, shots and crosses than their opponents.\nHowever, Roy Hodgson's side once again struggled in the area that ultimately counts - scoring goals - against a solid Brighton side.\nPalace have managed just 11 goals in 15 league games at Selhurst Park this season, the second-worst scoring record at home in the Premier League after bottom club Huddersfield.\nAnd while they levelled thanks to Milivojevic's 17th penalty in two years, that was one of only three efforts on target, and Brighton keeper Mat Ryan dealt comfortably with an early Michy Batshuayi shot and a Tomkins header.\n\"It is a very disappointing day,\" Hodgson added. \"It was a poor performance in that we were not able to do enough with the amount of possession we had.\"\nPalace have a dismal record in games in which they have fallen behind this term, collecting just four points from a possible 42 - with their only victory coming at champions Manchester City in December.\nMan of the match - Dale Stephens (Brighton)\nPalace penalty kings - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won just one of their past seven home Premier League games (D2 L4) and have earned the lowest proportion of their points at home in the competition this season (39% - 13/33).\nBrighton have done the league double over Palace for the first time since 1983-84 when the teams were in the second tier.\nSince the start of last season, the Eagles have been awarded 19 penalties in the Premier League, six more than any other side.\nSince their promotion to the top flight for the 2017-18 season, Brighton have conceded 12 penalties in the competition - a joint high with Arsenal.\nBrighton winger Anthony Knockaert's yellow card after 28 seconds was the quickest in the Premier League since Stephen Warnock was booked on 26 seconds for Blackburn against Hull in March 2009.\nKnockaert's goal for Brighton was their first from outside the box in the Premier League since February 2018, when Pascal Gross netted against West Ham.\nStriker Glenn Murray has scored in his past four appearances for Brighton against Crystal Palace.\nMurray has scored 35% of the Seagulls' Premier League goals (23 of 66), the highest proportion of any team's goals by a player in the history of the competition.\nSince his debut in February 2017, Luka Milivojevic has scored 21 Premier League goals for Crystal Palace, more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace visit Premier League rivals Watford in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday, 16 March (12:15 GMT kick-off).

        "article_text": "Newcastle 3-2 Everton: 'Ayoze Perez's winner was offside' - Toffees boss Marco Silva\nNewcastle stormed back from two goals down at half-time to beat Everton in a captivating match, leaving Toffees boss Marco Silva angry Ayoze Perez's winner was not disallowed for offside.\nPerez capped a stellar performance by whipping the ball past Jordan Pickford in the 84th minute after the Everton defence failed to react to Isaac Hayden's lofted pass back into the box.\nThe Spaniard had retreated from a clear offside position but only touched the ball after Salomon Rondon - although replays appeared to show Rondon was slightly offside when the ball was played in.\n\"When they scored the third goal it was a big mistake by the assistant - it was a clear offside,\" said Silva, who confronted referee Lee Mason on the pitch after the game.\n\"If you see the image it's not just one or two players in offside positions, there were five Newcastle players in the same line in offside positions.\n\"If 2-2 for us at that moment was a big frustration, imagine when they scored the third goal in a clear offside position?\"\nPerez had levelled three minutes earlier when Pickford spilled Miguel Almiron's stinging drive into his path, while he also set up Rondon's fine volley to get the hosts back into the game.\nUntil then, Rafael Benitez's side had felt aggrieved at Mason's decision not to send Pickford off for a foul on Rondon, with the England goalkeeper saving Matt Ritchie's poor subsequent penalty.\nMoments after that save, Richarlison tapped in his side's second after Martin Dubravka parried Andres Gomes' low cross straight to the Everton winger.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin got the opener on 18 minutes with a fine glancing header from Lucas Digne's superb cross.\nBut the Toffees faded badly in the face of Newcastle's second-half onslaught and are now only three points in front of Benitez's side, with Silva admitting his side \"have to look at ourselves\".\n\"We lost because it was our fault,\" he said.\n\"Because I'm sure if we had kept doing what we did in the first half and we did what we had to do in the first 15 minutes of the second half, we would have killed the match with a third goal.\"\nRelive Newcastle's stunning comeback\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday\nPerez inspires stirring comeback\nWhile unlucky and understandably frustrated to be 2-0 down at the interval, Newcastle were sloppy in the first half, not least when Ritchie stuttered in his run-up and hit a tame penalty down the middle that Pickford saved with his legs.\nBenitez replaced captain Jamaal Lascelles, who had a knee injury, with Paul Dummett at half-time and later changed the shape of his side - moving Dummett to left back and pushing Ritchie up from there to right midfield, which allowed Newcastle to be more direct against a shaky Everton defence.\nThat defensive frailty was exposed on 65 minutes when Hayden played a hopeful pass up to Perez, who had only Rondon in support against four Everton defenders.\nBut Perez won the header back to Rondon, spun and received the return pass before deftly chipping to the Venezuela striker to volley beyond Pickford from 12 yards.\n\"The first goal was a great goal - I was joking that if Lionel Messi had done what Ayo did and Alan Shearer finished like Rondon, everybody would have been talking for a month about that,\" said Benitez.\nDummett looped a header over when Rondon was better placed behind him but Newcastle kept coming and drew level on 81 minutes as Almiron struck from 30 yards and Perez slotted in the rebound after Pickford failed to push it wide.\nFrustration had given way to fervent urgency and Everton wilted, their defence caught static as Rondon brought down Hayden's lofted pass and Perez stabbed in the winner.\nNow it was Everton's turn to feel aggrieved, but the visitors will still be alarmed at the manner of their collapse.\nPickford's dreadful day\nShortly after the break, former Sunderland player Pickford smiled and stuck his tongue out at the Newcastle fans, who booed his every touch, but it ended up a miserable, chastening day for the England keeper.\nHe should have been dismissed after half an hour when he spilled Ritchie's cross into Rondon's path and took a step to his left to tackle the Newcastle striker.\nMason likely decided that Pickford's foul in denying a goalscoring opportunity was accidental or he was trying to play the ball, which, since 2016, does not result in a red card. But Pickford looked to have deliberately impeded Rondon and it was strange Mason did not at least book him.\nWhile Pickford saved the penalty and also denied Perez and Dummett with fine stops, those moments were overshadowed by a volatile and nervy showing.\nHe looked uncertain when coming for crosses, often punching instead of catching, was beaten by Rondon to a ball over the top that the striker poked just wide and could not handle Almiron's strike to gift Perez.\nWith the England squad named on Wednesday, this was a performance that may alarm manager Gareth Southgate when he considers who is his first-choice keeper.\nMan of the match - Ayoze Perez (Newcastle)\n'We believed we could do it' - reaction\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We didn't deserve to be losing 2-0 but you have to react and at half-time we talked about staying calm - it was really difficult to keep the players calm but they understood that that was the way.\n\"To concede one minute after missing a penalty is the worst nightmare for any manager but we reacted well. The players were pushing and pushing and they had the belief and confidence we could do it.\n\"We have more confidence but we have to keep winning.\"\nEverton manager Marco Silva, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We didn't expect what happened, but it's football.\n\"Even in the first 15 to 20 minutes in the second half we had counter-attacks - we had to kill the game in that moment.\n\"I cannot understand - five Newcastle players were in the same line and Rondon was offside.\"\n'Pickford got wrapped up in the emotion' - analysis\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright on BBC MOTD:\n\"Jordan Pickford had an erratic game. He got too wrapped up in the emotion of Sunderland versus Newcastle with the home crowd.\n\"How he didn't get sent off for the foul on Salomon Rondon is terrible. It was a deliberate attempt to take the man out and there is absolutely no double jeopardy there.\n\"He was gesturing to the Newcastle fans behind the goal but he should've been focusing on the game. He parries the ball back into the danger area far too often and it led to Newcastle's equaliser.\"\nNewcastle's biggest league comeback for 16 years - match stats\nNewcastle United won a Premier League game from two goals down for the first time since October 2003 against Fulham under Sir Bobby Robson.\nEverton lost an away Premier League match having led by two goals for only the second time, also doing so in September 2000 away at Tottenham.\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has saved three of the last four penalties he has faced in the Premier League.\nNewcastle United have failed to score with three of their last four Premier League penalties, with three different players seeing their penalties saved (Joselu, Kenedy and Matt Ritchie).\nSalomon Rondon has been involved in 13 Premier League goals for Newcastle United this season - five more than any other player (eight goals, five assists).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, 16 March at 15:00 GMT.\nEverton host Chelsea at 16:30 on Sunday, 17 March."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 0-2 Bournemouth: Wilson scores on injury return\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe praised Callum Wilson as a \"unique player\" after the striker scored on his return from injury in the Cherries' win at Huddersfield.\nWilson, who had been sidelined since January with a knee problem, forced home Ryan Fraser's cross to put the Cherries ahead in the first half.\nThe same duo combined for Bournemouth's second goal after the break, with Wilson crossing for Fraser to sweep home his sixth Premier League goal of the season and secure the south coast side's first away win since October.\n\"Callum Wilson is a unique player, he has the ability to run in behind, he is strong, powerful, he took his goal really well, and the most impressive thing was his assist for Ryan [Fraser],\" Howe told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"Behind the scenes he has done a lot of work and I had no doubt he could play for a long time, but even I was surprised it was 90 minutes, but that shows how professional he is.\"\nBournemouth stay 12th despite the win but are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Huddersfield, meanwhile, remain bottom and are now 16 points from safety, with relegation now looking all but certain.\nJoshua King could have extended Bournemouth's lead, but his shot from outside the area was well blocked by Jonas Lossl.\nThe Norwegian then failed to scramble the ball over the line after Nathan Ake's header was cleared into his path by Mathias Jorgensen.\nHuddersfield, looking to secure back-to-back home wins for the first time since November 2017, were full of effort but their lack of killer instinct again let them down.\nThey matched their opponents in managing eight efforts at goal, but only one of those was on target - a tame first-half shot by Steve Mounie that was easily saved by Artur Boruc.\nRelive Huddersfield v Bournemouth as it happened\nAll of Saturday's Premier League reaction\nWilson impresses in front of Southgate\nWith England manager Gareth Southgate watching in the stands, Wilson could not have picked a better time to return to the Bournemouth line-up.\nSouthgate names his squad on Wednesday for European Championship qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Montenegro later this month, and Wilson, who scored on his England debut in November, certainly made a strong case for inclusion.\nThe 27-year-old showed few signs of rustiness despite this being his first appearance since 19 January.\nHis return also seemed to bring the best out of Bournemouth's other attacking players, with King, Fraser and David Brooks all impressing.\nWilson had already seen an early effort well blocked by Huddersfield keeper Lossl by the time he escaped his marker at the far post to chest home Fraser's cross for the opener, his 50th league goal for the club in his 138th appearance.\nHe then showed great awareness for Bournemouth's second, opting not to shoot after running on to King's pass and instead laying it across for the unmarked Fraser to score.\n\"For anyone coming back from injury you want to make an impact and it was nice to get a goal and an assist and three points for the team,\" Wilson told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"From past games you have confidence you will score, I will get a chance and thankfully I could be clinical and take the chance today. We let them off the hook with only scoring the two really.\"\nWhen asked about the watching Southgate, Wilson added: \"When you focus on club performance, hopefully I can get the recognition internationally.\"\nManager Howe said before the game that he was \"desperate\" for his side to end their woeful away run of nine successive defeats, stretching back to a 3-0 victory at Fulham on 27 October.\nThe Cherries conceded at least two goals in each of those nine games, so Howe is also likely to be impressed with the way his side saw the game out with a clean sheet, with Ake once again dominant in the heart of their defence.\nThe only negatives on an otherwise comfortable afternoon were injuries to Adam Smith and Brooks, although the latter's substitution meant a return to action for January signing Dominic Solanke for the first time in over a month.\nNo end product for Huddersfield\nA 22nd Premier League defeat of the season all but ends Huddersfield's chances of avoiding relegation, with head coach Jan Siewert calling the performance \"unacceptable\".\nThe German, who has now lost five of his six games in charge, admitted beforehand that this was a \"must win\" if the Terriers were to avoid the drop.\nThe Yorkshire club beat Wolves in their last game at the John Smith's Stadium, but never looked like threatening a repeat here.\n\"Not a good feeling at all. I am sorry for everyone who came here because this is not the football I can play with this team. We were unacceptable,\" Siewert told BBC Match of the Day. \"I don't know why it is, talk to the players.\n\"There was no conversation. After the game I looked at the goals, saw what happened and I will talk to them tomorrow morning.\"\nThere is no doubting the effort and commitment of the players, but their lack of cutting edge in front of goal once again proved costly.\nSiewert's gameplan was to cross the ball from wide areas and try to utilise the height of strikers Steve Mounie and Elias Kachunga.\nThey managed 25 crosses from open play and forced six corners, but never truly tested Boruc in the Bournemouth goal.\nAn early effort came from an Aaron Mooy free-kick, but Boruc was able to punch clear unchallenged.\nSubstitute Chris Lowe also momentarily caused panic when Boruc missed his cross from the left at the start of the second half, but Charlie Daniels was well-placed to clear.\nOnly two teams in top-flight history have scored fewer goals after 30 games than the 15 Huddersfield have notched up this season.\nWith just 10 games remaining and 16 points between themselves and 17th-placed Burnley, it would take a truly great escape for Huddersfield to avoid a return to the Championship.\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson (Bournemouth)\n'I will fight for this club' - what they said\nHuddersfield Town manager Jan Siewert speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We tried in the second half, we were closer to my football and the way I am going to play like in the Wolves game. I will fight for the club, when we had the possibility to go for the equaliser they scored and it killed the game.\n\"It is a difficult situation and I knew that when I came in. I am a young manager, they haven't scored that much this season still but we had two goals and a win against Wolves and we have to continue like that. I will still keep fighting for this club.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We were very good today, we had our bounce back and a lot of quality. We could have scored more but the goals we scored were of the highest quality.\n\"The away form was becoming something we were desperate to stop talking about and we are delighted we could do it today. The players coming back from injury helped and I was very pleased with our performance and the goals.\n\"We took a bit of stick against Manchester City for the way we set up but we defended well and took that into this game. There were really good signs for Chris Mepham in the future who was brilliant today.\"\nGoalscorer Ryan Fraser speaking to the Premier League: \"When he [Wilson] was injured I was saying, 'When you back? When you back?' And he would say, 'Three weeks', and then, 'Two weeks', and I was thinking, come on! When you play with the talent he has, it brings the best out of everyone in the team. It shows he was a big miss for us.\n\"We knew they would have the ball and sometimes we are the best on the counter-attack. We have the players to do it and today was a good team defensive performance and a clean sheet as well.\n\"We have always been looking up the table, our aim is to try and get seventh, we know we have hard games coming up but if we focus and work hard we can do it.\"\nWilson scores against Huddersfield again - the stats\nOnly two teams in top-flight history have scored fewer goals after 30 games than the 15 Huddersfield have this season - Leicester City (13 in 1977-78) and Derby County (14 in 2007-08).\nBournemouth have ended a run of nine consecutive Premier League away defeats.\nCallum Wilson netted his 50th league goal for Bournemouth in his 128th appearance.\nWilson has netted seven goals in six games against Huddersfield in the league, his best return against any side.\nRyan Fraser is the first Scottish player to register 10 assists in a single Premier League season.\nOnly Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard (11 each) have registered more assists in Europe's 'big five' leagues this season than Fraser (10, level with Jadon Sancho and Joshua Kimmich).\nWilson and Fraser have combined for nine Premier League goals this season (Wilson has set up four for Fraser, and Fraser has set up five for Wilson), more than any other duo in the competition in 2018-19.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield travel to the London Stadium to take on West Ham on Saturday, 16 March (15:00 GMT). Bournemouth are at home to Newcastle at the same time."

        "article_text": "Southampton 2-1 Tottenham: Saints battle back to stun Spurs\nTwo late goals in five minutes earned Southampton an incredible victory against Tottenham, whose top-four hopes took a nosedive.\nJames Ward-Prowse earned the win with a sensational free-kick from 25 yards to keep the Saints two points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\nThe midfielder's strike came after calamitous defending allowed Southampton to draw level via Yan Valery, who pounced on Danny Rose's mistake.\nVictory seemed unlikely after a first half dominated by Spurs who took the lead when Harry Kane scored his 200th career goal.\nBut the amazing turnaround earned Ralph Hasenhuttl's team a second consecutive home win - the first time Southampton have achieved that since December 2016.\nTottenham, whose manager Mauricio Pochettino was in the stands as part of his two-match touchline ban, remain third but, after losing a third league game in four, they now face the prospect of being caught by their rivals.\nManchester United, who were 13 points behind Spurs when Jose Mourinho was sacked as manager on 16 December, can move level on points with Spurs should they beat Arsenal on Sunday.\nAnd if Chelsea win their two games in hand, they will go above Tottenham, who have already reached the last eight of this year's Champions League, but face second-place Liverpool in their next game.\nTottenham arrogant in a bad way - Pochettino\nHasenhuttl revels in crucial win\nAt the final whistle, Hasenhuttl joined his team for a huddle on the pitch as they celebrated their first comeback victory of the season.\nNo team has dropped more points from winning positions this term, underlined by a 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford last Saturday, where they had led 1-0 and drew level with a Ward-Prowse free-kick.\nBut this time, the Saints midfielder's strike proved crucial as he scored a sixth goal in nine appearances to lift Southampton up to 16th in the table - above Burnley, who face Liverpool on Sunday.\nCredit must also go to midfielder Josh Sims, who, after his half-time introduction, played a pivotal role in turning around the game after Saints' poor first half.\nThe home win was also a first over Tottenham since 2005, but more important was the lift it will give Hasenhuttl's side at such an important stage of the season.\nTottenham implode as Pochettino watches from stands\nPochettino was cast as a bystander as he returned to his former employers and watched his team unravel from the stands.\nThat was in contrast to the first period when the visitors hit the woodwork twice before Kane's opener, after Maya Yoshida fired against his own post and Christian Eriksen clipped the bar with a free-kick.\nDele Alli, who returned to the side after a seven-week injury absence, was a constant threat and set up Kane's 24th goal of the season.\nPart of the turnaround was because of Southampton's extra impetus, provided by the excellent Sims, making his first appearance of the season after being on loan at Reading, and Shane Long, who also came on at the break but was taken off injured.\nBut Rose's decision to let the ball through his legs close to goal handed the hosts a welcome boost.\nAnd they never looked back as Stuart Armstrong strode forward in search of a winner only to be tripped by Kyle Walker-Peters, who was perhaps fortunate to only receive a yellow card.\nThat looked like a let-off, but with Ward-Prowse deadly from 25 yards out, he still made Spurs pay.\nThe 24-year-old, who has earned a solitary England cap - against Germany in 2017 - could not have timed his form any better as Gareth Southgate gets set to announce his squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Montenegro later this month.\nMan of the match - Josh Sims\nThis is our reality - Pochettino\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It is so difficult to understand why we changed so much from the first half to the second.\n\"The second half, we did not take it seriously, I don't want to criticise too much but when you lose a game that was under control after 45 minutes - we should be 3-0, 4-0 - and finishes in 2-1 defeat, it is difficult to accept.\n\"Their first goal was a cross in front of the goal where four players can put the ball out of the stadium.\n\"This is our reality. People talk about perceptions but we need to realise if you do not fight with intensity for the Champions League, you will struggle. We are fighting against big sides. We had a big gap, welcome to the reality, we are under pressure to win games. It is a massive challenge for us.\"\nSaints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"We were only 1-0 down but with the two changes at half-time we had more speed and forced them into more mistakes. We had more pressure on the counter press and they got a little bit nervous. They tried to play football but it did not work like the first half. The two goals were fantastic.\n\"What a massive free-kick from James Ward-Prowse, the keeper had no chance. You know he is dangerous and has a big chance to score.\n\"We have a lot of players on loan and Josh Sims is back and did not have a chance to show me. He deserved to play and I am very happy he grabbed the chance with both hands.\n\"The opponents are always winning but this is only a step. It is a big win for us and we have a three weeks' break, it is a completely different feeling above the relegation line. We need more wins in the last eight games.\"\n'Spurs lacked respect for the game' - analysis\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas on BBC MOTD:\n\"I just think it was odd that they couldn't expect that Southampton would come out [for the second half] a better side.\n\"They were so poor in the first half. The amount of respect they gave Tottenham - it was almost like a training game.\n\"In the second half, I did feel [Spurs] lacked the respect that was needed for the moment of the season, for the game. Southampton were brilliant.\n\"They didn't wake up, they didn't smell it and they didn't sense it.\n\"The defending [for the equaliser] is ridiculous. It's comical to be defending like that in such a pivotal moment in the game.\"\nWhat next?\nAfter a break for the FA Cup quarter-finals next weekend, Southampton face south-coast rivals Brighton in their next Premier League game on 30 March while Tottenham travel to Liverpool the following day.\nBest of the stats\nSpurs have lost three consecutive away games in the Premier League for just the second time under Mauricio Pochettino, previously doing so in November 2017.\nSouthampton have now won twice against 'big six' opposition in the Premier League at home under Ralph Hasenhuttl (three games) - they didn't manage any wins against them under Claude Puel, Mauricio Pellegrino and Mark Hughes combined (14 games).\nHarry Kane's 200 career goals feature 180 at club level and 20 for England.\nHarry Kane has netted in each of his last five Premier League appearances against Southampton for Spurs (seven goals), including in each of the three games at St. Mary's in this run."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 2-0 West Ham: Gritty Bluebirds beat Hammers\nCardiff City produced a big performance at the right time as they put pressure on their relegation rivals with a vital home victory over a lacklustre West Ham.\nThe Bluebirds made a perfect start when Junior Hoilett swept home a fine move after just four minutes thanks to some questionable Hammers defending.\nThey doubled their advantage seven minutes after half time with Victor Camarasa bundling the ball home, and the Bluebirds might have added to that advantage in their most dominant home display of the season.\nDeclan Rice hit the post for the Hammers with 20 minutes remaining, but Manuel Pellegrini's side never truly looked capable of mounting a comeback, even when Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge denied Marko Arnautovic.\nRelive Cardiff 2-0 West Ham\nLive reaction from this afternoon's Premier League games\nBluebirds boost their survival hopes\nFor Cardiff, there was a sense that this represented a must win occasion, with the Bluebirds' form having turned dramatically recently at the worst possible time.\nWins over Bournemouth and Southampton had taken Cardiff clear of the relegation zone, but they came into this one on the back of three defeats in succession with an aggregate score of 10-1 and having lost their most important defender, Sol Bamba, to a season-ending knee injury.\nThe Bluebirds do not play for three weeks now and three of their next four matches are against sides in the top six, just adding to the feeling that they had to win this one.\nAnd they made exactly the start they would have hoped for, taking the lead via a fine driving run from Camarasa following his long injury lay-off. His clever ball allowed Josh Murphy to cross and Hoilett was able to hook the ball home at the near post as West Ham's defenders stood statuesque around him.\nManager Neil Warnock would scarcely have believed how comfortably his side were able to keep their advantage in a first period of very few chances.\nWhen West Ham did eventually fashion an opening, striker Javier Hernandez was booked for simulation after Bruno Manga's challenge - a rather apt summary of a toothless first half display.\nCity started the second half strongly, with Harry Arter shooting wide, and it was no surprise that they doubled their lead on 52 minutes with the same three players involved again.\nThis time Hoilett and Murphy were the providers. Hoilett crossed, Murphy headed back across the goal and Camarasa was on hand to beat Lukasz Fabianski to the loose ball and bundle home.\nOumar Niasse could have killed the contest when Aron Gunnarsson robbed Manuel Lanzini to send him clean through, but he missed the target.\nFabianski also denied Cardiff with a super double save from Niasse and Camarasa's follow-up.\nWest Ham consistently inconsistent\nThe Hammers continue to be a hard team to predict, with their form fluctuating in an inconsistent campaign.\nPellegrini's side came into this one on the back of two wins from three and having been arguably unlucky in defeat at Manchester City. But before that, they had won only one in seven.\nThe Hammers' recent problems have been on the road, where they have lost four of their last five, having failed to score in any of those defeats.\nAnd it was 39 minutes until the Hammers managed a shot at the Cardiff City Stadium, with Mark Noble's speculative 50-yard effort easy for Etheridge to collect.\nA better chance came the way of Robert Snodgrass on the stroke of half-time, but he fired over.\nSo toothless were the Hammers that it was no surprise to see top scorer Arnautovic introduced for the second half, as the Austrian has been involved in 10 goals in his last 11 league games against newly-promoted sides.\nHowever, Cardiff were no less dominant after the break, with West Ham failing to test the Bluebirds' defence until the 70th minute, when Rice's 20-yard shot struck the base of the post.\nArnautovic shot firmly shortly afterwards but was denied by Etheridge as City held firm, with the Hammers' spirited final 20 minutes a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted.\nMan of the match - Victor Camarasa (Cardiff)\n'We raised our level' - what they said\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock, speaking to BBC MOTD: \"There were talks about a split camp, but we saw the team spirit today. It's probably as good as we've played this season, against a good side. We played some good stuff today and [kept] an eighth clean sheet too.\n\"We had to stand up and be counted because nobody is going to help us. We were solid at the back and brilliant in midfield and we were a threat up front too.\"\nCardiff midfielder Harry Arter: \"We outworked them and we had a lot of quality on the ball. We raised our level of performance today. We put things right on the pitch after a hard week in training.\n\"Everything we've done this season has been fighting until the end, until the last three games. It's always been a united dressing room. There's been no rift in this squad.\"\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"It was a disappointing result and performance. We need to look at what we're doing away - in our last four away games we haven't scored a goal. Today it was a very disappointing performance.\n\"We need to improve - we need to see what we're doing wrong away. It's unacceptable to play four games away and not score one goal.\"\nWest Ham's away struggles continue - the stats\nCardiff secured their first-ever win against West Ham in the Premier League after losing each of the previous three meetings by a two-goal margin.\nWest Ham are without a win in six away Premier League games (D1 L5), after winning each of the three before that.\nWest Ham have only won one of their last nine Premier League away games against sides starting the day in the relegation zone (D4 L4).\nCardiff went in ahead at half-time for only the second time this season in the Premier League.\nCardiff kept their eighth Premier League clean sheet of the season, more than Manchester United (7) and Arsenal (5) have managed.\nJunior Hoilett has netted 16 goals for Cardiff in all competitions since Neil Warnock took over in October 2016, a haul bettered only by Kenneth Zohore (22).\nJunior Hoilett's opener for Cardiff was timed at 3 minutes and 37 seconds, the Bluebirds' fastest league goal since February 2018, when Hoilett himself netted against Millwall (3:00).\nWhat's next?\nThe Bluebirds face a three-week break before they face Chelsea at the Cardiff City Stadium on Sunday, 31 March (14:05 GMT). Meanwhile, West Ham are back in action next Saturday, 9 March, when they host Huddersfield (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Leicester 3-1 Fulham: Jamie Vardy double earns Brendan Rodgers first win\nBrendan Rodgers secured his first win as Leicester City manager to push Fulham closer to relegation, as Jamie Vardy reached a century of goals for the Foxes.\nRodgers - who started with a defeat at Watford after his switch from Celtic - was afforded a warm reception from fans at the King Power Stadium before kick-off and they were able to celebrate with a victory.\nVardy was the key figure throughout, unselfishly setting up a simple first-half finish for Youri Tielemans before rising to the occasion after substitute Floyd Ayite's scrappy equaliser for the Cottagers after the break.\nHe raced on to James Maddison's perfect through ball to put Leicester back in front with 12 minutes left, then got his 100th goal for the club when he turned a finish past Sergio Rico after 86 minutes.\nFulham, under the interim management of Scott Parker, had no answer and this is a defeat that leaves them cut adrift from safety and surely on their way back into the Championship after just one season in the top flight.\nRelive Leicester's win over Fulham\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League fixtures\nVardy shows importance\nVardy's relationship with Claude Puel was always a bone of contention before the Frenchman's sacking - but he has demonstrated his continued importance in the first two games of the Rodgers era.\nVardy and Puel always seemed ill at ease and it looked like the coach never fully trusted the former England striker in his preferred style.\nHere, and indeed when he scored in Rodgers' first game at Watford, Vardy has made the sort of impact that means he will figure prominently as the new manager formulates his early plans.\nAnother stylish performer was Belgium midfielder Youri Tielemans, on loan from Monaco, and he is the sort of player Rodgers relishes having.\nThe 21-year-old ran the show in the first half, not just scoring a relatively simple goal but demonstrating the sort of vision that will make him a hot property whether he stays at Leicester or not.\nRodgers was beaming at the final whistle, delighted to get those first three points on the board.\nThe Cottagers on the way down\nFulham's fate is surely sealed after this latest defeat - 13 points from safety and 11 behind Cardiff City above them after the Bluebirds' home win over West Ham.\nAnd performances like that produced in the first half on Saturday are why they are where they are - players strolling around without any urgency, seemingly oblivious to the seriousness of their position.\nAyite's equaliser prompted a show of fight, but in the end cheap goals were conceded and relegation is the price they will pay.\nThis cannot be put at Parker's door. The damage was done in a summer of scattergun recruitment, then poor results under Slavisa Jokanovic and Claudio Ranieri.\nIt is now merely a question of when their return to the Championship is confirmed - and then it is a question of whether Parker is given the full-time task of rediscovering a club who have lost their way.\nVardy matches Lineker - the stats\nVardy scored his 100th goal for Leicester in all competitions, becoming the first player to achieve that feat for the Foxes since Gary Lineker.\nVardy has scored 74 Premier League goals - since the start of the 2014-15 season, only Harry Kane (122), Sergio Aguero (109) and Romelu Lukaku (81) have scored more.\nSince the start of the 2014-15 season, only Riyad Mahrez (27) has assisted more Premier League goals for Leicester than Vardy (24).\nThree of Maddison's past four Premier League assists for Leicester have been provided for Vardy.\nFulham have lost 14 of their 16 Premier League away matches this season (W0 D2 L14), conceding 40 goals.\nLeicester manager Rodgers has won all seven of his Premier League matches against Fulham, the joint-best 100% record in the competition's history for a manager against one opponent (also Jose Mourinho v Portsmouth and Roberto Mancini v Wigan Athletic).\nThe Cottagers have lost their past 18 away top-flight matches when they have conceded the first goal.\nFulham's Ayite became only the second Togolese player to score a Premier League goal, after Emmanuel Adebayor (97 goals between 2006 and 2016).\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nRodgers praises 'world-class' Vardy - what the managers said\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers: \"The first goal typifies the unselfishness of Jamie Vardy. He squared the ball to Youri Tielemans when he was on the brink of his 100th goal - that tells you everything about the player he is.\n\"All of a sudden they got to 1-1 and it gives them a little bit of momentum, but huge credit to the boys [for their reaction].\"\nOn Vardy: \"He's showed over the past couple of years that he's a world-class striker. I'm just really glad that he's here. He's a brilliant focal point for the team.\"\nFulham manager Scott Parker: \"Individual errors have cost us the game and have been a massive part of this year.\n\"It's going to be really, really tough. I sit here with realism. I understand the situation. I'm not blinded by that.\n\"The message remains that as long as it's mathematically possible we fight - but we know it's going to be really tough.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Burnley on Saturday, 16 March (15:00 GMT), while Fulham welcome Liverpool to Craven Cottage the following day (14:15 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Man City 3-1 Watford: Sterling hat-trick lifts leaders clear of Liverpool\nRaheem Sterling's quick-fire second-half hat-trick sent Manchester City four points clear at the top of the Premier League, but there was controversy over the opener that broke down a stubborn Watford side.\nWith the game goalless at the start of the second half, Sterling was challenged by Daryl Janmaat as he ran on to Sergio Aguero's flick and the ball cannoned off him and into the net.\nSterling was clearly offside when Aguero chested the ball into his path and the lineman's flag went up. But, after a long discussion with his fellow official, referee Paul Tierney overruled his decision, to the disbelief of the Hornets players.\nThere was no disputing the legality of Sterling's second goal, which came only four minutes later when he tapped in Riyad Mahrez's cross at the far post after a flowing City move.\nAnd, just before the hour mark, the 24-year-old England forward made it 3-0, running on to a David Silva pass and cutting past two defenders before slotting home his 18th goal of the season.\nWatford, who had made seven changes ahead of their FA Cup quarter-final with Crystal Palace next weekend, belatedly threw on Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu - two of those to be left out.\nThe pair combined seconds later to pull a goal back with their first touches when Deeney flicked on a long ball for Deulofeu to fire home with his side's first shot, after 66 minutes.\nIt proved to be only a consolation rather than the start of an unlikely comeback, with City comfortably holding on to clinch their sixth successive league win.\nTheir four-point lead is their biggest advantage at the top since 4 December, although Liverpool can cut the gap when they host Burnley on Sunday.\nCity keep focused and keep winning\nIt has been a difficult week for the defending champions, with Uefa and the Premier League joining Fifa and the Football Association in launching separate investigations into their financial affairs and academy recruitment.\nBut if those issues, along with seemingly outlandish claims from Italy that Pep Guardiola has agreed to take charge of Juventus next season, are distracting the Blues players as they chase an unprecedented quadruple, then they did not show it here.\nFor the third successive game, they faced a side hell-bent on stopping them scoring rather than showing any ambition themselves, but City kept at their task and eventually made the breakthrough.\nGuardiola says it is 'almost impossible' for Manchester City not to drop points\nLike West Ham and Bournemouth before them, Watford camped in their own half and their proximity, physicality and sheer numbers frustrated City for long spells of the first half.\nSergio Aguero should have scored when he found a rare bit of space in the box to meet Bernardo Silva's cross, but the Argentina striker sent his header bouncing wide and Watford went in happy at half-time.\nSterling, with the assistance of referee Tierney's interpretation of the offside rule, quickly changed that - and City did not look back.\nThe whole atmosphere at the Etihad Stadium was lifted, and City's evening went from a grind to a stroll in the space of 13 minutes as Sterling added two more goals.\nWatford's top-six struggles continue\nWatford manager Javi Gracia's team selection suggested his focus was on next week's FA Cup tie with Crystal Palace. But if it was, the message did not reach his players.\nThey defended brilliantly in the first half, although it was at the expense of any meaningful advances into the City half.\nThat situation only changed when Deeney and Deulofeu appeared off the bench but, although they made an instant impact, City keeper Ederson had little else to do after picking the ball out of his net.\nAs well as the FA Cup, seventh place remains an achievable target for what has been an impressive season for the Hornets.\nBut their bid to finish above Wolves and potentially qualify for Europe for the first time since 1983 is being undermined by their form against the top six.\nTheir home win over Tottenham at the start of September is their only success, and indeed the only time they have taken any points against City, Liverpool, Spurs, Arsenal, Manchester United or Chelsea in nine attempts in 2018-19.\nOn the road, things are even worse - you have to go back to January 2017 for their last away win against any of those sides - and despite their initial resilience at a wet and windy Etihad Stadium, they showed few signs of improving on that record by taking three points here.\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)\n'Today is not luck' - what the managers said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It is the end part of the season so every game is important. For three months we wait to be top of the league and now we have to try and win our games.\n\"I am sorry if [the first goal] is offside but we deserve to win. Against Liverpool, [Watford] tried to press but here they have 11 players in the box. There was no space, but we found it and we created a lot.\n\"Today is not luck. Here there are many people working to make last season's level. If they can do that it will be down to hard work and not luck.\nWatford head coach Javi Gracia: \"In the first half we had a very good performance. We were better defensively because we were well organised, we didn't concede many chances.\n\"In the second half, the game changed. After conceding the first goal, there were some moments when we weren't so focused and then conceded two goals. Then it was impossible to have the option to get any points.\"\nOn Sterling's opener: \"I think everybody could see what happened. But this season I didn't criticise the referees and I am not going to do that today. In my opinion it is clear.\"\n'Sterling is Man City's main man' - MOTD analysis\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright:\n\"Raheem Sterling has been Manchester City's main man this season and he was again here.\n\"Watford were very resolute in the first half but Sterling kept going, making those runs in behind defences that City like.\n\"He has got to be up there as one of the favourites to win player of the season along with Virgil van Dijk.\"\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas:\n\"There's a bigger discussion to have with Raheem Sterling.\n\"The numbers - 18 league goals last season, 15 already this season. He's their go-to man. Pep brought him off after 60 minutes for a reason.\n\"You see Leroy Sane get rested. You see Bernardo Silva get rested. Raheem - never. He's a main man within that team.\"\nCity's remarkable home form continues - the stats\nCity have won 10 of their last 11 Premier League games (L1), and are on the longest current winning run in the competition (six games).\nWatford have lost all 10 of their Premier League games against sides starting the day top of the table, scoring just nine goals and conceding 29.\nCity have won 45 of the 48 points available to them in home games this season (W15 D0 L1), losing only against Crystal Palace in December.\nRiyad Mahrez has been directly involved in eight goals in his last seven Premier League appearances against Watford (six goals, two assists).\nSterling scored his hat-trick in 13 minutes and 12 seconds - the fastest in the Premier League since Romelu Lukaku's treble for Everton v Sunderland in September 2016 (11:37).\nSterling has been directly involved in 22 home goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Premier League player.\nSterling has scored in 52 games in all competitions for City, not losing any of those games (W50 D2) and winning each of the last 34.\nDeulofeu's goal for Watford came just 17 seconds after the Spaniard came off the bench, the fastest sub goal in the Premier League since Sammy Ameobi netted for Newcastle against Tottenham in October 2014 (eight seconds).\nDeulofeu has had a hand in six goals in his last four Premier League appearances for Watford (four goals, two assists), as many as he managed in his previous 19 games this season.\nWhat's next?\nCity look to become the third English club into the quarter-finals of the Champions League when they host Schalke on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), leading 3-2 from the first leg.\nThey then travel to play Swansea in the sixth round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 16 March (17:20), and the international break means their next Premier League game is not until Saturday, 30 March, when they are away at Fulham (12:30).\nWatford are also in action in the FA Cup next Saturday, when they host Crystal Palace (12:15). They also return to Premier League action on 30 March, when they are back in Manchester to play Manchester United (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 4-2 Burnley: Roberto Firmino & Sadio Mane score as Reds keep pressure on Man City\nLiverpool maintained the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City by coming from behind to beat Burnley in tricky conditions at Anfield.\nThe Clarets took a shock sixth-minute lead when Ashley Westwood scored direct from a corner, although it appeared Reds' goalkeeper Alisson had been impeded by James Tarkowski.\nBut the hosts were only behind for 13 minutes before Roberto Firmino tapped in after Tom Heaton had fumbled Mohamed Salah's cross.\nIn a first half played in strong wind and hailstorms, Liverpool took the lead when Sadio Mane curled a shot past Heaton.\nFirmino scored his second following Heaton's poor clearance and Burnley pulled one back late on through Johann Berg Gudmundsson from six yards out.\nBut there was no fightback as Mane then went around the Clarets' keeper in injury time for his second and Liverpool's fourth to seal the win, which leaves Jurgen Klopp's side one point behind City with eight league games of the season remaining.\nAnalysis and reaction from Liverpool's win over Burnley, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action\nPredict how the top six in the Premier League will finish\nWhere does Liverpool's current season rank with the best of all time?\nLiverpool fight hard for the three points\nLiverpool, aiming to become English champions for the first time since 1990, had faced questions over their character after a run of four draws in six league matches had seen them lose their lead at the top of the table.\nRaheem Sterling's hat-trick for Manchester City on Saturday gave Pep Guardiola's side a 3-1 win over Watford and left the defending champions with a four-point advantage.\nGuardiola said it would be \"almost impossible\" to win every remaining league match and all Liverpool can do is win their own games and hope for a slip-up from City.\nThe hosts made the worst possible start, trailing early on, but Klopp's team responded in fine fashion and showed their character to dig deep and overcome a hard-working and determined Burnley outfit.\nFirmino's shot was deflected over after 13 minutes, but six minutes later he had his 10th league goal of the season, scoring from close range after a mistake from Heaton following fine play from Salah, who had played a one-two with Georginio Wijnaldum.\nThe inclusion of Adam Lallana, making only his fifth start of the season, was met with doubt by many on social media - but he played a huge part in Liverpool's second, sliding in to block a clearance, with Ben Mee's subsequent challenge falling to Mane to curl past Heaton.\nA second error from Heaton, who gifted the ball to Salah, led to the Reds' third, with Firmino finishing after Charlie Taylor's challenge on the Egyptian fell straight to the Brazilian.\nAn injury-time goal from Burnley substitute Gudmundsson threatened a dramatic finish, but Mane - who had earlier hit the crossbar - finished the job with a goal in the 93rd minute.\nHeaton errors hurt Burnley\nFor Burnley, it was a third successive defeat as they were overpowered by Liverpool, who recorded 23 shots to the visitors' three, although the Clarets did manage to score from both of their attempts on target.\nTheir lead, coming from Westwood's left-wing corner, came in controversial circumstances as Alisson was sandwiched between Jack Cork and Tarkowski, with the latter having his arms on the shoulders of the Brazilian and holding him down as the ball sailed over his head and into the net.\nBurnley have not won at Anfield since September 1974 and boss Sean Dyche was unhappy with his side's defending and \"individual errors\".\nTwo of Liverpool's goals came from Heaton mistakes, with the goalkeeper hoping to be named in Gareth Southgate's England squad on Wednesday for the European Championship qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Montenegro.\nHowever, one positive for Dyche and Burnley's supporters came in the shape of 19-year-old left midfielder Dwight McNeil, who, according to his manager, produced an \"absolutely outstanding\" performance and was \"running around Anfield like a kid in a sweet shop\". The Clarets' fans even had brief hope of a shock and undeserved point when Gudmundsson scored after being set up by Matej Vydra.\nBurnley, in their third successive season in the top flight, are 17th in the table, only two points ahead of 18th-placed Cardiff City and face a four-game spell that is likely to be crucial to their hopes of staying in the Premier League.\nThey play Leicester and Wolves at home, before games against Bournemouth and Cardiff City, and Dyche will be looking for a good points haul - especially as their final four fixtures see them playing Chelsea, Manchester City, Everton and Arsenal.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\n'We gave them three goals' - what they said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Match of the Day, said: \"Are we allowed to talk about the conditions?\n\"We played our game. The first Burnley goal was maybe a little bit of the wind. In most countries it would not be allowed that goal - you cannot treat the goalie like that in the six-yard box.\n\"Adam Lallana didn't score but he was best man on pitch. He had an outstanding game.\n\"At 3-1 up all the balls Burnley got were from us. I'm completely happy with the performance - especially against Burnley.\n\"Nobody gets rid of us.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day, said: \"It was tricky. The wind was swirling. We wanted to ask questions and get the ball forward which I thought we did in spells.\n\"You cannot give a team like Liverpool four goals - we certainly gave them three. You can question the errors but we certainly made a game of it.\n\"In the first half I don't think they had too many golden chances yet we were 2-1 down. Even at 3-1, the mentality of the group was good and we got a goal back.\n\"If you had said to me that we would have 30 points after this stage of the season I would certainly have take it.\"\nOn McNeil's performance: \"He was absolutely outstanding. He's been a big factor in our turnaround this season.\"\nLiverpool extend unbeaten Anfield run - the stats\nLiverpool's tally of 73 points from their opening 30 league games this season is their joint-best total at this stage of a league campaign (adjusting for three points for a win), level with the 1904-05 second tier season and 1987-88 in the top flight.\nThe Reds are the first side to win four consecutive home Premier League games in which they conceded the first goal since Chelsea won six in a row between April 2013 and May 2015.\nBurnley have dropped more points from winning positions in their 30 Premier League games this season (10) than they did in the whole of 2017-18 (nine).\nLiverpool have now gone 36 Premier League games without a loss at Anfield (won 26, drew 10), the joint-third-longest unbeaten home run in the competition's history, behind only Chelsea (86 games between March 2004-October 2008) and Manchester City (37 between December 2010-December 2012).\nLiverpool have conceded nine goals in their 10 league matches in 2019, one more than they had in their 20 league games this season before the turn of the year.\nRoberto Firmino has now scored 10 or more league goals in all four of his seasons at Liverpool, the best 100% record of reaching double figures of any player for the club in the competition.\nFirmino has been directly involved in 100 goals in 175 appearances for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp (63 goals, 37 assists), more than any other player in that time.\nSadio Mane has become the fifth Liverpool player to score in six consecutive home appearances in the Premier League, after Michael Owen, Fernando Torres, Luis Suarez and Mohamed Salah.\nMane has now scored 50 goals in 109 appearances for the club.\nAshley Westwood scored his first Premier League goal for Burnley, and his first in any competition since April 2016 - 1,051 days ago - when he scored twice for Aston Villa against Southampton.\nMohamed Salah's failure to score means Alan Shearer keeps his record of being the fastest player in Premier League history to score 50 goals for one club. Shearer scored 50 times in his first 66 games for Blackburn, while Salah has 49 in 66 for Liverpool.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are in Champions League action on Wednesday (20:00 GMT) when they travel to Bayern Munich for the second leg of their last-16 tie after a goalless draw in the first match at Anfield.\nKlopp's side then play in the Premier League on Sunday, 17 March (14:15) when they face struggling Fulham at Craven Cottage.\nBurnley's next match is at home to Leicester in the league on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Hazard rescues point for Chelsea\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri is \"confident\" his side can secure a top-four finish after Eden Hazard scored a stoppage-time equaliser to rescue a point against Wolves at Stamford Bridge.\nHazard curled into the bottom corner in the second minute of added-time to deny Wanderers a memorable victory and ensure Chelsea remain unbeaten in the Premier League since their 6-0 thrashing at Manchester City last month.\nThe draw keeps Chelsea in sixth, two points behind fifth-placed Manchester United and three points adrift of Arsenal in fourth, albeit with a game in hand on all the sides above them.\nRace for the Champions League: make your top six predictions\n\"When you have to play only 10 matches, every match you're not able to win is a missed opportunity,\" Sarri said. \"In the last six matches, we won four matches and drew the other two. So there is a little consistency in this moment.\n\"We have one match in hand, so we have to be confident.\"\nRaul Jimenez finished off a swift counter-attacking move to put Wanderers ahead with their only shot on target nine minutes into the second half.\nThat looked to be enough, particularly when substitute Willian saw his curling effort well saved by Rui Patricio late on, but Hazard struck to salvage a draw with his 16th goal of the season.\nDespite only managing two attempts on goal all game, Wolves may feel aggrieved at only securing a point having defended diligently, restricting Chelsea to half-chances and efforts from distance.\nChelsea only had one shot on target during the first half, an effort from Gonzalo Higuain from a tight angle that was comfortably pushed behind by Patricio.\nSarri's side improved after going behind, with Pedro having a shot tipped over before Higuain failed to convert when the ball flashed across the box following a corner.\nIt was hard to see Chelsea scoring as the game entered added time but Hazard showed neat skill to turn away from Ruben Neves and finally beat Patricio from 18 yards.\nHazard secures unlikely point\nChelsea were looking to maintain momentum after back-to-back wins in the Premier League had eased some of the pressure that had been growing on Sarri after his side's thrashing at Etihad Stadium last month.\nAnother loss here may well have put his position under scrutiny once more, but Hazard's late intervention makes it three league games without defeat and seven points from nine since that defeat to the champions, though they have exited the FA Cup and lost the Carabao Cup final on penalties during that timeframe.\nAfter making a number of changes for Thursday's Europa League last-16 first leg win over Dynamo Kiev, Sarri restored many of his key players to the starting line-up, including Hazard and N'Golo Kante.\nHowever, they were subdued for much of the game, particularly during the first half where they managed just one shot on target.\nChelsea enjoyed 75% possession but precious little of it was in dangerous areas, with Wolves content to sit back and look to hit on the counter.\nHalf-hearted penalty claims were turned down when Hazard's corner hit Jimenez on the arm as he attempted to clear.\nRomain Saiss then had to be alert to clear the ball away from Hazard after Willy Boly's headed clearance inadvertently landed in his path.\nJimenez's goal after the break jolted Chelsea into action, with Pedro and Higuain going close, but it took a dramatic intervention from top-scorer Hazard to finally breach the Wolves backline.\nWolves continue to impress\nThey may have only managed one shot on target, but this was far from a smash-and-grab by Wolves.\nThe Black Country club have won more points against the 'big six' sides than any other club outside that group and have also taken points away at Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham this season.\nThat success has been achieved by being well organised in defence but also having a clear gameplan to counter-attack with speed.\nThat plan worked to perfection when, having restricted Chelsea to half-chances, Wolves struck with their first shot at goal 11 minutes into the second half with a move that started in their own penalty area.\nBoly's clearance found Joao Moutinho, who immediately found the onrushing Jimenez. The Mexican striker strode forward and exchanged passes with Jota, before forcing the ball beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga via a deflection off Cesar Azpilicueta.\nWolves were forced deeper as Chelsea pushed for an equaliser but held firm, with captain Conor Coady marshalling the back three.\nLeander Dendoncker also proved to be an efficient screen in front of the defence, with no Wolves player making more tackles or interceptions than the Belgian.\nThe fact Wolves, promoted from the Championship last season, are disappointed to only take a point is testament to the progress they have made this campaign.\nBut they can take plenty of encouragement from this performance as they prepare for their FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester United next weekend.\nMan of the match - Leander Dendoncker (Wolves)\n'We missed a very great opportunity today' - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri told Match of the Day: \"We were a bit unlucky because we conceded the goal in their first situation inside our box after 55 minutes. We need to move the ball faster and play one or two touches not five or six like today so we have to do better when we face a team that doesn't want to play.\n\"It is very difficult to play against 10 opponents in the last 25 metres. They [Wolves] were not organised, they defended very low, they didn't need any organisation in that case.\n\"We tried to change with [Ruben] Loftus-Cheek because he is a good presence in the opposing box and [Callum] Hudson-Odoi because to have someone able in the one-on-one situation is very important.\n\"In the last 20 minutes we played a new system, 4-2-3-1. For Jorginho it is very difficult to play when the other players don't have movement without the ball. When I decided to play 4-2-3-1 Jorginho was not suitable.\n\"In the last minutes we were losing so we have to accept the result. We missed a very great opportunity today but we have nine opportunities.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We performed well. It was the individual quality of one Chelsea player which allowed them to score.\n\"My players are sad because they know they had it. They've done a fantastic job. We were very organised and played with a great shape.\"\nWolves captain Conor Coady, speaking to Sky Sports: \"When you give Eden Hazard a chance on the edge of the box he is always going to score.\n\"It was so disappointing to concede so late. It's a sucker punch at the end.\n\"There's no real fear from us coming to places like this. We know we can sit deep and attack on the counter. Our goal was outstanding but we're gutted.\"\nWolves still unbeaten in London - the stats\nAfter a five game winning run against promoted sides at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea have now failed to win two of their last four such home matches in the Premier League (P4 W2 D2 L0).\nWolves are now unbeaten in six league games in London this season (W3 D3), their longest such run in the capital in the top-flight since November 1974 (11 games).\nOf the clubs not in the 'big six', Wolves have picked up at least two more points against that group than any other Premier League team this season (P9 W2 D4 L3 - 10 points).\nEden Hazard's equaliser was his 50th Premier League goal at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea, becoming the third player to do so for the club in the competition after Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.\nOnly Cesc Fabregas (6) has assisted more Premier League goals for Chelsea's Eden Hazard than Willian (5).\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals within a single season for Wolves than current striker Raul Jim\u00e9nez (12 - also Steven Fletcher in 2011-12).\nWolves duo Diogo Jota (one goal, two assists) and Raul Jim\u00e9nez (two goals, one assist) have directly combined for each of their sides last three Premier League goals.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea take a 3-0 lead into their Europa League last-16 tie away at Dynamo Kiev on Thursday (17:55 GMT). Wolves take on Manchester United live on BBC One in an FA Cup quarter-final at Molineux next Saturday (19:55 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-2 Newcastle: Matt Ritchie volley rescues point for Magpies.\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez believes his Magpies side need just one more win to secure Premier League safety following Saturday's dramatic draw with Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium.\nFormer Cherries player Matt Ritchie sent a spectacular volley into the top corner from DeAndre Yedlin's cross to lift the visitors on to 35 points with seven games left to play.\n\"The job is not done,\" Benitez said afterwards.\n\"It could be 38 points, or 40, to guarantee [safety]. I think 38 will be enough, but we have to keep winning.\"\nSalomon Rondon opened the scoring with a superb free-kick on the stroke of half-time but Joshua King turned the game in Bournemouth's favour in the second half, sending Martin Dubravka the wrong way from the penalty spot before finishing coolly into the far corner from Dominic Solanke's pass.\nBenitez was unhappy with referee Mike Dean's decision to award the hosts a spot-kick following Federico Fernandez's foul on Nathan Ake.\n\"There was a penalty [appeal] at the other end after 10 minutes which was not given,\" he said. \"You can check the pulling of Rondon. It's football, you have different opinions, but we're not happy with that.\"\nThe draw lifts Bournemouth above Everton into 11th place, while Newcastle remain 13th.\nRe-live Newcastle's draw with Bournemouth\nRitchie comes back to haunt his former club\nOnly Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United had collected more points than Newcastle from their last nine games before the Magpies' trip to the south coast.\nThe visitors were without two of their most consistent performers during that spell, with Jamaal Lascelles sidelined through injury and Fabian Schar suspended after picking up his 10th yellow card of the campaign against Everton last weekend.\nTheir replacements - Paul Dummett and Fernandez - coped admirably with the threat of Bournemouth's attack in the first 45 minutes, restricting the hosts to just two attempts before the interval.\nIt was Fernandez, however, who gifted Bournemouth a route back into the game when he pulled down Ake inside the penalty area following a Cherries corner, prompting Dean to point to the spot.\nHad it not been for Dummett's goal-line clearance from Callum Wilson's looping header, though, Benitez's side might have left the Vitality Stadium empty-handed.\nThe 25-year-old's effort appeared to be sailing over Dubravka and into the back of the net but the Newcastle skipper's acrobatic clearance rescued the Magpies.\nIn the end it was former Bournemouth midfielder Ritchie who made the decisive contribution, volleying home his first league goal from open play this season to edge his side closer to Premier League safety.\n\"It was a good goal, one of my better ones,\" said Ritchie.\n\"It's a strange feeling as I owe so much [to Bournemouth]. I wheeled away and realised I have a lot of respect for this club.\n\"I've hit a few like that here back in the day. It's just good to get a goal as I missed the penalty last week [against Everton] and goals have been few and far between this season.\"\nCherries on brink of safety\nEddie Howe said before the game that his Bournemouth side were still not safe from relegation, despite their comfortable cushion over the bottom three.\nThe Cherries would have hit the 'magic 40-point mark' had they held on for all three points, but it would still take a major collapse for Howe's charges to lose their Premier League status this season.\nThe hosts started confidently at the Vitality Stadium with Ryan Fraser striking the outside of the post with 10 minutes gone, but Jordon Ibe's clumsy challenge on Miguel Almiron in first-half stoppage time gave Newcastle one last opportunity to test Artur Boruc before the break.\nRondon, who announced himself to the Newcastle faithful with two goals in the corresponding fixture at St James' Park, curled home the resulting set-piece to put the visitors in the driving seat.\nBournemouth responded brilliantly after the restart, however, and drew level when King fired home his 10th goal of the season from the penalty spot.\nThey took the lead for the first time when Solanke - who had come on for Ibe only five minutes earlier - shielded the ball from Newcastle's defenders before teeing up King, who finished confidently past Dubravka.\nRitchie may have broken his former employers' hearts at the death, but it is surely a question of when - and not if - Bournemouth clinch safety.\nMan of the match - Paul Dummett (Newcastle)\nRondon likes playing Bournemouth - the stats\nBournemouth are unbeaten in their last 19 home Premier League games against non-'big six' sides (W10 D9), since losing to Burnley in November 2017.\nNewcastle have lost just two of their last nine Premier League games (W5 D2), after losing three of the four before that (D1).\nOnly Manchester United (10) have won more penalties than Bournemouth in the Premier League this season (nine), while only Crystal Palace (eight) have scored more than the Cherries (seven).\nCourtesy of Joshua King's 48th-minute penalty, Bournemouth ended a run of 138 minutes without a shot on target at the Vitality Stadium in the league.\nBournemouth's Jefferson Lerma has picked up 11 yellow cards this season in the Premier League, more than any other player and a joint-high for the Cherries in a single top-flight campaign (level with Harry Arter in 16-17).\nAgainst no side has Newcastle's Salomon Rondon scored more Premier League goals than he has against Bournemouth (four, level with Swansea).\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer (91) is the only Norwegian player to score more Premier League goals than Bournemouth's Joshua King (41).\nMatt Ritchie is only the second player to score against Bournemouth in the Premier League having previously played for them in the competition, after Glenn Murray for Brighton in January 2018.\n'A difficult one to take' - what the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe told a news conference: \"It's a difficult one to take - it wasn't a perfect game from us, we found the first half quite difficult but it was a much improved second-half display.\n\"Until we went 2-1 up I felt we were the dominant team. Newcastle put pressure on but we defended really well at times and it looked like we were going to see the game out until the ball fell to Matty's left foot.\n\"It's bizarre how football can find these stories, he's probably the one player on the pitch we didn't want the ball to fall to on his left foot as we know how he can strike the ball from distance.\n\"I'm sure I speak on behalf of the Bournemouth supporters, when you concede so late in the game and you think the referee's about to blow. But that's what makes the game special - it isn't over till it's over.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez told a news conference: \"I think we have lost two points. We did enough, especially going in 1-0 at half-time, to manage the game and get three points. It was a great goal from Ritchie and I'm happy for that, but we deserved three points.\n\"It's a very good point, to a draw against a very good attacking team and you're losing 2-1, it's a good point.\"\nOn Ritchie's equaliser: \"Sometimes these things happen, he was playing well for us in defence but to score against his former team, I'm sure he's happy and at the same time he's making all the Newcastle United fans happy.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth take on Leicester at the King Power Stadium on Saturday, 30 March (15:00 GMT), while Newcastle travel to Arsenal on Monday, 1 April (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Rodgers praises 10-man Leicester's mental strength after late win at Burnley\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers said his team played an \"outstanding mental game\" after they snatched a late win at Burnley despite playing much of the match with 10 men.\nThe Foxes had Harry Maguire sent off within four minutes for bringing down Johann Berg Gudmundsson when he was clean through on goal.\nDespite their one-man disadvantage, Leicester took the lead from a James Maddison free-kick after he was brought down by James Tarkowski, while Dwight McNeil levelled soon after.\nBut the visitors left it late and scored against the run of play when substitute Wes Morgan headed home from Youri Tielemans' cross.\nRodgers said: \"It was an outstanding mental game, especially when you lose a player early. Jonny [Evans] and Wes were incredible, and the guys worked together as a team. We took our chances well.\"\nThe result means Burnley remain in 17th place in the Premier League and keep their two-point cushion over 18th-placed Cardiff City, but Sean Dyche's side have played one game more than the Bluebirds.\nLeicester, meanwhile, are in 10th place and have crossed the 40-point mark with seven games of the season remaining.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive Burnley v Leicester as it happened\nIt looked to be a long afternoon for the visitors after Maguire's early dismissal and Burnley seemed more likely to find a winner in a wet and windy second half.\nBut it was Leicester who picked up the points in a stunning finale after Burnley failed to clear a last-ditch Foxes corner and an unmarked Tielemans was allowed to cross for Morgan's winner.\n\"We stayed calm,\" the Leicester manager said. \"When we were down to 10 men it was about having that energy and positive attitude. I was pleased with them at half time, they carried it out tactically very well with 10 men. We have the resilience and spirit in this squad.\n\"Wes epitomises the humble attitude of the group. He was a player I wanted to keep, he is a wonderful symbol of the changing room. He's a really, really good guy. I am so happy for him and he got a round of applause in the changing room after, which he deserved as it was a fantastic header.\"\nAn assured visiting performance\nSince Brendan Rodgers was appointed by Leicester City on 26 February, they have won three out of four Premier League games, more than they had in their final eight games under Claude Puel.\nHowever, when Maguire was sent off so soon into the game, it looked like it would be a tough task to seal another victory, this time away from home against a side who are battling to stay in the division.\nGoing into the game, Leicester had conceded more goals in the opening 15 minutes than any other side in the Premier League this season, so it looked likely that they might struggle. But Rodgers' side remained composed.\nA central midfield pairing of Maddison and Tielemans enabled them to press on the counter while a resolute backline kept the hosts pressed back despite the fact Burnley had 62% of possession.\nIt was yet another win for Rodgers against Burnley - he has now masterminded victories against the Clarets with four teams. And this was a stylish performance while under pressure.\nBurnley's slide continues\nAs the late season run-in approaches, this defeat could have deep implications for Sean Dyche's side as they failed to exert pressure on relegation rivals Cardiff City and Southampton, who are not playing this weekend.\nWith the game finely poised in the second half, Burnley looked likely to add to McNeil's first-half goal and were denied a penalty when Charlie Taylor appeared to have been brought down by Wilfried Ndidi.\nBurnley have conceded nine goals after the 90th minute this season and their defensive frailties were shown again when Morgan headed in his dramatic late winner.\nNot so long ago, Burnley went on an eight-game unbeaten run - their longest in the Premier League - but since beating Tottenham on 23 February they have lost four matches in a row.\nIn their next three games, the Clarets face Wolves, Bournemouth and Cardiff, and desperately need to pick up points to pull away from the relegation places, especially as they face a formidable final four matches against Chelsea, Manchester City, Everton and Arsenal.\nUltimately, they slipped to yet another defeat from a winnable game, as their alarming slide towards the relegation zone continued.\nMan of the match - James Maddison\n'We are in a tough spell'\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche speaking to Match of the Day: \"It can play with you psychologically when someone gets sent off so early, and we didn't get to grips with the game in the first half.\n\"You cannot go on about conditions, both teams have to deal with it. You are always wary of a set piece when it's a tight game and they have 10 men, but they stayed resolute, kept it hard as a unit and we didn't find a way of breaking it down.\n\"You need results, we are in a tough spell now and you want to come away with something especially against 10 but it is no 'gimme'. We did a lot right, but you have to score goals, simple as that. We created enough chances to at least nick a goal but that wasn't to be.\"\nBurnley's lack of form laid out - the stats\nBrendan Rodgers has won five of his six league meetings with Burnley (L1), beating them with four different teams (Watford, Swansea, Liverpool, Leicester). The Clarets are the first side Rodgers has beaten with four different teams.\nBurnley have conceded a league-high 14 goals from outside the box in the Premier League this season.\nBurnley's games have seen more injury-time goals than those involving any other side in the Premier League this season (13), with the Clarets shipping a league-high 10 times in the 90th minute or later.\nBurnley have kept just two clean sheets in their last 12 Premier League games at Turf Moor.\nBurnley's Dwight McNeil has had a hand in six Premier League goals this season (two goals, four assists), the second highest total for a teenager this term after Ryan Sessegnon (two goals, five assists).\nJames Maddison is the first Leicester player to score two direct free-kick goals in a single Premier League season.\nLeicester City have been shown more red cards than any other Premier League team this season (five).\nHarry Maguire's red card after 3 mins 11 seconds is the fastest in the Premier League since Gareth McAuley for West Brom vs Manchester City in March 2015 (1 min 29 secs).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley face Wolves at Turf Moor after the international break on 30 March (15:00 GMT), while Leicester welcome Bournemouth to the King Power Stadium at the same time."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 4-3 Huddersfield Town: Javier Hernandez double rescues Hammers\nWest Ham produced a thrilling late comeback to stop relegation-threatened Huddersfield Town moving off the bottom of the Premier League for the first time since December.\nHuddersfield led 3-1 with barely 15 minutes left before substitute Javier Hernandez inspired an incredible turnaround.\nAfter Angelo Ogbonna thumped in a header to make it 3-2, Hernandez - who was introduced by Hammers manager Manuel Pellegrini at half-time - scored twice in the closing stages to spark jubilant celebrations at London Stadium.\n\"We came back pretty good with the effort of the whole team,\" the Mexican said. \"In the second half we weren't sure if we could do it but we could.\"\nWhen skipper Mark Noble cracked in a penalty to put West Ham ahead, few could have predicted the drama which would unfold in east London.\nHuddersfield arrived without a victory on the road since November - and a mountain of injury problems - but their confidence was not dented as they levelled almost instantly through Juninho Bacuna's free header.\nAnd the away fans had more to celebrate when a well-worked free-kick ended in young forward Karlan Grant sidefooting them ahead.\nGrant, 21, cracked a thunderous 25-yard strike into the top corner after the break, leaving many inside London Stadium shellshocked and heading for the exits as the match approached the final 15 minutes.\nBut Ogbonna's header gave the home side hope, before Hernandez's headed double crushed Huddersfield and left them 16 points adrift of safety with seven matches left to play.\nThe Hammers consolidated their place in the top half as a result, staying ninth in the table - two points behind seventh-placed Wolves - after earning a third straight Premier League win at London Stadium for the first time.\nExperience proves the key for the Hammers\nWest Ham boss Pellegrini has been determined to get to the root of his team's inconsistent performances this season, yet this thrilling match only served to show why the Chilean has been left frustrated.\nThe Hammers have taken points from home games against Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United this season, only to slip to away defeats at Brighton, Burnley, Bournemouth and Cardiff.\nAgainst a Huddersfield side which had only taken six points on the road this season, many would have picked this as a home banker.\nHowever, the Hammers struggled to break down an organised away side for the opening 75 minutes, with the likes of Marko Arnautovic - coming in from the cold to make his first start since January - and Felipe Anderson unable to produce the creativity which they showed earlier in the campaign.\nAnd, although Huddersfield's opening two goals came from set-pieces, there were plenty more worrying moments as the Hammers were often left exposed at the back.\nBut it was the introduction of former Manchester United striker Hernandez, and another Premier League title-winner in French attacking midfielder Samir Nasri, who was introduced for the final half an hour, which ultimately paid dividends.\nNasri showed the guile and composure which made him part of Manchester City's success with a cool delivery from the right to the far post where Hernandez was left unmarked to stoop and head in the equaliser.\nWith momentum behind them, West Ham pressed for the winner and Anderson's left-wing cross picked apart the away defence, allowing Hernandez to nip in ahead of Town keeper Jonas Lossl and head home.\n\"I think this is a match for the fans,\" Pellegrini said. \"I think everyone was disappointed when we were 3-1 down but we did well to come back.\n\"I really hate it when my team play bad. Winning or losing I want to play well. But winning is the important thing.\"\nSwitching off at set-pieces proves costly for Huddersfield\nWhile Pellegrini had an air of surprised satisfaction in his post-match interviews, Huddersfield counterpart Jan Siewert could barely contain his anger.\nGoing into the match Huddersfield had only scored 15 league goals all season, netting twice in the same game just once in a 2-1 win over Wolves under Siewert's predecessor David Wagner in November.\nThe German watched his side clinically take their opportunities when they arrived against the Hammers, only to see their hopes of only a second away league win of the season undone by defensive lapses.\nAll three of the Hammers's second-half goals came from left-wing corners taken by Aaron Cresswell.\nTighter marking may have prevented Ogbonna climbing highest to head in the second, while the away side were slow to react when Nasri collected an over-hit set-piece for the third and Anderson picked up a short corner before clipping in for the winner.\n\"I worked everything out to give my players a possibility of winning here and they showed it - we were winning 3-1 but then they lost it with three situations,\" former Borussia Dortmund reserve-team boss Siewert, who replaced Wagner in January, said.\n\"For me it's hard to describe at the moment.\"\nHuddersfield's prospects of avoiding a return to the Championship after two seasons in the Premier League were already looking less than slim, but the travelling supporters appeared set to be given some rare cheer.\nIn fact, they could still have been celebrating victory even after the Hammers had levelled.\nThat extraordinary finish almost saw Terence Kongolo swing the game back in Town's favour when he found himself clean through at 3-3, only to see his casual left-foot curler palmed away by Lukasz Fabianski before team-mate Jason Puncheon volleyed over a difficult chance on the rebound.\n\"Can't you see on my face that I'm not totally disappointed?\" Siewert added.\n\"We were leading on the pitch - we scored three goals - something we haven't done already this season. And then we lost it.\"\n'I'm still trying to figure out what happened!' - post-match reaction\nWest Ham captain Mark Noble said: \"I'm still trying to figure what went on to be honest.\n\"We were pushing to get the second and they scored a breakaway third goal and I think everyone thought it was over - except us.\n\"We dug ourselves out and in the end, even though it was tight, we deserved the win.\n\"I'd take a 1-0 win over that all day long - especially when we go 3-1 down. But at the end of the day that's the Premier League. No game is easy and you have to turn up.\n\"I'm pleased we've kept our run going at home and we needed to bounce back after Cardiff last week.\"\nMan of the match - Javier Hernandez (West Ham)\nHow Noble has joined Di Canio and Cole - the stats\nWest Ham have come from at least two goals behind to win on two other occasions in the Premier League, having done the same against Bradford in February 2000 (5-4) and Everton in March 2016 (3-2).\nThis was just the eighth time Huddersfield have scored more than one goal in a Premier League game, but the first they have not gone on to win after seven previous victories and a draw.\nWest Ham are unbeaten in 17 Premier League games in which they have scored a goal since a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal in August.\nHuddersfield scored as many goals against West Ham this afternoon as they had in their previous 11 Premier League games combined.\nHernandez today became the first West Ham player to score two headed goals in a Premier League match since Michail Antonio against Watford in September 2016.\nMark Noble became only the third player to score 40 Premier League goals for West Ham after Paolo Di Canio (47) and Carlton Cole (41).\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, West Ham return to action on Saturday, 30 March with another home game against Everton (17:30 GMT).\nHuddersfield go back on the road again, travelling to Crystal Palace on the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-2 Liverpool: James Milner's penalty sends Reds top after scare\nLiverpool returned to the top of the Premier League but needed James Milner's late penalty to avoid dropping points at Fulham.\nLeading through Sadio Mane's 11th goal in as many games in all competitions, the visitors failed to put a limited Fulham side away, allowing the hosts back into the game.\nA dire defensive mix-up between defender Virgil van Dijk and goalkeeper Alisson gifted Ryan Babel an equaliser against his former club on 74 minutes.\nBut Fulham keeper Sergio Rico then made an equally poor blunder, dropping Mohamed Salah's curling shot and fouling Mane as the Senegal forward went for the ball.\nSubstitute Milner calmly hit his penalty down the middle as Rico dived right, sending a relieved Liverpool back to the top for the first time since 1 March.\nJurgen Klopp's side are now two points ahead of Manchester City, who have a game in hand.\n'Firmino needs a selfish streak' - Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink analysis\nNo doubt over Liverpool nerve - Klopp\nWhich two Liverpool players make Garth's Team of the Week?\nRelief for the Reds\nWith Fulham carrying little threat and unable to keep the ball midfield in the first half, this became a test of whether Liverpool could focus and avoid complacency.\nThey were far from their slick and incisive best - Firmino was poor aside from his assist for Mane's goal and frequently misplaced passes, Adam Lallana was anonymous in midfield and Joel Matip headed well wide when free at a corner.\nWhile Liverpool's defenders were alert enough to cut off Fulham's sporadic forays forward, it seemed that one-goal lead would be enough. But then their concentration lapsed.\nThey had a let-off when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's drive from outside the area deflected in off Floyd Ayite but was quickly disallowed, with the Fulham forward clearly offside.\nYet Milner then sliced a clearance with his first touch after coming on and it dropped between Van Dijk and Alisson. The keeper failed to come when beckoned, the Dutch defender's header back was weak and Babel was able to sneak in, the ball deflecting up off him past Alisson for the simplest tap-in.\nIt would have been an embarrassing way to cede ground in the title race but Liverpool's fervency to make amends at the other end ultimately induced a mistake from Rico to help salvage a vital victory.\nFor Fulham, they defended well against Liverpool's dangerous front three, with Tim Ream and Joe Bryan making key interceptions to deny Salah, and grew in confidence during a brighter spell in the second half.\nBut still 13 points from safety with seven games to go and champions Manchester City next up, pride and positivity is perhaps all they look to be playing for now.\nSadio's stellar streak goes on\nMane has been Liverpool's most potent threat over the past two months and from the start his team-mates looked to him to open up Fulham.\nHe took his goal superbly, shifting inside from the left to find Firmino cutting to the byeline before continuing his run on the diagonal to collect the Brazilian's return pass and fire a first-time strike past the stranded Rico.\nMane could end up this year's Premier League top scorer if this surge continues - this was his ninth goal in as many league games, taking his season tally to 17, level with Salah, Harry Kane and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and one behind Sergio Aguero.\nThe 26-year-old nearly had a second just before Babel's equaliser, heading a flick-on from a corner onto the top of the crossbar, before putting himself in the right position to beat Rico in winning the penalty.\nThat contribution was even more important given Firmino's out-of-sorts performance and another quiet day for Salah.\nThe Egypt winger scuffed an early chance wide, saw a turning strike saved by Rico and now has not scored in seven games in all competitions.\n'We lost the rhythm a bit' - reaction\nFulham boss Scott Parker, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The back end of the game we came strong and caused Liverpool some problems. It was pleasing, but we have lost [but have] some positives to take from the game.\n\"These players have been working really well for the two weeks I've been here. But you need to stay in the game against Liverpool. First half we did that. We changed things around a little bit and were in the ascendancy. The goal was what we deserved. We were in a position then to get the right side of it.\n\"I have seen some massive positives. I stand here two weeks on from being involved and these players are working to a maximum. The attitude and passion that comes with that means this club will be in a better place.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a bit like we are - we started really well, did a lot of good things and lost the rhythm a little bit.\n\"I'm not the most experienced manager but I've had similar problems after Champions League games - the first half is a bit rusty. We could've finished it off in the second half but if you don't kill the game at 1-0 up it's clear something like that can happen.\n\"I have no doubt about my players' nerves. I always want perfection but it's rare that you get it. People will say we should be more convincing in games like this but this is us, we are in the middle of a development, not at the end. How the boys dealt with it was brilliant.\"\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nIf Milner scores, you win - stats\nLiverpool have extended their unbeaten Premier League run to 10 matches (W6 D4 L0) and went back to the top of the Premier League for the first time since 1 March.\nFulham have now lost 25 of their last 26 Premier League matches against the 'big six' (W0 D1 L25), losing all 11 this season.\nLiverpool's James Milner extended his Premier League record of never losing a game in which he's scored - it now stands at 51 games (W40 D11 L0).\nSadio Mane has scored nine Premier League goals in 2019 for Liverpool - the joint-most in the competition along with Sergio Aguero.\nScott Parker became the first Fulham manager to lose his first three Premier League games in charge since Roy Hodgson in January 2008.\nMane scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season - the most by a Senegalese player in the history of the competition, overtaking Demba Ba's tally of 16 for Newcastle United in the 2011-12 season.\nWhat's next?\nFulham host Manchester City in the Premier League at 12:30 GMT on Saturday, 30 March.\nLiverpool face Tottenham at Anfield on Sunday, 31 March, with the kick-off at 16:30 BST."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-0 Chelsea: Hosts dent Blues' top-four hopes\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri says his side have reached their mental \"limit\" after their top-four hopes were dented by Everton's second-half resurgence.\nThe visitors dominated possession in the first half with Eden Hazard striking the post and Pedro wasting a chance from close range.\nBut their profligacy was punished four minutes after the break as Richarlison headed in following a corner for his 13th goal of the season.\nAnd the visitors' woes increased on 71 minutes when Richarlison was brought down in the area by Marcos Alonso, with Gylfi Sigurdsson scoring the rebound from his own penalty.\nAs a result, Chelsea failed to capitalise on their game in hand, and still sit sixth in the Premier League table, a point behind Manchester United, who they would have leapfrogged had they won. Victory would also have taken them level on points with fourth-placed Arsenal.\nHave Chelsea reached their limit under Sarri?\n\"We played probably the best 45 minutes of the season and then suddenly at the beginning of the second half we stopped playing; I don't know why,\" said Sarri.\n\"It is impossible that the situation is a physical problem because if it is, you can go down gradually, not in one second.\n\"It is very difficult for me to explain the change. Probably it is a mental block.\"\nWhen asked how worried he was that Chelsea's mental situation has not been solved, Sarri said: \"At the moment, this is our limit.\n\"If we are able to play like in the first half with consistency, then we are in another position in the table.\"\nFor Everton, a first home win since 13 January was a much-needed response following last weekend's defeat at Newcastle in which they lost 3-2 having led by two goals.\nIn that game, Jordan Pickford was an erratic presence in goal, but this time where there was no dip from Marco Silva's side and the England goalkeeper made a remarkable save to stop Gonzalo Higuain's deflected shot shortly after the hosts went ahead.\nEverton end struggles at home\nFour losses in the past six home games prior to this encounter had made Goodison Park a depressing place for Toffees fans.\nOwner Farhad Moshiri has spent more than \u00a3300m since he took over the club, but an inconsistent season looked set to continue in a first half where Chelsea were well on top.\nChelsea's early dominance came despite Silva using his programme notes to ask for a \"fantastic\" atmosphere similar to that at the goalless draw against Liverpool two weeks ago but it was only after the break that the hosts came to life.\nAndre Gomes followed his first-half shot with another rasping effort in front of the Gwladys Street End to give the home fans hope.\nAnd Goodison erupted with delight when Richarlison headed in after Dominic Calvert-Lewin's effort was saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nCalvert-Lewin came close to making it 2-0 when Bernard's cross skipped over his sliding lunge but the hosts did go further ahead after 72 minutes through Sigurdsson's penalty rebound after Kepa had stopped the initial kick.\n'Barkley, Barkley, what's the score?'\nChelsea will rue this chance to put pressure on their rivals bidding to finish in the top four and secure Champions league football for next season.\nThey still have the back-up of being able to qualify for next season's competition by winning the Europa League, and on Friday they received a favourable quarter-final draw against Slavia Prague.\nBut with Tottenham and Manchester United both losing last weekend, and neither of those two or Arsenal in Premier League action this weekend, it was an opportunity to make up ground.\n\"Of course this was important for us, so now we have less opportunities, we have to fight and defend our opportunities,\" said Sarri.\nWhen asked if he was worried this form would mean they miss out on the top four, the Italian said: \"If you are speaking about the second half, you are right.\n\"If you are speaking about the first half, we can do everything. If we play 90 minutes for eight matches like the first half, then we can do everything.\"\nThe visitors had enough chances in the first half to earn a two-goal lead as Hazard hit the post and Pedro, Higuain and Ross Barkley could not convert from close range.\nWhen they tried to respond in the second half, they were met with stern resistance from the Everton defence who appeared to learn the lessons from their defeat at Newcastle.\nPickford made two fine saves while Yerry Mina, making his first Premier League start since 29 December, was a strong presence in defence.\nChelsea's day was summed up by former Everton midfielder Barkley, who was booed every time he touched the ball, and was substituted after 65 minutes despite an impressive first-half performance.\nIn the closing stages, the home fans chanted: \"Barkley, Barkley, what's the score?\"\nThat treatment all seemed fair game, but the only sour note was an object thrown towards the England midfielder after seven minutes from the Gwladys Street End which, fortunately, did not hit its target.\nMan of the match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\n'Second half was everything I want' - what they said...\nEverton boss Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I said we have to do everything different to the first half. They tried but not in the way we planned. We played forward, tried to create chances and that is our model.\n\"[The first half was] everything I don't want and the second half was everything the way I want to play. I could see a desire to win the game and we could challenge a team like Chelsea. I'm very proud of the players because of what they did in the second half.\"\nMaurizio Sarri speaking to BBC Sport: \"We played the first half really, really well. We could have scored in five or six different situations. We stopped playing. We didn't defend. It is incredible.\n\"After a first half that was so good, the level of motivation was very high and the level of application was very high then suddenly we stopped. It is very difficult to explain.\"\nOnly Fulham worse away from home than Chelsea in 2019 - stats\nChelsea have suffered Premier League defeat at Goodison Park without scoring a goal for the first time since September 2013, when they lost 1-0 under manager Jose Mourinho.\nEverton have kept back-to-back home clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since doing so against Fulham and Crystal Palace back in September and October earlier this season.\nOnly Fulham (six) have lost more Premier League games away from home in 2019 than Chelsea (P5 W1 D0 L4).\nDespite scoring the rebound, Gylfi Sigurdsson has now missed three of his five Premier League penalties for Everton (60%). Indeed, 2018-19 is just the second Premier League season to see two different players miss at least three penalties (Paul Pogba being the other player) after 2003-04 (Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy).\nChelsea's Eden Hazard has now failed to score in each of his seven Premier League games at Goodison Park; his most appearances at a single away venue without finding the net in the competition.\nRicharlison has scored 12 goals in the Premier League this season; only three players have netted more in the competition in their first season at Everton (15 - Kanchelskis, Yakubu and Lukaku).\nEverton's Jordan Pickford (25 years 10 days) became the fifth youngest English goalkeeper to make 100 Premier League appearances - after Scott Carson, Joe Hart, Ian Walker and Paul Robinson.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Everton travel to West Ham on Saturday, 30 March (17:30 GMT) while Chelsea face Cardiff City a day later (14:05 BST)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-2 Man City: Pep Guardiola's side go top with Craven Cottage win\nManchester City cruised back to the top of the Premier League as they condemned strugglers Fulham to their eighth consecutive defeat.\nPep Guardiola's side quickly established their superiority in the west London sunshine, with Bernardo Silva's 20-yard drive finding the bottom left corner inside five minutes.\nCity, who had 10 shots in the first 15 minutes, added their second when Sergio Aguero sublimely lifted the ball over home goalkeeper Sergio Rico from close range.\nSome woeful defending from Fulham - who have now conceded 72 goals, the worst record in the top flight - contributed to both goals, with Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Joe Bryan both guilty of gifting the ball to City near their own goal.\nScott Parker's side also struggled to make an impression at the other end of the pitch and failed to register a shot on target.\nCity, who are chasing an unprecedented quadruple, move one point above Liverpool, who host Tottenham on Sunday (16:30 BST kick-off).\nThe Cottagers stay second bottom, 16 points from safety with six league games remaining.\nRelive the action from Craven Cottage\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action\nAguero's key contribution\nBy the time Aguero was substituted in the 57th minute Manchester City were well on their way to a seventh consecutive Premier League victory.\nAnd the 30-year-old, who is the division's top scorer with 19 goals, played as decisive role as usual in the final third.\nHe may have only managed 22 touches, but one of his first was seizing on to Fosu-Mensah's mistake to assist Silva's opening goal.\nSilva then repaid the favour to provide the Argentina forward the chance to continue his own rich vein of form - and Aguero delivered his 14th goal in his past 14 appearances.\nHis darting run gave him the time to execute the deftest of finishes as Rico closed in to narrow an already tight angle. It was Aguero's only shot on target but it brought him his fifth goal in eight Premier League starts against Fulham.\nIt also underlined his prowess against sides that come up from the Championship.\nSince his arrival in England from Atletico Madrid in 2011, no player has been involved in more Premier League goals against newly promoted teams than Aguero - who has scored 29 times and provided seven assists.\nFulham toil again\nWhile Fulham ran title challengers Liverpool close in their last outing at Craven Cottage - losing 2-1 after James Milner's late penalty - they barely laid a glove on City.\nWith injury depriving the Cottagers of 10-goal top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, they started the contest with a line-up that had seven league goals between them this season.\nIn contrast, the visitors - who are now 14 games away from the quadruple - were able to boast a combined 22 league goals among their substitutes.\nThe opening half emphasised the disparity of resource and the ambitions of the two clubs, as the best attack in the division repeatedly cut open the worst defence.\nFulham were fortunate to only be two behind at the interval as City created a succession of chances and Raheem Sterling appeared to have a valid claim for a penalty turned down after Fosu-Mensah's challenge.\nAnd even when City eased up in the second period, the hosts were still unable to muster an effort on target.\nInstead, City almost added a third goal when Kyle Walker fired a right-foot shot against the post after Sterling had laid the ball into his path.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Man City)\n'The first 15-20 minutes was incredible' - what they said\nManager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"The first 15-20 minutes was incredible with the way we played.\n\"After the international break you usually miss a bit with your rhythm, but the effort was there. This game was tricky - 12:30 on Saturday, a sunny day. That is unusual and that is why I am so satisfied.\n\"We are going to do everything to win. No matter the next competition, we will win the game. Fulham was a tough game for Liverpool and Chelsea so we knew it was going to be tricky.\n\"We don't think too much about what people say about the quadruple. What Liverpool and Manchester City have done in the Premier League both deserve credit. That's why we are here.\"\nFulham caretaker manager Scott Parker, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Anyone in my position knows the challenge I had. I thought we did all right. But you concede an early goal like that...\n\"I don't know if we were too tentative [early in the match]. I thought we were brave. You need to be brave against this team. It's the only way you can put a stamp on the game.\n\"You are where you are in the division. During games, there have been moments that have been pleasing. We know the predicament we are in but we need to finish the season strongly.\n\"I'm enjoying it immensely. The position I have is tough but I want to give the team an identity again.\"\nCity love London - the stats\nFulham have lost their past seven top-flight matches against Manchester City. Only once before have they suffered more consecutive top-flight defeats against one team - eight by Manchester United between 2005 and 2009.\nCity have lost just one of their past 10 Premier League visits to London, winning eight.\nFulham have conceded at least twice in their past 12 league games, the longest such sequence in the top flight since a run of 14 by Newcastle between May and October 1977.\nCity are the first side to face no shots on target in two consecutive away Premier League games - against Bournemouth and Fulham - since they also achieved the feat in November 2017.\nThe Cottagers failed to have an effort on target for the first time in 188 home league games.\nParker is the first Fulham manager to lose his first four games in charge in the Premier League.\nSilva scored in three consecutive Manchester City appearances for the first time.\nAguero has been involved in eight goals in his past five league starts against Fulham (five goals, three assists).\nWhat's next?\nFulham travel to Watford in the Premier League on Tuesday (19:45 BST kick-off), while Manchester City host Cardiff City on Wednesday (19:45) in their next league game."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-1 Watford: Rashford and Martial give Solskjaer first win as permanent manager\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer said Manchester United seemed \"on holiday\" as his reign as permanent manager began with a laboured win over Watford.\nThe victory was harsh on the visitors, who dominated possession for long periods and had superior chances, but it lifts United into fourth place above Arsenal, who play on Monday.\nMarcus Rashford's 10th Premier League goal of the season, after a superb through ball from Luke Shaw, gave United a flattering lead.\nAnd as Watford wasted further opportunities to earn their first league win at Old Trafford, Anthony Martial made them pay midway through the second half with a close-range finish.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure scored a late goal to fray the home fans' nerves further.\n\"It was a really nervy last five minutes,\" said Solskjaer, who was appointed on a three-year-deal on Thursday.\n\"They made it difficult for us and it seemed as though we were still on holiday or the international break. Both teams feel they should have points.\n\"When I won trophies here, we didn't play well in every game but [today] we lacked zip, urgency, and fitness.\"\nThe victory ended a run of successive defeats for Solskjaer, and took United level on points with third-placed Tottenham, who travel to Liverpool on Sunday.\nFollow all Saturday's Premier League action and reaction\nRelive Manchester United v Watford as it happened\nUnited struggle as new Solskjaer era begins\nAfter being appointed on Thursday, having lost only one of his 13 Premier League games in charge since taking over from Jose Mourinho in December, Solskjaer asked his side to work harder and warned against complacency.\nHowever, there was a tiredness to their play throughout, which, but for Watford's wastefulness, would have been punished. Paul Pogba also lacked his usual influence.\nWhether it was because of the international break or down to Solskjaer's new status, it was difficult to say. Far from being a party atmosphere inside Old Trafford as Ole continued 'at the wheel', there were times during the game when the wheels almost came off.\nThe visitors had 20 shots to United's eight, with eight of them on target, yet they were often tame. Doucoure could easily have given Watford the lead early on but fired wide from 10 yards.\nTroy Deeney might also have had a case for a penalty when he was charged in the box by Phil Jones.\nFor all United's failings, though, Rashford's well-taken goal and Martial's bundled effort, which Watford thought was offside, helped grind out a much-needed victory to keep United's Champions League hopes on track.\nTheir goals, in addition to those previously from Romelu Lukaku and Pogba, also ensured United have four league goalscorers in double figures for the first time since the 1995-96 season.\nWatford suffer from poor finishing\nWatford boss Javi Gracia will be hugely encouraged by his team's performance, as they began both halves on top and showed they are good value for reaching the top 10 in the Premier League and an FA Cup semi-final.\nGerard Deulofeu, who had his black tights cut off early in the first half because they didn't match Watford's green away kit, was a constant threat on the left, while Deeney gave Jones and Chris Smalling a busy afternoon in defence.\nYet every time they fashioned a chance, they could not beat David de Gea or skewed off-target - until Doucoure's well-worked late consolation goal.\nNot only did Watford miss out on a chance to win at Old Trafford for a first time, victory would also have meant they would have eclipsed their club Premier League record of 45 points, set in 2015-16.\nBut there were plenty of positives as Doucoure and Etienne Capoue bossed midfield, in addition to the threat down the flanks.\nThe only aspect the Hornets need to improve on before their FA Cup tie against Wolves on 7 April is their finishing.\n'Frustration in the stands'\nAnalysis from Old Trafford by Simon Stone\nThere was a nod to Solskjaer's appointment as manager before kick-off with a brief blast of the Stone Roses' 'Waterfall' from which United fans have derived their 'Ole's at the wheel' song.\nBut in truth, there was not much different at Old Trafford today.\nUnited fans have been singing Solskjaer songs since his appointment as caretaker boss in December and will probably continue to do so after the Norwegian leaves, whenever that is.\nWhat Solskjaer's hero status will not do is shield him from the need to win football matches.\nThere were no complaints of him whatsoever but as the hosts laboured in the opening stages and gifted Watford possession on far too many occasions for comfort, there was frustration in the stands. And that became anxiety as Watford were presented with their chance to snatch a point in added time.\nIt's a fair bet that, by the time United next play here, against Barcelona in the Champions League on 10 April, the souvenir sellers will have got their act together and got themselves some Solskjaer manager-related material to sell.\nBut for this appointment to work in the long term, Solskjaer needs to build a winning United team. And for that to happen against better teams than Watford and in the long term, he is probably going to need new players in the summer.\nMan of the match - Phil Jones\n'It was the start of the rest of the season' - What they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"It was the start of the rest of the season for us. If we can get 15 points, we'll be top three.\n\"Today will have done us the world of good fitness-wise. We know how hard it is to play against Wolves [United play them on Tuesday] so we need to make sure we have a team fit and available.\"\nWatford boss Javi Gracia: \"I think it was a very good performance, but a bad result. We didn't take the chances we created in the first half. We dominated the game, we had more possession, we created more chances. But we didn't score and they punished us.\n\"We are getting a lot of good results away but today was an exception. We need to improve before the next games.\n\"I'm a little bit frustrated. It was a good performance but we didn't take our chances in the beginning.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester United travel to FA Cup semi-finalists Wolves on Tuesday (19:45 BST) before hosting Barcelona on 10 April in their Champions League quarter-final.\nWatford face Fulham, who have lost all four games under caretaker boss Scott Parker, in the Premier League on Tuesday (19:45) before their FA Cup semi-final against Wolves the following Sunday.\nThe best stats\nManchester United have won 11 of their 12 Premier League matches against Watford, losing the other in September 2016.\nThis is the first time since the 1995-96 season (Scholes, Cole, Giggs, Cantona) that Man Utd have had four players score 10+ goals in a single Premier League campaign (Martial, Rashford, Lukaku, Pogba).\nSince his debut for Manchester United in February 2016, Marcus Rashford has scored 45 goals for the club in all competitions, more than any other player in that period.\nMan Utd goalkeeper David de Gea made seven saves in this match - only versus Spurs in August 2011 (9) and Liverpool in December 2014 (8) has he made more in a Premier League game at Old Trafford.\nWatford have lost each of their last 14 Premier League away games against 'big six' sides, since a 2-1 win against Arsenal in January 2017."

He has certainly laid a marker down,\" said Dyche.\n\"He's a really good player and I'm enjoying what he's doing.\"\nBurnley's victory, coupled with relegation rivals Southampton winning at Brighton, confirmed Huddersfield's demotion back to the Championship.\nRelive the action from Turf Moor\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nMcNeil catches the eye as Burnley dig deep\nBurnley boss Dyche started his managerial career with a 2-0 win over Wolves - in November 2012 when he was with Watford - and McNeil's strike ensured his 300th game ended with a sense of symmetry.\nMore importantly, it put clear space between his side and third-bottom Cardiff, although that gap can be reduced when the Bluebirds host Chelsea on Sunday.\nThis was a game won largely by Clarets perspiration, coupled with two pieces of inspiration from Lancashire-born McNeil.\nMcNeil, whose form this season has also been recognised with a call-up to the England Under-20 squad, showed quick-thinking from a free-kick to release Wood for the opening goal.\nThen, with Wolves threatening an equaliser, he calmed a nervous Turf Moor by showing his quality and fearlessness when driving forward into the visitors' box to score the second.\n\"That's my best moment in a Burnley shirt - I hope I get plenty more like it,\" said McNeil, who has scored three goals in his breakthrough season.\nMcNeil's strike was Burnley's only shot on target. They were starved of possession for long periods and needed to remain focused and organised to keep Wolves at bay.\n\"We can play better but the detail is in the basics,\" Dyche added. \"We did all the ugly, hard stuff to make it difficult for them.\"\nWolves pay the price\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo spoke in the build-up about the importance of his side not looking beyond Saturday, despite Tuesday's home game against Manchester United and, more importantly, next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Watford at Wembley looming.\nWhile it would be difficult to criticise their focus and application at Turf Moor, the away side lacked the ingenuity to break down an organised Burnley defence.\nWolves had almost 65% of the possession and spent more time in the opposing third than their hosts, yet only managed one effort on target.\nThat came when left wing-back Jonny Castro Otto arrived unmarked at the far post to head goalwards, only to see a perfectly positioned Clarets keeper Tom Heaton hold on to the ball.\nOtherwise the visitors failed to create many clear sights of goal, though Diogo Jota did curl an opportunist effort past the far post shortly after the restart and Leander Dendoncker was guilty of shooting wastefully over moments later.\n\"I don't think we deserved too much today to be honest,\" Wolves skipper Coady said.\n'I've always marvelled at our mentality' - post-match reaction\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It is a very important three points. The main thing was that, although we've played better, the detail was in the basics - doing the ugly, hard stuff to make sure we didn't give them too much. That was important.\n\"I've always marvelled at the mentality of the players. We had a real hit against Leicester when we dominated game and lost in the last minute - but we've had a break and the players are back energised.\n\"That bodes well and we have to maintain that and get points on the board. But today is a good sign of the mentality of the players.\"\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo: \"We started very badly, we lost concentration and communication and then it became much more difficult for us.\n\"In the second half we started well and had some good moments, but then conceded the second and the game was over. There are a lot of things we have to look at.\n\"We must be clinical and produce better. At the start of the second half we caused them danger but need to do it for the whole game and especially look at our defensive organisation.\n\"We can't concede how we did today, we made a big mistake.\"\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski (Burnley)\nBurnley rewarded for rare clean sheet - stats of the day\nBurnley registered their first clean sheet in nine league games.\nWolves have won just one of their past six Premier League games, drawing three and losing two, after winning three in a row before that.\nAfter keeping a clean sheet in two of their first four away league games this season, Wolves have conceded in their past 12 on the road.\nWolves defender Coady has scored three own goals in the league this term, with only two players registering more in a Premier League season - Liverpool's Martin Skrtel in 2013-14 and Brighton's Lewis Dunk in 2017-18, both with four.\nWolves' four own goals in the league this campaign is the most of any side.\nMcNeil has been directly involved in five goals in his past seven Premier League games for Burnley at Turf Moor, scoring three and assisting two.\nHe has been directly involved in seven league goals this season - three goals, four assists - which is the joint most of any teenager, level with Fulham's Ryan Sessegnon.\nWhat's next?\nWolves have no time to dwell on this defeat as they return to action on Tuesday when they host Manchester United in the league at Molineux (19:45 BST kick-off).\nBurnley next play on Saturday, 6 April when they go to Bournemouth (15:00)."

his second goal in as many games - by flicking Ben Chilwell's shot in off the post with the inside of his boot.\nLeicester controlled the game and missed a number of chances before Jamie Vardy sealed the three points in the 82nd minute by heading Youri Tielemans' cross in off the bar.\n\"I thought we were excellent,\" Rodgers said.\n\"We showed a real appetite and hunger and tactically we were very good.\n\"Our pressing was excellent, the boys are understanding tactically how we want to press and the importance of that.\n\"Each game, each day in training, we are getting more used to it.\"\nScorer Vardy missed an excellent opportunity in the first half, dragging a first-time shot wide of the post from 10 yards when left free.\nBournemouth created fewer openings but should have equalised just four minutes after Morgan's goal through Callum Wilson.\nThe England striker got on the end of Ryan Fraser's cross inside the six-yard box but his volleyed finish was too close to Kasper Schmeichel, allowing the Leicester goalkeeper to save.\nThe win means Leicester climb to eighth in the table, having won three games in a row since losing to Watford in Rodgers' first game in charge.\nThis came on an emotional day for the club as fans paid tribute to their late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who would have been 61 next week.\nLeicester v Bournemouth as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nRodgers revival rumbles on\nLeicester had to battle to win in their last game with 10 men against Burnley but this was a complete performance and one that showed Rodgers' desired style is taking shape.\nTheir passing was patient but vibrant with threat coming from across the forward line and they pressed high up the field to deny Bournemouth time to build from the back.\nRodgers' side repeatedly produced flowing attacking moves and had 18 shots over the 90 minutes, compared with eight from their opponents.\nVardy, who has four goals in four games under Rodgers, was the focal point but Harvey Barnes and Demarai Gray threatened on the flanks while James Maddison and Tielemans caused problems in central positions.\nThose four players are all aged 22 or younger, which only adds to the excitement of the resurgence under Rodgers.\nThe Foxes were 12th in the table when former manager Claude Puel was sacked, having lost five of their past six games.\nThey are now eighth - level on points with seventh-placed Wolves - and have won three games in a row for the first time since December 2017.\nBournemouth's away woes return\nThe defeat means the Cherries have lost 10 of their last 11 away games - the only positive result in that run being a win in their last game on the road against bottom-of-the-table, and now relegated, Huddersfield.\nManager Eddie Howe said he had \"no complaints\" with the result and said he was \"disappointed\" with his side's performance.\n\"Our away record is a concern and we are trying to find ways to improve what we do,\" he said.\n\"I want a game tomorrow after that performance.\n\"People travel a long way to come and see us play and we didn't perform.\"\nIn the first half, they played their part in an entertaining encounter with a chance for Joshua King following the one for Wilson, but in the second they offered little attacking threat.\nStriker Wilson only had 21 touches, the fewest of any starter, and none of those came in the Leicester penalty box in the second half.\nCentre-back Nathan Ake was the only player to impress as he repeatedly blocked shots from Leicester players, doing so four times - three more than any other player.\nThe win against Huddersfield is their only victory in their last eight matches, home or away, and Howe said before kick-off that they are still not completely safe from relegation.\nThey remain 12th - 10 points clear of 18th-placed Cardiff who have two games in hand.\nMan of the match - Youri Tielemans (Leicester)\nRodgers loves managing against Bournemouth - the best stats\nLeicester have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since a run of four ending in December 2017.\nBournemouth are winless in six away league visits to Leicester (W0 D3 L3), since a 1-0 win on Boxing Day in 1988 under Harry Redknapp.\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers has won all four of his games in all competitions against Bournemouth - the only teams he has a better 100% win record against in his career are Hamilton Academical (nine wins), Fulham (seven) and Coventry City (five).\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe is winless in eight away league visits to Leicester City during his managerial career (W0 D4 L4).\nBournemouth have lost 10 of their last 11 away Premier League games, winning the other.\nJamie Vardy has scored five goals in his last five Premier League appearances, after netting in just one of his previous six.\nLeicester's Ben Chilwell has provided three assists in the Premier League this season, more than he registered in his previous two campaigns for the Foxes (two).\nLeicester's Wes Morgan has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career, also netting three goals in his last four.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester's next game is against Huddersfield, whose relegation was confirmed on Saturday with with defeat to Crystal Palace, at the John Smith's Stadium on Saturday, 6 April (15:00 BST kick-off).\nBournemouth host Burnley on the same day (also 15:00 kick-off)."

They edged the first-half possession and had the best chance when Danny Ings - returning to the side after a two-month injury absence - was played in by Stuart Armstrong.\nThe striker opened his body to try and curl the ball past Ryan but Lewis Dunk was on hand to block his effort.\nRedmond managed the only shot on target and should have scored from another chance when he was played in down the right, but he drilled his shot wide.\nSouthampton took the lead after the interval when Yves Bissouma was sloppy in possession and the visitors burst into the Brighton box on the counter-attack, before Hojbjerg finished well.\nToo little too late for Seagulls\nFor 53 minutes, Brighton seemed content to settle for a point as they struggled to find any attacking rhythm.\nBut having gone behind, Hughton's side began to push forward and ask more questions of their visitors, producing nine shots in search of the equaliser.\nDunk found himself unmarked inside the Southampton area from a free-kick but could only head over the bar.\nMontoya hit the Saints crossbar moments later and then the hosts had a tame penalty appeal turned down when Davy Propper collected the loose ball inside the area before falling over under a Hojbjerg challenge.\nBrighton's place in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City at Wembley next week was only achieved after Solly March equalised with a stoppage-time free-kick in the quarter-final at Millwall.\nAnd when Sam Gallagher fouled Shane Duffy, it seemed as if the stage was set for March to reproduce his heroics, but his clipped delivery to the unmarked Duffy was not met with enough power to beat Angus Gunn.\nMan of the match - Jan Bednarek (Southampton)\n'It's going to be a hard slog' - what they said\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton speaking to BBC MOTD: \"We didn't play at a good enough level to win us the game.\n\"The last half an hour offensively we were good. But then you have to produce that little bit of quality and make the goalkeeper work.\n\"You've had the international break - some have been away but not all. I thought Southampton were better than us in the first half.\n\"We've done ourselves no favours today. It's going to be a hard slog to the end of the season.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl speaking to BBC's MOTD: \"It was a massive win for us. We played a good game today.\n\"The last three weeks we tried to work with this new shape.\"\nOn Brighton hitting the bar: \"You need luck - that is normal. But if you work like this then you deserve that little bit of luck.\n\"It's important to take as many wins as possible until the end of the season. We feel comfortable in the way we play.\"\nSouthampton maintain Amex dominance\nBrighton have just one victory in their past five home Premier League games (D1 L3), after winning four and losing just one of the seven before that (D2).\nSouthampton are only the second team to beat Brighton twice at the Amex in the same season (EFL Cup and Premier League) after Derby County in 2013-14.\nBrighton had 15 shots without scoring; only twice before in the Premier League have the Seagulls attempted more shots without scoring (21 v Watford in February 2019 and 16 v Watford in August 2017).\nSouthampton have won three of their past seven Premier League away games (D2 L2), after failing to win any of the seven before that (D1 L6).\nOnly Everton (14) have seen more of their games goalless at half-time in the Premier League this season than Southampton (13).\nSouthampton's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has scored four goals in the Premier League this season, twice as many as he managed in his previous six campaigns in Europe's big five leagues combined.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to Chelsea on Wednesday, 3 April (19:45 BST), while Southampton host Liverpool on Friday (20:00 BST)."

They have scored only 18 in their 32 games, finding the net just once away from home in 2019.\nThey were unfortunate not to make the scoresheet at Selhurst Park, with Chris Lowe twice forcing fine saves from Vicente Guaita.\nThe Spanish goalkeeper produced a one-handed stop to prevent the defender's header from nestling in the back of the net, before tipping another goal-bound effort past the far post.\nKarlan Grant also went close to giving the visitors the lead before half-time, but the former Charlton man failed to direct his effort on target.\nThe Huddersfield players received a warm reception from the travelling Terriers fans at the end of the game, but Burnley's win over Wolves and Southampton's victory at Brighton mean Siewert's side will be playing Championship football again next season.\nPalace edge closer to safety\nPalace have endured scoring problems of their own this season, particularly at Selhurst Park.\nRoy Hodgson's side had managed just 11 goals in their 15 home league games prior to Saturday's encounter, while only Fulham and Huddersfield have collected fewer points in front of their own fans in 2018-19.\nThe Eagles were aided by the inclusion of their talisman Zaha, who was passed fit to play having been a doubt with a hamstring injury.\nThe Ivorian was a constant thorn in the Terriers' side and played a crucial role in helping Hodgson's team break the deadlock, twisting and turning on the edge of the area before winning his side a penalty following Bacuna's foul.\nHowever, the former Manchester United man will be disappointed not to have got his name on the scoresheet after missing two gilt-edged opportunities in the second half.\nZaha failed to get his shot off in a one-on-one situation with Hamer, before firing wide of the target with only the Huddersfield goalkeeper to beat.\nAndros Townsend was just as wasteful, twice firing wide from promising positions on the edge of the area.\nFortunately for Hodgson's team, they were not made to rue their profligacy as Van Aanholt put the seal on a priceless win that puts clear daylight between Palace and the bottom three.\nMan of the match - Patrick van Aanholt (Crystal Palace)\nTerriers' fate sealed with plenty to spare - the stats\nHuddersfield Town have been relegated with six games to play - the joint-earliest in terms of games in the Premier League era (Derby County - 2007-08 and Ipswich Town - 1994-95).\nOnly Derby, who were relegated on 29 March in the 2007-08 campaign, have been relegated sooner than Huddersfield Town in a Premier League season.\nHuddersfield have failed to score in 38 of their 70 Premier League games (54.3%) - the highest such percentage in the history of the competition.\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has won four games in all competitions against Huddersfield as Eagles boss, more than against any other club.\nHuddersfield boss Jan Siewert is the first permanent Premier League manager to lose his first five away matches in the competition since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2013-14, when the Norwegian was Cardiff City manager.\nLuka Milivojevic (22) is now the outright third highest goalscorer for Crystal Palace in Premier League history, behind only Wilfried Zaha (30) and Chris Armstrong (23).\nCrystal Palace have scored nine penalty goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nMilivojevic has scored those nine penalties; only four players have scored more in a single season, with Steven Gerrard the last player to do so in 2013-14 (10).\nCrystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha has won more penalties than any other player in the Premier League this season (5).\n'We've got to come back strong' - what the managers said\nHuddersfield Town manager Jan Siewert, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is hard to say what I am feeling, disappointment of course. It sums the season up that a penalty decides the direction. I haven't counted but we've conceded maybe eight to 10 penalties this season.\n\"When you go into the dressing room at half-time and get applause from the opponent you must have done something right. But it is not enough to win games in the Premier League.\n\"For me in life there is failure and success and it belongs together, as a club we have to learn from the failures. The performance proved it in a way, we've got to go through all the details and come back strong.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I feel relief, the first half was nothing like what we wanted it to be. Fortunately they were not creating better goal chances but they had more of the ball and looked in control with us out of sorts.\n\"I must say at half-time things were looking bleak. We made a few tweaks and moved Wilf [Zaha] up front. It took until the 74th minute to score, that goal from the spot was a such a relief.\n\"Congratulations to Huddersfield, they are technically relegated but should be proud of their performance because they tested us. So in the end I'm happy we got the result. It lifts us to 36 points which, depending on results, might be a nice buffer from the bottom three.\"\nWhat's next?\nPalace face Tottenham Hotspur in the first game at Spurs' new stadium on Wednesday, 3 April (19:45 BST kick-off), while Huddersfield return to action on Saturday, 6 April at home to Leicester (15:00)."

Without a doubt it was the worst performance of the year.\"\nEverton were less impressive after the break, but by then the damage had been done, and Silva's side are now just a point behind Wolves in seventh with the prospect of Europa League football once more on the horizon.\nRead all of the reaction here\nFollow all the Premier League reaction from Saturday's earlier action\nUps and downs - who gets into Europe?\nFluid Everton at their best\nBoth clubs are approaching the end of the first season of their latest expensive reboots under new management - and on this evidence there are far more reasons for optimism on Merseyside.\nSilva has not won over everyone at Goodison Park but this attacking display, fresh from a win over Chelsea before the international break, bodes well.\nRight from kick-off the visitors were quicker in body and mind, forcing mistakes at the back and taking a fifth-minute lead when Zouma was allowed to head Gylfi Sigurdsson's corner down and in.\nIf the marking from Issa Diop and the placement of captain Aaron Cresswell on the post was slack, it merely set the template for the rest of the opening period as the Hammers' back four were picked apart almost at will.\nEverton's front four of Bernard, Sigurdsson, Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin were able to get in on goal time and again, with only a combination of desperate clearances, poor final balls and the alert keeping of Fabianski preventing the visitors from piling on the misery.\nBernard eventually added the inevitable second when he tapped in Seamus Coleman's low cross as Everton helped themselves to seven shots on target - their highest total in the first half of a Premier League game since November 2012 against Reading.\nThe second half was largely uneventful, although Richarlison did thump a header against the crossbar and Fabianski ended the night with seven saves - six more than England number one Jordan Pickford was required to make at the other end.\n\"I was very proud of our performance and seeing our desire from the first minute,\" Silva told MOTD.\n\"We were the best team on the pitch, we were playing good football and creating chances. Two nil at half time was a good result for them because it could have been five or six nil. We created chance after chance.\"\nBack to the drawing board for Pellegrini\nWest Ham had finally looked like making their troubled move to London Stadium work, with the hosts unbeaten in their previous six games in Stratford, but there were no home comforts to be taken from this chastening display.\nWith no Felipe Anderson or Mark Noble in the side, Manuel Pellegrini's XI were terrible in the first 45 minutes and the Chilean manager saw his side loudly booed off at the end of each half.\nThe hosts mustered just one shot on target all evening and even the hitherto excellent Declan Rice was left struggling as Andre Gomes and Idrissa Gueye ruled midfield for Everton.\nUp front, Marko Arnautovic continues to struggle. The 29-year-old scored twice for Austria during the break but hasn't found the net for the Hammers since asking to leave for a \u00a3200,000-a-week deal in China in January and limped off to the sound of jeers in the 67th minute.\nTheir toothless display saw a total of just three attempts on goal in the game, their lowest tally in a home Premier League game since the 2005-06 season.\nWest Ham have already drawn level with their points total from last season but, with games against Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham to come next month face sleepwalking to the end of the campaign.\nMan of the match - Andre Gomes (Everton)\nHammers' home run ends - stats of the day\nWest Ham lost for the first time in seven Premier League games at London Stadium (W4 D2).\nEverton have scored two or more goals in three consecutive away Premier League games for the first time since December 2016.\nWest Ham faced nine shots on target in this game, the most by an opposition side at London Stadium in the Premier League since May 2017 (11 by Liverpool).\nEverton secured a victory for the first time in their last 11 Premier League games in London (D3 L7).\nEverton boss Marco Silva ended a run of nine matches in London without a win in all competitions (W0 D1 L8).\nKurt Zouma has scored two goals in 26 Premier League games this season, as many as he netted in his previous four campaigns in the competition (2 in 81 apps).\nSince his debut for Everton in August 2017, Gylfi Sigurdsson has been directly involved in 23 goals in the Premier League, seven more than any other player for the club (16 goals, 7 assists).\nBernard scored his first Premier League goal in his 28th appearance in the competition, ending a run of 1585 minutes without a goal.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham have next weekend off before travelling to take on Chelsea on Monday 8 April (20:00 BST), while Everton host Arsenal next Sunday afternoon (14:05)."

        "article_text": "Cardiff City 1-2 Chelsea: Visitors come from behind with Azpilicueta and Loftus-Cheek goals\nChelsea staged a remarkable late revival to snatch a controversial victory at relegation-threatened Cardiff City and ease the intensifying pressure on boss Maurizio Sarri.\nPonderous and painfully slow, Chelsea controlled possession but did little with it as they were comfortably shackled by a disciplined Cardiff side during a goalless first half.\nThe hosts took the lead less than a minute into the second period thanks to Victor Camarasa's delicate curling volley, prompting cries of \"we want Sarri out\" from Chelsea's travelling fans.\nWith five minutes left, Cesar Azpilicueta nodded in an equaliser from a clearly offside position and then, in added time, substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek headed the winner to break Cardiff hearts.\nWarnock laments 'worst officials in the world'\nChelsea boss Sarri 'getting used' to criticism from fans\nReaction from Cardiff City Stadium\nThe result is a major blow to Cardiff's bid for Premier League survival, leaving them five points adrift of safety with seven games remaining.\nFor Chelsea, however, it is a major reprieve for their hopes of securing Champions League football next season, keeping them within a point of Manchester United in fourth place.\nAnd nobody will be feeling more relieved than Sarri after he faced repeated calls to be sacked from the travelling supporters.\nChelsea fans turn on Sarri\nThe Italian was already under pressure before this match, with a run of four defeats from five away matches and fans growing frustrated with the patient, arguably overly pragmatic style of football known as 'Sarriball'.\nThey vented their anger on several occasions at Cardiff City Stadium, and justifiably so given their side's largely toothless display.\nSarri had decided to rest two of his most important players, Eden Hazard and N'Golo Kante, who both joined Callum Hudson-Odoi on the bench despite the clamour to hand the 18-year-old winger his first Premier League start following his impressive recent debut for England.\nHazard's creativity and Hudson-Odoi's dynamism would have been useful for Chelsea in a sterile start to the game, as they dominated possession but at a walking pace.\nOnce again, Gonzalo Higuain cut a forlorn figure up front, dropping deep in search of the ball and often outnumbered by Cardiff's swarming defence.\nAdded to that, there was no penetration from a midfield three of Mateo Kovacic, Ross Barkley and Jorginho, whose second-half substitution was met with ironic cheers from the travelling supporters.\nBut it was Sarri for whom they reserved their most stinging vitriol, mocking 'Sarriball' and demanding the Italian's sacking in a string of furious chants.\nChelsea's players pressed forward in search of an equaliser as the second half wore on, but there was little conviction or genuine threat against a Cardiff side who had conceded 57 goals in their previous 30 matches.\nThat was until the 84th minute when Marcos Alonso flicked on a cross to Azpilicueta, who was a foot offside but allowed to head in from close range, much to the rage of the Cardiff crowd.\nA draw would still not have been much use to Chelsea's hopes of a top-four finish, and they got their full reprieve when Willian swung an injury-time cross to the back post, where substitute Loftus-Cheek headed in powerfully to spark celebrations in the away end - and a huge sigh of relief from Sarri.\nA cruel blow for Cardiff's survival hopes\nWhile Sarri reflected on his lucky escape, his counterpart Neil Warnock exploded with indignation.\nThis was a result which could have huge ramifications for Cardiff's bid for Premier League survival, and referee Craig Pawson's controversial late decisions were fuel to the flames of Warnock's fury.\nHis side were playing catch-up before a ball had been kicked, as Burnley and Southampton's wins on Saturday had left the Bluebirds five points adrift of safety.\nBut before the late drama here, Cardiff were on the cusp of a fourth win from seven Premier League matches which would have done wonders for their aim of avoiding relegation.\nThis would have been their most notable scalp of the season and, although it was against a Chelsea side playing well short of their potential, Cardiff deserved credit for the way in which they negated their opponents with a diligent and well-drilled display.\nThey were content to allow Chelsea the ball for long periods, while carrying a threat on the break with Josh Murphy a livewire on the right wing.\nAnd although Cardiff are not renowned for aesthetically pleasing football, their goal was a thing of beauty, Camarasa barely breaking stride as he swept in a curling volley just inside the Chelsea penalty area.\nIt was to prove in vain, with Azpilicueta's goal from an offside position incurring the wrath of the home crowd.\nThe mood darkened further still when Pawson showed Antonio Rudiger a yellow card for bringing down Kenneth Zohore as he bore down on goal, with the home fans believing the offence warranted a sending off.\nAnd then the final blow came in added time as Loftus-Cheek headed in the winner, leaving Cardiff's dumbstruck players and fans wondering how they had been denied a precious victory, and cursing the controversial calls which contributed to the late turnaround.\nMan of the match - Aron Gunnarsson (Cardiff)\nThe late, late show - the stats\nChelsea have now scored 18 goals in the final 15 minutes of Premier League matches this season, no club in the competition has managed more.\nCardiff City are only the third team in Premier League history to lose four consecutive matches against a particular opponent despite opening the scoring each time.\nSix of the eight Premier League points Chelsea have won from losing positions this season have come home and away versus Cardiff.\nRuben Loftus-Cheek's winner for Chelsea was his fourth Premier League goal of the season on his 17th appearance - one more than he managed in his previous 46 matches in the competition.\nLoftus-Cheek's goal was Chelsea's first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League since Frank Lampard scored against Everton in February 2014.\nCesar Azpilicueta is the 14th different player to score for Chelsea in the Premier League this season - only Manchester United have had more different scorers in 2018-19.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in action on Wednesday. While Cardiff are at title-chasing Manchester City (19:45 BST), Chelsea host Brighton at the same time."

Liverpool had the win, just as it looked as if they would have to settle for a point and hand the title advantage to City.\nAnd yet credit to Klopp's side. Just as they did by winning 2-1 with a late penalty at Fulham in their last league game, they refused to lose the belief that they could win. They did so in a game where their opponents were the stronger side for much of the second half.\nAs Klopp went through his mandatory fist-pumping in front of the home support, you could sense just how significant this late show might prove to be.\nSpurs miss killer instinct\nTottenham's players slumped to the ground in anguish at the final whistle; they clearly felt they had been denied their just reward.\nMauricio Pochettino's side may actually have been unhappy with a point but suffered for their own flaws in front of goal, especially when Sissoko missed that huge chance with the score level and Spurs on top.\nThere was not a shred of conviction as he bore down on Liverpool keeper Alisson. Instead there was almost a desperation to get rid of the ball to the adjacent Son Heung-min, but the responsibility was his and he choked by hoisting a hopeless finish well over the top.\nDele Alli was then inches off target and as long as this potent Liverpool side were in contention there was always the threat of that last-ditch hammer blow.\nSpurs, after a tame first half, were outstanding in the second, but they are now without a Premier League win since 10 February and are embroiled in the fight for a top four place - with a Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City to come.\nThere is so much quality in this side but they wasted a huge chance here and ended up with an unwanted statistic to their name; it is the first time they have lost four consecutive Premier League away matches since a sequence under Harry Redknapp between December 2008 and January 2009.\nAnd there is now only a single point separating Spurs in third and Chelsea in sixth.\n'He has let Tottenham down too many times' - Jenas on Lloris\nFootball Daily: Liverpool's title hopes live on\nMan of the match - Andrew Robertson (Liverpool)\n'There are 500 ways to win a game' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I was relatively calm [after the winning goal] because it was a surprise. I saw the header and nothing else. I had no clue how the ball went in.\n\"In the first half, we had fantastic chances and scored a wonderful goal. In the second half, we looked heavy and couldn't really play. They changed only a little bit. We didn't adapt well. After Spurs' goal, we started playing again more.\n\"We compete with the best team in the world [Manchester City] and play against one of best in the world in Tottenham - it is a tough task.\n\"City last year were champions and are still pretty good. We have to fight like crazy. The crowd was outstanding. They were really here to push us and at the end it helped. It is only positive. I said there are 500 ways to win a football game and today was slightly ugly. Who cares?\n\"We compete with the best team in world for one position and that is really hard.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We are all disappointed but at the same time we have to be happy with our second-half performance.\n\"We were a little bit unlucky to concede the second goal when we should have been ahead because we dominated Liverpool, who are a very good team.\n\"No one wants to lose but it's a different defeat than the ones we suffered against Southampton or Burnley. We cannot say it's positive but now we start from zero and we can achieve what we want.\n\"I was telling the players in the changing room we have seven games and we are in top four and need to compete. It's a mini league and, playing the way we played today, I think we can achieve the top four.\"\nTottenham toil at Anfield - the stats\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten home league run to 37 games (W27 D10) - the joint-second longest such streak in Premier League history (level with Manchester City), behind only Chelsea's 86-match run between 2004-2008.\nLiverpool's total of 79 points is their best tally after 32 matches of a top-flight season (adjusting to three points for a win), surpassing the 76 they had in 1987-88.\nTottenham have now lost 17 of their 27 Premier League visits to Anfield (W2 D8); only at Old Trafford (21) have they lost more away games in the competition.\nLiverpool have scored three winning goals in the 90th minute or later in the Premier League this season, their second-most in a single campaign after 2008-09 (four).\nTottenham's Toby Alderweireld is the first player to score a match-winning own goal in the 90th minute or later of a Premier League game since Troy Deeney for Watford against Manchester United in November 2015.\nThis was Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino's 150th defeat as a manager in all competitions, seven of which have been inflicted by Liverpool. Only against Chelsea (nine) has he suffered more defeats.\nLiverpool's Roberto Firmino has scored seven goals in his past six Premier League games at Anfield, as many as in his previous 25 beforehand.\nAndy Robertson has nine assists for Liverpool in the Premier League this season; Andy Hinchliffe (1994-95) and Leighton Baines (2010-11) are the only defenders to have had more in a single campaign (both 11).\nSpurs midfielder Christian Eriksen is just the second player to assist 10 or more Premier League goals in four successive seasons, after David Beckham for Manchester United between 1997-98 and 2000-01.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Southampton for their next Premier League game on Friday 5 April (20:00 BST). Tottenham resume their Premier League duties at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday 3 April (19:45 BST)."

They have been flying at the Emirates all season. When you think about it, the top four looked too far away at the start of the season but it's in their hands now, although five of the last seven [games] are away for them.\nThey limited Newcastle to very few chances. You feel Arsenal fans are right behind Emery. In some ways they are overachieving this season.\nMan of the match - Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal)\nArsenal hold bragging rights over Spurs for the first time since December - the stats\nArsenal have won 10 consecutive Premier League home games within the same season for the first time since May 1998.\nArsenal have kept three consecutive clean sheets in all competitions for the first time since December 2017.\nNewcastle have lost 28 Premier League games against Arsenal - no other side has beaten them more often in the competition.\nArsenal are finishing a Premier League matchday ahead of Tottenham in the table for the first time since 2 December, after they beat their north London rivals 4-2.\nTwenty of Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette's 27 Premier League goals have come in home games (74%).\nArsenal have won all 17 of their Premier League home games in which Aaron Ramsey has scored for them.\nDespite making only five substitute appearances this season, no player has been involved in more Premier League goals as a sub in 2018-19 than Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (six - four goals, two assists).\n'We're in a good moment' - what they said\nArsenal manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"We played very consistent over 90 minutes. We didn't concede any chances. We created and dominated the match. We are happy.\n\"Each match is very difficult - we got three points and did it our way. It's a nice challenge to win consecutive matches - it's a new history - and we're creating our own way. We're in a good moment but each match is a new test.\n\"I hope Ramsey's injury is not serious. The doctor is thinking it's a small injury.\n\"We are improving. Today we are third, but the next match against Everton is difficult and our rivals are going to win a lot of matches.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"We played against a good team and were fine for a while in the first half. We could avoid their goal, it was a little bit lucky.\n\"We had situations on the counter attack where we could be more dangerous but we didn't do it. The last 10 minutes they had chances to score but until the second goal we were pushing. It is a shame because you could feel the atmosphere was getting nervous.\n\"When you play top sides away it can be a mistake which makes the difference. In the end it was a mistake and we must learn from this and be ready for the next one.\n\"I think 38 points is enough [to stay up], 40 just in case. Hopefully it will be less.\"\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are next in action with a Premier League away game at Everton on Sunday, before a home match against Napoli in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on 11 April.\nNewcastle entertain Crystal Palace on 6 April and then face Leicester away from home on 12 April."

We always knew it was a tough ask to stay up but it is the way we lost the game which is most disappointing for me.\n\"The five or 10-minute spell when we conceded three goals was our season in a snapshot.\n\"I have ideas of [where it went wrong] but it's not the time to broadcast it. When a club gets relegated you know there are some serious issues.\"\nWatford boss Javi Gracia: \"We can now think about the next game - an important game, a semi-final. All the people are looking forward to the moment. To achieve 46 points is something amazing.\n\"Fulham played better than us in the first half but the whole team was much better in the second half.

Both of Young's red cards in the competition have been shown by Dean (January 2009 for Aston Villa versus Sunderland was the other).\nUnited have had more goalscorers (excluding own-goals) than any other Premier League team this season (16).\nRaul Jimenez has been directly involved in 19 Premier League goals this season (12 goals, 7 assists) - five more than any Wolves player has registered in a single season in the competition.\n'An excellent performance' - what they said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a good night, a good game of football.\n\"What more can you ask? We know it was very difficult. The extra effort the boys had to make and how they react to the first goal - I'm really pleased.\n\"I give credit to United for how they shaped themselves, it was difficult to recover the ball.\n\"Even after the red card it is always difficult against United. We created spaces and had more chances. If there's one thing I can complain about it is being more clinical.\n\"The preparation starts now for the [FA Cup] semi-final - we will rest and prepare for a difficult game. A fantastic challenge for us.\"\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"We played some fantastic stuff, first 20 minutes we should have been two or three up and I'm not exaggerating, but we didn't pounce on big moments in the game.\n\"Scott McTominay played really well tonight, he's been excellent. He gave us a goal threat, energy and legs - I'm very pleased with him.\n\"There were a couple of mistakes from us. We gave them that first goal, we have to be honest.\"\nOn Ashley Young's sending off: \"When you're on a yellow and you go in you're always in danger of getting another one. He hit the ball but followed through and hit him. It's a yellow card.\n\"With 10 men it's hard but we had to keep the ball. We didn't want them to put pressure on us. They scored with their first chance after the sending off and you have to give them credit for that.\n\"I'm very disappointed with the result but pleased with the performance up until 75 minutes - it was an excellent performance from the boys.\"\nWhat's next?\nUnited need to quickly regroup as they play Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie at Old Trafford on 10 April.\nThey are next in league action on 13 April - at home against West Ham, but will be without Young and fellow defender Luke Shaw after his first-half booking was his 10th of the season, meaning he will serve a two-game domestic ban.\nWolves' next match is their FA Cup semi-final against Watford at Wembley on 7 April and they return to league action on 13 April, away at Southampton."

It ranks alongside any in the world.\nSpurs fans gathered around their new home hours before kick-off, the space-age structure dominating the skyline and the local area.\nAnd the pre-match ceremonials matched the occasion, with the stadium's place in the community highlighted alongside the obvious sporting and financial benefits to Spurs.\nThe motto for the occasion was 'Welcome Home' and one English tradition, the weather, obliged as the stadium was hit by a dramatic hail and snow storm an hour before kick-off.\nAnd the vast South Stand, rising in one tier and home to 17,500 fans, was already providing a wall of sound when the pomp and ceremony got under way.\nA giant golden cockerel, illuminated in the night sky, looked down from that stand as Gladesmore Community School choir performed \"Everybody Dreams\", which was written as an anthem of hope for the area's young people after the Tottenham riots in 2011.\nAs the teams lined up, award-winning tenor and Spurs' fan Wynne Evans and former Gladesmore student Lanya Matthews delivered a rousing rendition of \"Glory, Glory Tottenham Hotspur\" before a spectacular firework display whipped around the roof of the stadium.\nThe first-half mediocrity rather poured cold water on the mood of celebration but when the action did materialise, and the opening goal was scored, the roars and atmosphere confirmed Spurs' new home combines all the mod cons with good old-fashioned atmosphere.\nHaving not won in the league for nearly two months, these new surroundings can provide renewed impetus as they fight for a top-four place and prepare for a Champions League quarter-final first leg against Manchester City here next Tuesday.\nThe performance may not have been one of their best but the scoreline and the occasion was exactly what Spurs and their supporters, who revelled in finally being able to take their seats, would have wanted.\nImportant win as Spurs face 'serious fight' for top four\nThe sight of Arsenal overtaking Spurs in the Premier League with victory over Newcastle United on Monday will have acted as a jolt to the system of Mauricio Pochettino's side after the disappointment of their own last-minute loss at Liverpool on Sunday.\nIt certainly focused the minds of players away from the party taking place around them.\nSpurs are now in a serious fight for a place in the top four along with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, so all the flag-waving and elation of this landmark occasion would have been seriously diluted had they extended a sequence of five league games without a win.\nIn unfamiliar surroundings, it was perhaps inevitable that Spurs took some time to get going and for a while it was Crystal Palace's supporters who were making most of the noise.\nRoy Hodgson's side, organised and resilient, made Spurs fight for this win that will revive some of the confidence that has been lost recently - the only surprise being that Harry Kane did not get a goal to mark this new beginning.\nIn among all the fanfare, this was a night when victory was what mattered most and manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players will be relieved and delighted to have succeeded in the serious business.\nWhat next for Crystal Palace?\nCrystal Palace are where you would expect them to be under Roy Hodgson - relatively safe, unthreatening, now living comfortably around mid-table.\nThere was genuine, and understandable, disappointment among Palace fans and criticism of Hodgson when they lost in the FA Cup quarter-finals at Watford, a sense of a big opportunity missed.\nHere they were stubborn, kept Spurs at bay for almost an hour but then did not really threaten until it was too late. They came and went without contributing much.\nWill this be enough to keep the big, ambitious talents such as Zaha and Aaron Wan-Bissaka happy and at Selhurst Park next season? Will it be enough to keep their passionate support happy?\nIt is debatable.\nPalace are in no danger of going down but there remains the suspicion they could and should be doing much better, producing much more, with the talent at Hodgson's disposal, especially at home in one of the Premier League's most atmospheric and supportive stadiums.\nThey are functional and methodical in a typical Hodgson way but there is enough quality in this side to be better than that and this has been little more than a holding operation this season.\nMan of the match - Moussa Sissoko (Tottenham)\nPlayed eight, won eight - the stats\nTottenham have won their past eight Premier League meetings against Crystal Palace\nPalace are winless in their past seven away league games against Spurs (D2 L5), failing to score in their past six.\nAway from Wembley, Tottenham are unbeaten in their past 15 home London derbies in the Premier League (W11 D4), winning each of the past five at White Hart Lane and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nPalace have only won one of their past eight London derbies away from home since the start of last season.\nTottenham forward Son Heung-min has now scored 12 Premier League goals this season; only in 2016-17 (14) has he scored more in a single season in his top-flight league career.\nChristian Eriksen has both scored and assisted in nine Premier League games for Tottenham - more than any other midfielder for the club in the competition.\nEriksen has now assisted 59 goals in his 200 Premier League games - only Cesc Fabregas (66), David Beckham (62), Thierry Henry (61) and Dennis Bergkamp (60) provided more in their first 200 appearances in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham will now start preparing for Tuesday's home Champions League quarter-final first leg with Manchester City (20:00 BST). Palace are back in action on Saturday when they are away at Newcastle in the Premier League (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Stylish Blues brush aside Seagulls\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri says he is \"lucky\" to have so many squad options as a new-look side cruised to Premier League victory over Brighton with three excellent goals.\nOlivier Giroud flicked home Callum Hudson-Odoi's cross before Eden Hazard curled home from the edge of the box from Ruben Loftus-Cheek's pass.\nLoftus-Cheek then scored an excellent 25-yard strike into the top corner to seal victory.\nAll three goals involved players who have played more minutes in the Europa League than the Premier League this season.\n\"After 50 matches it's very difficult to play every three days,\" Sarri told BBC Sport. \"We needed to change. We're lucky because Callum is doing very well. Loftus has no problem with his back for the first time this season. Giroud is in a good period.\"\nThe Blues, who have won their past 10 games against the Seagulls since 1967, move up to fifth in the league.\nNext up for Chris Hughton's Brighton is Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City.\nFollow reaction to the game here\nUnfamiliar Premier League faces stake their claims\nTeenager Hudson-Odoi made his first Premier League start - having already won two caps for England - and showed quick feet to skip by Anthony Knockaert before rolling the ball across the box for Giroud to cleverly finish at the near post.\nGiroud, making his first league start of 2019, is the top scorer in this season's Europa League with nine. This was only his second league goal.\nSarri - who has long resisted calls from Chelsea fans to involve Hudson-Odoi more - now admits the 18-year-old is ready to be a first-team regular.\n\"Callum played very well and defended very well,\" the manager said. \"He has improved during the season a lot. He's ready to play 90 minutes in very important matches.\"\nChelsea side were in control without scoring a second until Hazard popped up. The Belgian, back in the starting line-up after being surprisingly rested against Cardiff on Sunday, ran on to Loftus-Cheek's pass before cutting inside Lewis Dunk and scoring from 16 yards out.\nThree minutes later roles were reversed when Hazard picked out England midfielder Loftus-Cheek who curled a beautiful effort home from long range.\nLoftus-Cheek has scored five Premier League goals this season in only two starts and 16 substitute appearances.\nThe Blues - who have won six out of eight games in all competitions - are now only behind Arsenal and the Champions League places on goal difference.\nOn this form, Sarri - who has been accused of tactical inflexibility all season - could struggle to justify dropping Hudson-Odoi, Loftus-Cheek and Giroud next week.\nBrighton fail to shine in FA Cup warm-up\nThere had been suggestions Hughton could make wholesale changes three days before his side's first FA Cup semi-final in 36 years, but he resisted the urge with only four switches from their defeat by relegation rivals Southampton. Brighton are not safe from drop yet, five points above the bottom three.\nThe manager said before kick-off it was a chance for players to \"stake a claim\" for Wembley, but in truth nobody shone and they were deservedly beaten - although they did defend well in stages.\nThey managed only one shot on target, a long-range effort from Bernardo, with fellow substitute Knockaert - on for the injured Solly March - shooting wide in injury time.\n\"The quality can wear you down,\" said Hughton after the game.\n\"For good periods we were very much in the game. Anthony Knockaert had our best chance of the game late on. It wasn't like we gave up, which is important. I can't fault what the players gave.\"\nMan of the match - Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea)\nMatch stats - Chelsea match Wimbledon's record\nChelsea have won all eight of their league meetings with Brighton, the joint-best 100% win rate against an opponent in English league history (also 8/8 for Wimbledon v Bournemouth).\nBrighton have lost all 10 of their Premier League away games against 'big six' sides, scoring just two goals in those matches.\nHudson-Odoi has been directly involved in nine goals in his nine starts for Chelsea, scoring four and assisting five.\nHe is the youngest player to provide an assist on his first Premier League start for Chelsea (18 years 146 days).\nGiroud has been directly involved in eight goals in his last five starts for Chelsea, scoring six and assisting two.\nHazard has been directly involved in 16 of Chelsea's 32 Premier League goals at Stamford Bridge this season (nine goals, seven assists), over twice that of any other player at the club.\nLoftus-Cheek scored and assisted in a game for the first time ever.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton face City in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final (17:30 BST) as they bid to reach their first final since 1983. Chelsea host West Ham in a Premier League derby next Monday at 20:00 BST."

        "article_text": "Man City 2-0 Cardiff: Champions return to top of Premier League\nManchester City moved back above Liverpool at the top of the Premier League after easing to victory against struggling Cardiff.\nAn eighth successive league win for the defending champions was seldom in doubt and means they lead Jurgen Klopp's team by a point with six games remaining.\nPep Guardiola's side, who are chasing an unprecedented quadruple, know they will finish top if they win their remaining matches but it is unlikely many of them will be as straightforward as this one.\nKevin de Bruyne took just five minutes to open the scoring with his first league goal since 22 December, running on to Aymeric Laporte's pass and squeezing his shot into the roof of the net from a tight angle.\nMore Manchester City possession and chances followed, before Leroy Sane made it 2-0 just before half-time, burying his shot into the bottom corner after a neat chested knock-down from Gabriel Jesus.\nCardiff, who remain five points adrift of safety, barely threatened at the other end and did not register an effort at goal or a touch in the home area until Junior Hoilett had a hopeful shot blocked at the very end of the first half.\nThey did not manage a serious foray forward until Oumar Niasse broke away to force Ederson into a fine save after 85 minutes, while Manchester City continued to pepper Neil Etheridge's goal with shots.\nPhil Foden had two efforts brilliantly stopped by Etheridge as he tried unsuccessfully to mark his first league start with a goal, while Jesus saw an elaborate flick fly wide when it appeared easy to tap the ball home, with his blushes saved by an offside flag.\nDespite failing to add to their tally in the second half, Manchester City's goal difference is now nine better than Liverpool's - although the Reds can replace them at the top if they win at Southampton on Friday.\nCity's squad steps up to secure win\nThe home side's superiority meant they were able to coast through large parts of this game, but they face a punishing schedule if they are to become the first English team to manage a clean sweep across four fronts.\nThey will play twice a week for the rest of April, with their next two tests against Brighton in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday and Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday.\nAll of Manchester City's squad will surely play some part in a the next few weeks, so it must have been reassuring for Guardiola to see some of his lesser-used players in such convincing form here.\nWith Sergio Aguero injured and Raheem Sterling left on the bench, it was left to Jesus to lead the line and although he did not manage a goal himself, his non-stop running frequently opened up spaces for others.\nLike Jesus, Riyad Mahrez has also been short of first-team starts recently. One early misplaced pass brought groans from his side's fans but he continued to look lively and should have had a penalty when he was fouled in the box in the second half.\nFoden forced Etheridge into a fine save and hit the post in the second-half as he looked completely at ease in his surroundings, understandable given his first-team appearances in other competitions, while a fit-again De Bruyne is clearly a huge boost to City's hopes.\nThe only cloud on an otherwise pretty much perfect night was an early injury to Oleksandr Zinchenko, who has made the left-back slot his own since the start of the year.\nCardiff can have no complaints about this result\nHuddersfield and Fulham have already been relegated from the Premier League and Cardiff are fighting to avoid joining them.\nThe Bluebirds did nothing to improve their situation here, but their survival prospects were always going to depend more on how they fare in their next two games - away at Burnley and Brighton, who are two of the three teams immediately above them - than their result against Guardiola's team.\nSeveral key decisions went against the Bluebirds in their defeat by Chelsea on Sunday, bringing a furious reaction from manager Neil Warnock, but on this occasion he cannot argue that his side deserved more than they got.\nTheir attempts to keep the home side out looked doomed to failure from the moment Jesus missed a De Bruyne cross by a matter of millimetres just 30 seconds into the game, and things did not improve much from that point.\nIf Niasse had taken his chance when he ran clear, then the visitors might have made the final five minutes of the game into more of a contest, but Cardiff were clearly second best throughout.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Man City)\n'He is ready' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola to BBC Sport: \"We played really well. We started really well. A magnificent goal from Kevin de Bruyne. Unfortunately we missed a lot of chances; we need to score more goals.\n\"Phil Foden played excellently. He did everything, arriving in the right positions with the right tempo. He always has chances, has a sense of goal. He's ready, we know it, to play any game in any position.\n\"He competes with David Silva, Kevin, [Ilkay] Gundogan, Bernardo [Silva]. He trains incredible.\"\nOn whether Sergio Aguero be fit for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final: \"We will see on Aguero...\"\nCardiff City boss Neil Warnock to BBC Sport: \"I don't think my players could've given us any more. I was disappointed to concede early doors. They move it so quickly, it is difficult.\n\"It would have been interesting if we scored at the end to see how nervous we could have made them, but I have to be pleased.\n\"The first goal - Neil Etheridge played really well - he knew he should've saved it. I shouted to Kevin de Bruyne at half-time: 'Kevin, did you mean that? Tell me the truth.' He said: 'No I didn't.' So I can let Neil off, although he should still save it!\"\nOn Cardiff's survival chances: \"You can afford the odd draw but I think we have to win three at least, add a draw and who knows?\"\nFortress Etihad - the stats\nManchester City have won 23 of their 25 home matches across all competitions in 2018-19 (L2), including 16 of 17 in the Premier League (L1).\nOnly Chelsea in 2004-05 (31 games) and Manchester City last season (30 games) have reached 80 points (assuming three points for a win) in fewer games in English top-flight history than City have this season (32 games).\nCardiff remain the only side in Premier League history to have never won a midweek match (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) in the competition (P11 W0 D3 L8). They have scored just two goals in their 11 such fixtures.\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock has lost all eight of his managerial league matches against the reigning top-flight champions, including six in the Premier League; only Paul Jewell (eight) and Paul Lambert (seven) have a poorer 100% loss rate against reigning champions in the competition.\nOnly Blackburn Rovers (18 in 1994-95) have ever scored more goals in the opening 15 minutes of their games in a single Premier League season than Manchester City have in 2018-19 (17).\nLeroy Sane has had a hand in 24 goals in his past 21 appearances at Etihad Stadium for Manchester City in all competitions (nine goals, 15 assists).\nWith an average age of 25 years and 139 days, Manchester City's starting XI against Cardiff was their youngest in a Premier League match since April 2011 against Sunderland (24 years 341 days).\nPhil Foden (18 years 310 days) was the youngest player to make his first Premier League start for Manchester City since Jose Pozo against Leicester in December 2014 (18 years 273 days), and youngest English player to do so since Daniel Sturridge in January 2008 against Derby (18 years 151 days).\nWhat's next?\nCity head for Wembley for the fourth time this season this weekend to face Brighton (17:30 BST, live on BBC One), having won on all three previous visits - the Community Shield, Spurs in the Premier League and the Carabao Cup final.\nCardiff have the weekend off. They are next in action at Burnley on 13 April (15:00)."

Only Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy have reached the landmark in fewer matches.\nSalah was influential as Liverpool secured three points in injury time against Tottenham in their last outing, and their persistence in the latter stages of matches is no fluke.\nLiverpool have scored 20 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season, more than any other side, and they have also won a league-leading 16 points from losing positions.\nIf the Reds are to deliver a first league title since 1990, their undying spirit at the death could tip the balance in their favour.\nSaints fall away when it matters\nSouthampton remain five points clear of the danger zone but they were poised to claim a surprise point against the title challengers.\nRalph Hasenhuttl has turned the tide since taking charge at St Mary's and the hosts produced a disciplined defensive display to limit a side that has scored 85 goals to just five shots on target.\nVestergaard and Maya Yoshida made 10 clearances apiece, while the latter epitomised the Southampton mentality when he leapt off the ground to block Roberto Firmino's shot with the goal at his mercy.\nHowever, with the game in the balance and Liverpool struggling to carve out many clear-cut opportunities, the home defence backed off and gave Salah the room he needed to strike the decisive blow.\nOn-loan Saints striker Danny Ings, ineligible against his parent club, was replaced in the Southampton line-up by Irishman Long, who was making his first league start since February.\nLong handed his side the perfect start when he also struck his 50th Premier League goal with a cool finish as the visitors started slowly.\nOnly five teams have scored fewer goals than Southampton this season, but with Ings set to return and Long back among the goals, they are well placed to pick up the results needed to stay in the top flight.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\n'The season is intense for everyone' - what they said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: \"I knew it would be difficult. Southampton have been well-organised. We scored two wonderful goals.\n\"The season is intense for everyone. You have an opportunity to make really good changes - Milner and Henderson helped. They were aggressive in a really important way. You could see them pushing the boys.\n\"Southampton had to suffer in the second half because of the first-half tempo. Difficult away game, 3-1 is a perfect result.\n\"What a goal [from Salah]. He couldn't pass because Firmino couldn't get into the right position. The defender could not concentrate on Mo. Wow, what a goal. A good moment. Naby Keita's first goal for the club in a crucial moment.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: \"We saw a very interesting game today. Our team scored very early so it was a long way to the end to get a point or three.\n\"We showed it is not so easy if we have a plan and surprise them and can cause problems against the big teams. They know this, believe in this and the guys showed up.\n\"There was a crucial chance for Shane Long for 2-0 and then it would be very interesting, they were struggling at that point. Then we would have had a chance for a point.\n\"Their first goal was offside and the second we did not react well. We cannot make such a mistake from this position. They have a counter from our shot and it was too easy. We showed in the second half we are brave and we wanted to win the game.\n\"We have to pay attention and not fear the moment. The team believes, that is important, and know now that teams are coming where we must take the points.\"\nSaints throw away another lead - the stats\nSouthampton have only managed to win one of their six Premier League games played on a Friday, suffering defeat in three of their last four (P6 W1 D2 L3).\nLiverpool have beaten Southampton in four successive league games for the first time in the club's history.\nSouthampton have now lost 23 points from leading positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side in 2018-19.\nLiverpool have won five of their last six Premier League games when conceding the opening goal (L1), including tasting victory on each of the last three instances.\nLiverpool became the seventh club in English top-flight history to concede 5,000 goals after Everton, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Sunderland and Arsenal.\nLiverpool's Jordan Henderson is the first Premier League substitute to score a goal, assist a goal and receive a yellow card since Graziano Pelle did so against Crystal Palace in May 2016.\nNaby Keita's goal for Liverpool was his first Premier League goal of the season from his 23rd shot in the competition. He is the third player from Guinea to score in the league after Kamil Zayatte and Titi Camara.\nSouthampton striker Shane Long is the fourth player from the Republic of Ireland to register 50 Premier League goals, along with Niall Quinn (59), Robbie Keane (126) and Damien Duff (54).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host Porto in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, 9 April (20:00 BST), while Southampton are back at St Mary's to face Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday, 13 April (15:00)."

I am very, very proud of the team's performance.\"\nBoth sides had seen goals disallowed in the first half; Salomon Rondon was called offside after bundling home Matt Ritchie's knockdown before James Tomkins fired in from a corner only for the flag to be raised due to James McArthur's offside position.\nThe hosts then lost Florian Lejeune midway through the second period as he was carried off on a stretcher after suffering a nasty knee injury.\nThe victory lifts Palace to 12th while the Magpies drop to 15th, though they are still seven points clear of Cardiff, who currently occupy the final spot in the relegation zone.\nRelive Newcastle 0-1 Crystal Palace\nFollow live reaction to the rest of this afternoon's Premier League games action\nMilivojevic strikes again\nHad Palace beaten Watford last month they would have had an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley to look forward to this weekend. Instead, it was a trip to St James' Park in the Premier League.\nThe hosts dominated for much of the first period and Eagles keeper Vicente Guaita was called into action on a number of occasions to deny Rondon.\nPalace, however, held firm and looked dangerous on the break.\nAnd it was from a lightning counter-attack with which they found the winner as Zaha skipped past Fabian Schar before being fouled by Yedlin. The skipper did the rest from the spot.\nMilivojevic has now scored 11 goals across all competitions this season and, incredibly, 10 of those have come from the spot.\n\"This three points will guarantee [us staying up],\" Milivojevic told Premier League Productions.\n\"Today our game over 90 minutes was very good. We controlled the game in the second half.\n\"This season I have scored a lot [of penalties] which is not easy but we cannot forget the attacking players with a lot of quality and skills [to win the penalties].\"\nWhile it would take an extraordinary run of results to see Palace relegated with the 36 points they held before Saturday's game, they are now just one point off the 40-point mark.\nNewcastle's home run comes to an end\nThe foundations of Newcastle's recent successes have been built on their strong home form, which had seen them string together a five-match winning streak at St James' Park in the league.\nAnd it looked as though the Magpies would carry that good form into Saturday's clash with Palace as they started the better of the teams.\nRitchie tested Guaita early on, however it was Rondon who was their chief threat. The Venezuelan could have scored a hat-trick in the first half alone had his finishing been more precise.\nRafael Benitez's side may feel hard done by as Miguel Almiron, Ayoze Perez and Rondon all spurned chances in the second period.\nBut for all Newcastle's efforts, and their 18 shots, Palace only needed one shot on target to take all three points.\nThe Magpies remain on 35 points having suffered back-to-back defeats for the first time since January.\n\"These are the kind of games that leave you very disappointed. Every game is a final and every game we will try to get three points,\" Benitez told Premier League Productions.\n\"It's a game we can't believe we lost. With the chances we had and the control we had, we made too many mistakes in the last minutes. We had enough chances to win the game.\"\nMan of the match - Luka Milivojevic (Crystal Palace)\n'There's no-one better from the spot' - what they said\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson told Premier League Productions: \"We dealt with Newcastle's attacking threat and it was a sterling effort by the back four and goalkeeper to deal with the balls they whipped into the area.\n\"And on the counter-attack or even at the start of the game, not on the counter-attack, we looked dangerous. We were constantly threatening and looking like we might score.\n\"There's no-one better from the spot [than Luka Milivojevic]. It's great that Luka is doing that and it's the real skill but we have to pay tribute to Wilfried Zaha, who keeps winning these penalties.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez on Match of the Day: \"It's a big disappointment because we had a lot of chances and lots of shots on goal but this is sometimes the kind of game you cannot win but it is important not to lose.\n\"The most difficult one is the final third. We pushed and we attacked but we didn't control the counter-attack the way we should have done.\"\nPalace thrive on the road - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won 59% of their Premier League points away from home this season (23/39), the highest ratio in the division.\nNewcastle are winless in all 11 of their Premier League games against London sides this season, drawing two and losing nine.\nCrystal Palace won despite having just three shots on goal in this match - no side has won a Premier League game with fewer attempts this season.\nNewcastle have lost their last two Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous nine in the competition (W5 D2 L2).\nLuka Milivojevic has scored 10 Premier League penalties for Crystal Palace this season - only Andrew Johnson in 2004-05 (11, also with Crystal Palace) has scored more in a single campaign in the competition.\nMilivojevic has scored 13% of all the penalty goals in the Premier League this season (10/76).\nSalomon Rondon was directly involved in 50% of Newcastle's 18 shots in this match, taking five shots and setting up four.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle now face a trip to King Power Stadium to face Leicester City on Friday night (12 April, 20:00 BST).

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-3 Burnley: Clarets come from behind to boost survival hopes\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe has warned his players they still have work to do to secure top-flight safety as Burnley boosted their own survival hopes with victory at Vitality Stadium.\nThe Cherries, who remain 10 points clear of the bottom three despite the defeat, made the best possible start on the south coast as Ashley Barnes sent a header into his own net under pressure from Nathan Ake.\nBut Sean Dyche's side responded brilliantly, scoring twice in as many first-half minutes to turn the game on its head.\nGoalkeeper Asmir Begovic misjudged Ashley Westwood's corner, allowing Chris Wood to nod into an empty net from point-blank range.\nThe turnaround was complete two minutes later when Westwood converted Chris Mepham's poor clearance, before Barnes atoned for his early own goal by slotting home Wood's cut-back in the second half.\n\"I don't know how many times I've got to say that we're not safe,\" said Howe.\n\"I don't consider myself safe and on my holidays - and the players are the same. Until someone says we're mathematically safe, that will be the case.\n\"You can't take liberties in this game.\"\nThe result lifts Burnley eight points above the relegation zone, two points and one place behind the Cherries.\nBurnley capitalise on poor Cherries defending\nA run of four straight defeats prior to last weekend's 2-0 win over Wolves had left Burnley sliding alarmingly towards the drop zone.\nAnother reverse at Bournemouth would have increased the pressure on Dyche's team before their game with fellow strugglers Cardiff next week, but the Clarets manager could hardly have wished for a better response from his players after such an early setback on the south coast.\nAke would have had a clear sight of goal had Barnes not tried to get a touch to Ryan Fraser's inswinging free-kick, but the Burnley forward could only divert the ball beyond his own keeper Tom Heaton and into the corner of the net.\nThe visitors were gifted a route back into the game when Begovic completely misjudged Westwood's corner, the Bosnian flapping at thin air before Wood directed his downward header into the net.\nBurnley's second was just as poor from a Cherries perspective. Dwight McNeil's low cross should have been easily dealt with by Mepham, but the 21-year-old scuffed his clearance straight to Westwood, whose powerful effort beat Ake on the goalline.\nFor the Clarets' third, Bournemouth appeared to switch off while appealing for a throw-in on the Burnley left and the visitors took full advantage, Wood beating Begovic to a low cross before teeing up Barnes.\nDyche's side could have added a fourth late on, but Ben Mee failed to hit the target with a far-post header.\nBournemouth struggle with Clarets' aerial threat\nHowe, himself a former Burnley boss, has repeatedly stressed that the Cherries are not yet safe from Premier League relegation this season, despite their comfortable cushion over the bottom three.\nIt will take a spectacular collapse for Bournemouth to lose their top-flight status, but Howe will be deeply frustrated with his team's defending after such a promising start.\nAll three of the visitors' goals came from Burnley crosses which should have been comfortably dealt with by the home defence.\nBegovic in particular endured an afternoon to forget, while Mepham also struggled against the physicality of Wood and Barnes.\nThe hosts looked lively at the other end in the first half, with David Brooks firing straight at Heaton from a good position and Callum Wilson sending a header narrowly over the crossbar.\nBut the Cherries were almost non-existent as an attacking threat in the second half as Burnley's defence stood firm to secure the points.\nMan of the match - Chris Wood (Burnley)\nBurnley enjoy visiting the south coast - the stats\nBurnley completed their first league double over Bournemouth since the 1999-2000 season in the third tier.\nBournemouth are only the second side in Premier League history to concede more than 60 goals in four consecutive seasons in the competition, after Wigan between 2009-10 and 2012-13.\nOnly Wolves (four) have scored more Premier League own goals this season than Burnley (three).\nBurnley have scored 40 Premier League goals this season, only in 2009-10 (42) have they netted more in a single campaign in the competition.\nAfter losing their first four such games, Burnley are unbeaten in their last six Premier League matches on the south coast, winning four and drawing two.\nAshley Barnes is the first Burnley player to score at both ends in a Premier League game.\nBurnley's Ashley Westwood both scored and provided an assist in a Premier League game for the first time in his career (181st appearance).\nSince the start of last season, Chris Wood has scored 22 goals in all competitions, more than any other Burnley player.\n'It puts us in a much healthier position' - what the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We were looking at the second half and wanted constant pressure but it didn't happen. Burnley managed their lead well. There were good bits in the first half. The second half was flat. That was the least we expected.\n\"We are still fighting for points. This season is very much alive. We are running out of games now. We need to pick ourselves up.\n\"We will have to look at everything - go back to basics and try and make things right.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"So many parts of the performance were strong today. I know Bournemouth have had a tricky spell in the league, but here they're strong.\n\"There was no nervousness and we stayed clear-minded. We had some real moments of quality too.\n\"24 points since Christmas is a very strong return. The win puts us in a much healthier situation than we were two games ago. We want to finish the season well and the next game is very important.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Brighton on Saturday 13 April (15:00 BST), while Burnley host Cardiff at Turf Moor at the same time."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 1-4 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy scores twice as Leicester climb to seventh\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers described Jamie Vardy as \"one of the best around\" as the striker's double helped the Foxes to a fourth consecutive Premier League win at the expense of relegated Huddersfield.\nYouri Tielemans, on loan from Monaco, broke the deadlock for the Foxes with a clever finish from the edge of the area after Huddersfield failed to clear from a corner.\nVardy doubled the visitors' advantage with his 14th league goal of the season two minutes after half-time, as Ricardo Pereira delivered a perfect low cross to the back post.\nHuddersfield responded quickly with their first penalty of the season, Aaron Mooy converting from the spot after 52 minutes following Caglar Soyuncu's foul on Karlan Grant.\nBut James Maddison added a third for the Foxes with an excellent free-kick before Vardy scored his second from the penalty spot with 84 minutes played.\nOn Vardy, Rodgers said: \"We play a very aggressive game, an attacking game that suits offensive players and obviously he's one of the best around.\n\"It's great to have someone right up there who does not just score the goals but who sets up our press. He works very hard and he's a joy to work with.\"\nThe result sees Leicester climb from ninth to seventh, level on points with Wolves having played a game more.\nHuddersfield v Leicester as it happened\nSaturday's Premier League action\nLeicester's progress under Rodgers continues\nThis was former Celtic manager Rodgers' fifth game in charge of Leicester, yet it is already evident that his players have developed an understanding of the style of football he hopes to implement while at the club.\nThe 46-year-old described his side as \"outstanding\" in their victory over Bournemouth last time out, and despite a slow start to the match, the Foxes once more put in an impressive attacking display.\nTielemans, 21, who has impressed consistently since his January arrival, brought his side to life with a composed opening goal 24 minutes in and Leicester were relentless for the remainder of the match.\nTerriers goalkeeper Ben Hamer was kept busy as Leicester surged for a second before the interval, denying Demarai Gray as Ben Chilwell also went close.\nIn a week when the late Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha would have celebrated his 61st birthday, Rodgers side again hinted at their promise for next season with sweeping counter-attacks as Vardy and Maddison made sure of the points.\nWith Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans absent, only 22-year-old Soyuncu's error for Huddersfield's penalty dampened Leicester's afternoon, while Kasper Schmeichel had to produce a sublime save when called upon to deny Steve Mounie's curling strike.\nIt's another positive step for Leicester, who maintain their hopes of possible Europa League qualification.\n\"The idea is to finish as high as we can. You want to be in Europe if you can. We'll see if we can find a different way to get in there,\" said Rodgers.\n\"If it's this season great. If not, throughout my contract here that was the aim. So far the boys have been absolutely first class.\"\nRelegated Terriers put up fight in front of home crowd\nAfter their \"inevitable\" relegation was confirmed with defeat at Crystal Palace last weekend, the remaining fixtures of Huddersfield's two-year stay in the Premier League must focus solely on building positivity ahead of next season.\nSince Jan Siewart's arrival in January, the Terriers have now lost nine of their ten league games, while there were reports this week\n, external\nthat the former Borussia Dortmund coach's job was already under threat after falling out with senior players.\nThe Terriers, backed by a lively home crowd, made a confident start against Leicester and looked comfortable in possession up until the visitors' opener.\nThey had goalkeeper Hamer to thank on several occasions as they trailed by just the single goal at half-time.\nHowever, they remained short of ideas in attack until the introduction of substitutes Isaac Mbenza and Mounie.\nMbenza almost had an instant impact, creating space down the right before sending an inviting ball into the path of Grant, while Mounie's effort was only kept out by an alert Schmeichel.\nUnderstandably, following the disappointment of relegation, the heads of the Huddersfield players dropped as a clinical Leicester disappeared from view.\nTerriers chairman Dean Hoyle believes his club is \"in its best position in modern memory\" as they prepare for life in the Championship; yet while financial figures released last week showed a club-record profit, both he and Siewart will hope for some improvement on the pitch in their final five top-flight games.\n\"We have to give credit to Leicester, we couldn't beat their quality today, they were much more clinical than we are and we needed too many opportunities,\" said Siewart.\n\"The supporters know the time in the Premier League is time we can take much learning out of. It's about being clinical - this is the crucial thing about being in the Premier League.\"\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nHuddersfield finally get a penalty - the stats\nLeicester have now matched their points tally of 47 from the entire 2017-18 season in their 33 league matches this season.\nThe Foxes have won 10 of their last 11 league games against Huddersfield Town, drawing the other game in September 2017.\nJamie Vardy has scored in each of his last four league games against Huddersfield, registering five goals, including four in three in the Premier League.\nJames Maddison has scored three direct free-kick goals in the Premier League this season, the most by a player in a single campaign since the three scored by Philippe Coutinho in 2016-17.\nYouri Tielemans has either scored or assisted a goal in five of his last six Premier League games for Leicester, scoring in two and assisting in three.\nHuddersfield Town have lost 19 of their last 21 games in all competitions since the beginning of December 2018, winning one and drawing one. That's more defeats than any other side in the top four tiers of English football during that period.\nThis was Huddersfield's 25th Premier League defeat of the season; only in 1987-88 in the second tier have they lost more games in a league campaign, losing 28.\nThe Terriers' penalty was their first in the Premier League this season and the first in the league since February 2018, making them the 20th and final club to win a spot-kick in the competition this season.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Newcastle on Friday, 12 April, (20:00 BST), while Huddersfield travel to face Tottenham next Saturday (12:30 BST)."

We deserved the three points,\" Silva told BBC Sport.\n\"The chances we created, we should score more goals. It is a fantastic win and one more clean sheet. That's the spirit I like - the desire to win every challenge.\n\"[Earlier in the season] we lost some confidence, we had a break and after we worked really well. It's the same team with more confidence.\"\nArsenal were poor in the first half and, while they did improve in the second, they never seriously tested Jordan Pickford in the Toffees goal.\nEverton, meanwhile, had plenty of chances to double their lead in the second half as Bernard, Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson all spurned chances.\nVictory for Everton means they leapfrog Watford into ninth while Arsenal remain in fourth.\nAs it happened: Everton 1-0 Arsenal\nDominant Toffees claim deserved victory\nEverton only announced\n, external\nJagielka was starting 15 minutes before kick-off - a late replacement for Keane who dropped out of the matchday squad due to illness.\nBut it only took the club captain 10 minutes to get on the scoresheet as he capitalised on confusion in the Arsenal box to fire home his first goal since April 2017 from close range.\nThe hosts went on to dominate for much of the first half with Brazilian pair Richarlison and Bernard causing problems as they found plenty of space in behind the Gunners' wing-backs.\nWhile the visitors did improve after the break with the introduction of Aaron Ramsey and Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang, the Toffees were still largely the better side.\nBernard should have doubled his side's lead on 59 minutes when an error by Ainsley Maitland-Niles presented him with a one-on-one with Bernd Leno which the keeper saved well.\nAnd there were more chances for the hosts as the game drew to a close, too, as Sigurdsson could only shoot straight at Leno from Richarlison's cut-back, while the Brazilian skewed his own effort wide with the goal gaping.\nThere were further opportunities for Bernard, Andre Gomes and substitute Theo Walcott as the Toffees piled on the pressure but they could not find a second goal.\nHowever, they were not made to pay for their lack of cutting edge as they claimed a victory which sees them string together three consecutive league wins for only the second time this season and the first since October.\nIn a relatively tame contest, tempers did flair on the touchline late on as Silva and Unai Emery had a heated altercation following a mistimed challenge by Shkodran Mustafi on Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nMesut Ozil, who had been withdrawn shortly before the tackle in question, was also involved as he appeared to throw his coat in Silva's direction.\n\"Football is emotional. He wants the best for his team, I want the best for mine. At the end we spoke together and everything is normal,\" Silva told BBC Sport.\nToothless Arsenal fail to impress\nWhen the Gunners arrived at Goodison Park they were chasing a fourth-straight win across all competitions and they were unbeaten in the league since a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City in early February.\nBut they looked a side devoid of confidence and ideas in the first 45 minutes on Merseyside.\nIn fact, it only took them 10 minutes to continue their unwanted record of being the only Premier League side to not keep an away clean sheet as Jagielka poked in the hosts' eventual winner.\nWith the injured Granit Xhaka missing from Arsenal's midfield, Everton's Andre Gomes was able to dictate the game's tempo, with neither Matteo Guendouzi nor Mohamed Elneny able to impose themselves.\nThe Gunners did improve after the break as Emery changed his side's shape by bringing on a second striker in the form of Aubemeyang, but still they could not find a way to breach the Everton defence.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan went closest with a curling effort from the edge of the box but the fact Pickford only made two saves spoke volumes.\nDespite their defeat Arsenal still currently occupy the final Champions League qualification spot but they could well lose it to Chelsea if Maurizio Sarri's side can beat West Ham on Monday night.\nAnd with a Europa League quarter-final against Napoli on Thursday, and more crucial league games on the horizon, Emery needs to find out what went wrong at Goodison Park and fast.\nMan of the match - Bernard (Everton)\n'We are trying to build momentum' - what they said\nEverton boss Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The fans can be the key for us, we have to give them what they expect. I came to a big club like Everton to give our fans what they deserve. It is a matter of keep working to achieve what we want.\"\nEverton goalscorer Phil Jagielka on Sky Sports: \"It feels great. Obviously, to keep a clean sheet as well. We are trying to build a little bit of momentum. We could have had a few more. Arsenal are a good team and obviously we beat Chelsea as well.\"\nArsenal's struggles away from home continue - the stats\nArsenal have lost seven of their last 11 away matches in all competitions (W2 D2 L7).\nArsenal are one of only two teams in the top four tiers of English league football this season without an away clean sheet this season, along with Championship side Ipswich Town.\nOnly Richard Gough (37y 138d) in August 1999 against Southampton has scored a Premier League goal for Everton at an older age than Phil Jagielka did today (36y 233d).\nEverton's Gylfi Sigurdsson attempted seven shots in this match - as many as the entire Arsenal team combined.\nEverton have won their last two Premier League games against 'big six' opponents - as many as in their previous 41 league games against them (W2 D14 L25).\nOnly Patrick Vieira in 1996-97 and Shkodran Mustafi in 2016-17 (11) have received more yellow cards in a single Premier League season for Arsenal than Sokratis this season (10).\nNext up?\nArsenal are back in European action on Thursday, 11 April when they host Napoli in the Europa League quarter finals (20:00 BST).\nMeanwhile, Everton's next game is away to already-relegated Fulham on Saturday, 13 April (15:00)."

who have a game in hand - after a third successive league win.\nThe Hammers remain 11th after a third defeat in four league games.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge\nWill Hazard be at Chelsea next season?\nOn a day fresh reports circulated\n, external\nabout Hazard moving to Spain's capital, the 28-year-old produced a breathless performance to show why he is one of Europe's best forwards.\nHe was outstanding from start to finish against the West Ham, inspiring his side to an 11th top-flight win at Stamford Bridge this season, and received a standing ovation from Chelsea fans at the final whistle.\nIn the space of a few first-half minutes, Hazard scored his 15th - and arguably best - league goal of the season, produced a wonderful pass which saw Higuain hit a post, and appeared to be fouled by Austria forward Arnautovic inside West Ham's penalty area.\nTo the bewilderment of Hazard and Chelsea, referee Chris Kavanagh waved away the home side's appeals.\nHazard's opening goal was beautiful, the Chelsea player receiving the ball just inside the Hammers' half before using both feet during an unstoppable run which ended with the ball in the net.\nHis second, a powerful low finish, sealed a deserved win for Maurizio Sarri's side.\nHazard's contract expires in the summer of 2020 and Blues fans will hope the club do not cash in on their prize asset after Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane admitted he has \"always appreciated\" the Chelsea player.\nWith the London club hit with a Fifa transfer ban preventing them from signing players until the end of January 2020, Chelsea would have to wait to spend any money if they did decide to sell Hazard -

It's an area we will get better at. There wasn't a lot in the game, our final pass just wasn't there but we gave everything. We couldn't break down their defence.\n\"We will learn from it; this is why I am here. In games like that, you have to stay patient and have tactical discipline. The players have been first class since I came here but if you're not quite on it, a result like this can happen.\n\"The speed of our passing in particular can be much better. We let them get into shape too early. It needs to come quicker. We changed it around a few times but it was one of those evenings. It will be good for our learning going forward.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez said: \"It was a good game against a good team. We did very well. Our players worked so hard. This relationship between the players and fans means a lot to us. The players and fans tried to do their best.\n\"As a coach, you always have a game plan. You can prepare however you want but it depends on the players to make the difference.\n\"The problem against James Maddison or Jamie Vardy is you have to concentrate from the first minute to the last. We are really pleased with the clean sheet and three points. You have to enjoy today and be ready for the next one.\n\"We had two or three counter-attacks that we could have had a little more composure and scored more.\"\nA happy hunting ground for the Magpies - the stats\nNewcastle have won back-to-back league visits to Leicester in the top flight for the first time since September 1959 under manager Charlie Mitten.\nThis was Leicester City's eighth home league defeat of the campaign, their most in a Premier League season at the King Power Stadium since it opened in 2002. Only in 1994-95 (10) and 2001-02 (9) have they lost more home Premier League games in a single season.\nNewcastle have now picked up 16 points away from home in the Premier League this season (P17 W3 D7 L7), as many as they earned in the whole of the 2017-18 campaign on the road.\nLeicester City completed 649 passes in this match, their highest total in a Premier League game since 2003-04 (when Opta began recording this data); indeed, three of their four highest successful pass tallies in this time in the division have been recorded in their six fixtures under Brendan Rodgers.\nAyoze Perez has been directly involved in four of Newcastle's past six league goals (three goals, one assist), scoring three of their last five.\nSince his debut for Newcastle at the start of the 2016-17 Championship season, Matt Ritchie has assisted 17 league goals for the club, at least four more than any other player in that time.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to West Ham on Saturday, 20 April (15:00 BST), while Newcastle host Southampton in the evening of the same day (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 4-0 Huddersfield: Spurs go third with win over Terriers\nLucas Moura scored a brilliant hat-trick as Tottenham cruised past relegated Huddersfield and moved above Chelsea into third in the Premier League.\nA much-changed Spurs side dominated from the off at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and deservedly went ahead when Victor Wanyama danced around Ben Hamer and slotted home midway through the first half.\nMoura added their second just 144 seconds later as he rifled a low shot past Hamer after being played in by Moussa Sissoko.\nThe Brazilian was on the scoresheet again three minutes from time as he controlled and volleyed home Christian Eriksen's cross.\nAnd he completed his hat-trick deep into injury time with another emphatic finish past Hamer.\nChristian Eriksen and Fernando Llorente had earlier hit the woodwork for Spurs as they piled on the pressure, although Hugo Lloris was called into action late on to tip a Leandro Bacuna free-kick on to the crossbar.\nHuddersfield remain bottom and have now lost six consecutive league games.\nAs it happened: Tottenham 4-0 Huddersfield\nNo Kane, no problem\nWith one eye firmly on Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Manchester City, Pochettino made seven changes to the starting XI that beat City 1-0 in the first leg.\nInjured trio Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Harry Winks all dropped out of the squad, while in-form Son Heung-min was named among the substitutes, leaving Llorente and Moura to lead the line alongside Eriksen.\nSpurs' new-look front three were impressive; Llorente helped create the first by holding off his marker to make the space for Wanyama to run into, while Eriksen was his influential self and Moura stole the show.\nThe Brazilian produced two superb finishes for his first and third while he displayed impressive skill to control Eriksen's cross for the second.\nIt remains to be seen who Pochettino will pick to start at Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, and Son will almost certainly return, but Moura has certainly done his chances no harm.\nAnd on this evidence, Pochettino has plenty of players to hurt City, even without talisman Kane.\nSpurs back on track in league\nTottenham's league form had faltered recently with only four points gained from their previous six league games.\nBut they have now strung together back-to-back league wins for the first time since early February, having beaten Crystal Palace and Huddersfield at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nThe hosts had 88% of the possession in the opening 15 minutes and that set the tone for a comfortable afternoon for Pochettino's men.\nThe Terriers failed to get a shot on target in the first half and did little better in the second, meaning Spurs' makeshift back five were rarely tested.\nAt the other end, Llorente failed to convert a host of chances as Spurs played through Huddersfield at will to claim arguably their easiest three points of the season.\nSpurs sit third for now but they will drop to fourth if Chelsea beat Liverpool on Sunday while Arsenal and Manchester United remain hot on their heels.\nAnd with Champions League opponents Manchester City next up for Pochettino's side in the league too, a place in the top four is far from a foregone conclusion.\nHuddersfield fail to score again\nThere were few envious eyes cast towards Jan Siewert when he was appointed Huddersfield manager in January with the Terriers bottom of the Premier League and 10 points from safety.\nThey were 10 games without a league win when he arrived and it took them a further four games to find one - and that 1-0 victory over Wolves remains Siewert's only league win as Terriers boss.\nOn Saturday, the Terriers were devoid of confidence or ideas in the first half and, while they did improve in the second half, they could not produce a goal, which is a common problem for Siewert's side.\nHuddersfield have found the net only 19 times this season, meaning they are still one short of Derby County's record for the fewest goals scored in a Premier League campaign (2007-08).\nThe Terriers will already have begun their preparations for life in the Championship next season, and solving their goalscoring problem is sure to be high on Siewert's list of priorities.\nMan of the match - Lucas Moura (Tottenham)\n'It's fantastic to play here' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told Match of the Day: \"I am so pleased. Football is about the squad, the collective. Of course we had some injuries after Manchester City like Alli and Kane, and we were forced to make changes and we needed to provide fresh legs and it's good because we have a tough period ahead and the performance was very professional.\n\"It's always important to open the game and score in the first half to give belief and confidence. After a few minutes we score the second goal and lift the stadium and fans - it's fantastic to play here and gives the players fantastic energy and belief.\"\nHuddersfield manager Jan Siewert told Match of the Day: \"Four goals are too much today - that doesn't reflect how we played.\n\"The lads are better than the points are showing at the moment - that's my message. It's still about this season, to represent us the best we can until the end of the season.\"\nTottenham win without Kane again - the stats\nTottenham have won all five of their Premier League games this season without Harry Kane.\nSpurs have won their first four Premier League games against Huddersfield without conceding a goal, something they had only previously done against Cardiff.\nHuddersfield have lost 26 of their 34 games in the Premier League this season, the joint highest number of defeats at this stage of the season in the competition (level with Sunderland in 2005-06).\nWith seven goals and five assists in 853 minutes of action, Tottenham's Fernando Llorente has registered the best minutes per goal involvement rate of any Tottenham player this season in all competitions (71.1).\nHuddersfield's Ben Hamer has conceded 21 goals in seven Premier League appearances this season, at a rate of one every 26.3 minutes, the worst rate of any keeper this season to play more than one game.\nTottenham's Christian Eriksen registered his 60th Premier League assist, eight more than any other player since his debut in the competition in September 2013.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to Manchester City on Wednesday where they will attempt to book their place in the Champions League semi-finals (20:00 BST). Then, they face the same opponents again, at the same venue, three days later in the Premier League (Saturday, 20 April, 12:30 BST).\nHuddersfield host Watford in the league later that day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Fulham 2-0 Everton: Ryan Babel and Tom Cairney earn Cottagers win\nFulham midfielder Tom Cairney says \"it's a given\" Scott Parker will get the manager's job permanently after securing his first win in caretaker charge against Everton.\nCairney and Ryan Babel were on target for the relegated Cottagers, ending a run of nine successive defeats with their first Premier League win since January.\nFive of those defeats have come under Parker, who succeeded Claudio Ranieri at the start of last month.\n\"Ever since Scott Parker was put in charge it has been a step in the right direction. It has been hard to get a win. But the performance has improved,\" said Cairney.\n\"You can see the way the players play for him, the way they respond. If there has been that improvement in four or five weeks it's a given [he will get the job].\"\nFulham opened the scoring 30 seconds into the second half at Craven Cottage when Cairney stroked home Babel's pass from just inside the area for his first goal of the season. Babel then ran on to Aleksandar Mitrovic's pass to double Fulham's lead.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin had Everton's best chance but his clipped effort hit the outside of the post, as the Toffees' three-game winning run came to an end.\nIt was a deserved victory for Fulham, who kept just their third clean sheet of the season and first since December.\nMitrovic was a constant threat and had the best chance of a quiet first half, but his shot from inside the area hit the top of the bar.\nEverton offered little in reply, with Bernard's tame first-half effort their only shot on target.\nThe defeat means Marco Silva's side stay ninth and miss the chance to move above Watford and Wolves into seventh.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive how Fulham beat Everton\nFulham offer hope for the future\nFulham caretaker boss Parker said before the game that he was planning for the future with the Cottagers' relegation already confirmed, even with his own position uncertain.\nThe former England midfielder must have been hugely encouraged by a dominant performance from his side.\nFulham have the worst defensive record in the division but comfortably held Everton at bay to keep a rare clean sheet, while they threatened in attack throughout the game.\nTheir display was perhaps summed up by an all-action performance from Mitrovic, who gave Everton defenders Phil Jagielka and Kurt Zouma a torrid afternoon.\nThe Serbian had seven efforts on goal in the first half alone, drawing a smart stop from Jordan Pickford before smacking the bar with a shot just inside the area shortly before the break.\nCairney, one of Fulham's best players when they were promoted from the Championship last season, also stood out and was perfectly placed to meet Babel's pass to score the opener.\nMitrovic then showed great awareness to clip a pass through to former Liverpool forward Babel, who raced away from Seamus Coleman before calmly lofting the ball over Pickford.\nThe question for Parker is whether Fulham can keep the likes of Mitrovic, Cairney and Babel when in the Championship next season.\nIf a number of senior players are sold then opportunities may open up for the likes of Harvey Elliott. The midfielder was named on the bench at just 16 years and nine days old and may get a run in the next few weeks as Parker looks towards next season.\nEverton's good run brought to end\nEverton went into this game on the back of three successive wins without conceding a goal to reignite hopes of qualifying for Europe.\nBut the Merseysiders saw that momentum brought to a shuddering halt with a timid display, with boss Silva left to rue his side's inconsistency.\nThe Toffees rarely threatened during the first half, with their best chance coming from a Seamus Coleman cross that just evaded the diving Calvert-Lewin.\nWhatever Silva said at half-time was then rendered redundant within 30 seconds of the restart, with the Toffees never really threatening a comeback.\nCalvert-Lewin came closest to an equaliser when he ran on to Gylfi Sigurdsson's neat reverse pass, but his flicked finish could only hit the outside of post with Rico beaten.\nDespite the defeat Everton remain in the hunt for seventh place, which could yet yield a Europa League spot if Manchester City beat Watford to win the FA Cup.\nSilva may now be wondering which Everton side will turn up when Manchester United arrive at Goodison Park next weekend.\nMan of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham)\n'This has to be standard for rest of season' - what they said\nFulham caretaker manager Scott Parker to BBC Sport: \"We were fantastic from start to finish. We showed a real quality in the way we played and showed grit, That was something I drummed on about, our naivety. We have worked hard over the last 10 days. To a man we were fantastic.\n\"We have let in a number of goals, which has let us down. A clean sheet was pleasing but most important thing was way we played with the ball. As a team we produced some good stuff.\n\"Ryan Babel is a player that can get you off your seat, he has done that today at times. He showed composure and skill to produce another wonderful finish. Tom Cairney was the catalyst to what we did.\n\"Relegation brings uncertainty and doubt. The mainstay are the fans. We have a duty to them and ourselves to put in a performance today and exemplify how good this squad can be. With four games left this has to be the standard.\"\nEverton boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport: \"It was a disappointing result, we did not perform in the way we want. You have to do more and better because we have the quality to do that.\n\"The first half we did not play really fast and create problems. It was not a good first half. Then we start the second half and they score. We were not aggressive enough.\n\"We had a good chance to change the game, Dominic Calvert-Lewin had a one-on-one. But we didn't score, after that it was not a good game for us. They were more aggressive than us, faster and created problems.\"\nFulham end losing run - the stats\nFulham recorded their first Premier League win in 10 games, having lost the previous nine fixtures.\nAll five of Fulham's Premier League victories this season have come at Craven Cottage, with this their first since beating Brighton in January.\nEverton have won just one of their past 12 Premier League away games in London (D3 L8).\nFulham's Tom Cairney scored his first Premier League goal since netting versus Everton in March 2010 for Hull - 3,324 days ago.\nSince his debut in January, Ryan Babel has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Fulham player (four goals, three assists).\nIn his 103rd appearance in the competition, Babel both scored and assisted in a Premier League match for the first time.\nWhat's next?\nFulham travel to the south coast to take on Bournemouth on Saturday, 20 April (15:00 BST). Everton host Manchester United at Goodison Park the following day (13:30 BST)."

Since then, wins over the likes of Arsenal, Everton, Leicester and Tottenham have seen his rejuvenated side steadily ease away from the mire.\nWhat Southampton fans will also be pleased by is their new manager's style of play, which is far more cavalier than the approach adopted by predecessor Mark Hughes.\nForward Redmond is one player who appears to be revelling in it. Having not scored until Hasenhuttl took the reins, he has now netted seven times.\nHis two finishes were those of a confident player. The first was instinctive and the second was well improvised after Patricio tried to close down the space.\nIf he continues this rich form into next season then perhaps Redmond might find himself with a regular spot in Gareth Southgate's England side having been a stalwart at youth level.\nBoth Sims, 22, who was on loan at Reading this season, and fellow forward Danny Ings also impressed in an excellent attacking display.\nWolves fail to fire\nAs for Wolves, they could still finish seventh which would be the highest-placed finish by a newly-promoted team to the Premier League since Ipswich came fifth in the 2000-01 season.\nDespite going behind early on, there appeared to be no hangover from last week's FA Cup semi-final defeat as they began to control possession.\nTheir equaliser, courtesy of Boly's header, was deserved following a spell of heavy pressure, but a lapse in concentration at the back meant they were behind once again only two minutes later.\nWhat will be disappointing for manager Nuno Espirito Santo is that his players failed to trouble Saints keeper Angus Gunn.\nThis season's top scorer Raul Jimenez should have, but he was guilty of a woeful volley from eight yards out.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond (Southampton)\n'The second half was poor' - match reaction\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"Our defensive structure was not the best - it is something that we have to look at.\n\"After we conceded the opener we controlled the game well and made chances until we drew level. We then went behind and were not able to stand up again and the second half was poor.\n\"We left too many spaces and we allowed them to play. Today they were better than us and we have to regroup and bounce back immediately. Our trip to Spain was planned before and we feel it is a good moment to have an opportunity to train and be together.\"\nRedmond's goal quickest since Van Dijk - the stats\nSouthampton have won eight of their 18 Premier League games under Ralph Hassenhuttl, as many as they had won in 52 games under their two previous permanent managers combined (Mark Hughes managed three from 22 and Mauricio Pellegrino managed five from 30).\nWolves are winless in their last five Premier League away games (D2 L3), and have lost back-to-back league games on the road for the first time this season.\nSouthampton have won six of their 13 Premier League games so far in 2019, as many as they had won in the whole of 2018 (P37 W6 D13 L18).\nWolves have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last 13 Premier League away games - only Arsenal (15) have had, and are currently enduring, a longer such run in the competition this season.\nRedmond's opener after a minute and 34 seconds was Southampton's quickest in a Premier League game since December 2016, when Virgil van Dijk netted after 1min 9secs seconds against Tottenham.\nThere were just 118 seconds between Boly's equaliser and Redmond restoring Southampton's lead.\nRedmond scored just his second Premier League brace and his first since March 2017 against Watford.\nLong has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since May 2016.\nWhat's next?\nThe Saints are at Newcastle next Saturday (17:30 BST) and Wolves host Brighton on the same day (15:00 BST)."

I'm so gutted for my players.\n\"I think Darren made the right decision and Mike has talked him out of it.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche defended Dean for making a \"big call\".\n\"I was thinking it's impossible the linesman could give it from there,\" said Dyche after his side's third straight league win.\n\"I think the referee officiated it very well - there's nothing deliberate and the referee has done well to make a big call.\"\nIn an incident-packed game, Burnley's Ashley Barnes was booked for kissing Joe Bennett on the nose after an overzealous challenge by the Cardiff defender.\nTime running out after cruel defeat\nCardiff can still mathematically stay up but Warnock's side are running out of time to save themselves from an immediate return to the Championship.\nWarnock looked dejected at the final whistle after another game in which the match officials failed to endear themselves to him.\nHaving lost from a winning position against Chelsea last month when Cesar Azpilicueta headed in an equaliser from a clearly offside position, Cardiff were again on the end of a controversial decision.\nThey were initially awarded a penalty for handball when Mee headed against his own arm but, after Dean spoke to his assistant, the decision was overturned.\nThe visitors had further penalty appeals turned down including one when Aron Gunnarsson went down under a challenge by Charlie Taylor.\nYet their lack of firepower again contributed to a 21st top-flight defeat of the season.\nWith Burnley leading 1-0, Junior Hoilett sent his side's best chance over the bar as the Bluebirds, who have scored just 28 goals league goals this season, failed to score for the 15th time in 33 games.\nCardiff, who face fellow strugglers Brighton on Tuesday, still have to face title-chasing Liverpool and top-four hopefuls Manchester United.\nHaving lost three in a row, it will require a monumental effort to avoid joining Fulham and Huddersfield in the Championship.\nFourth straight top-flight season in view for Clarets\nBurnley are all but safe after pulling 11 points clear of Cardiff.\nHaving taken over with the club 14th in the Championship in October 2012, boss Dyche can start planning for a fourth successive season in the Premier League.\nThis was never going to be a game that was pleasing on the eye but the Clarets were the better team.\nAlthough Wood got the goals, 19-year-old Dwight McNeil had another eye-catching game and provided the assist for the opening goal.\nTaylor was also strong at the back as the Clarets produced only a fifth clean sheet at home.\nBurnley, should have been out of sight by half-time, Ashley Westwood missing two excellent chances when clean through while Wood, before he scored, headed against a post.\nWhile Barnes rarely looked like scoring, his first-half booking for a kiss produced one of the more bizarre moments of the season.\nMan of the match - Charlie Taylor (Burnley)\nAnother win for Dyche against Warnock - the stats\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche has never lost against Neil Warnock, winning five of his six matches against the Cardiff boss.\nThe Clarets have won three consecutive top-flight games by a margin of two goals for the first time since October 1968.\nBurnley have scored in 12 consecutive home league games for the first time since November 2013 (12 in total in that run).\nSince the start of last season, Chris Wood has scored more Premier League goals for Burnley than any other player (20).\nWood has been directly involved in four goals in his past two Premier League games (3 goals, 1 assist), as many as he managed in his previous 11.\nNo player has been involved in more Premier League goals this season as a teenager than Burnley's Dwight McNeil (3 goals and 5 assists, level with Fulham's Ryan Sessegnon).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley have more than a week to prepare for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on 22 April (20:00 BST kick-off).

The fear is - it could have been worse,\" said Hughton.\nThe Seagulls are five points above next-placed Cardiff, who visit the Amex on Tuesday, 16 April.\nRelive the action from the Amex\nSaturday's Premier League reaction\n\"I think it was one of the poorest performances since I've been here,\" added Hughton, who took over at Brighton when the club were near the foot of the Championship in December 2014.\nBournemouth climb into 12th in the table, and with 41 points they are close to securing their place in the Premier League for a fifth season.\nThe Cherries won for only the fourth time away from home this season, with their other victories on the road coming at Watford and relegated Huddersfield and Fulham.\nBrighton did not get an effort on target until the 91st minute, when Bernardo's header was easily saved by Artur Boruc.\nReality bites for Brighton\nIf Brighton's run to the last four of the FA Cup had taken their minds off their league position for a short while, this performance and result will have brought reality crashing back.\nNot even being on home turf would have brought much solace, with just six wins and only 17 goals scored in 15 league outings at the Amex this season prior to kick-off.\nBut while Brighton won plaudits for their resilience against Manchester City at Wembley last time out, manager Chris Hughton saw his side give Bournemouth time and space to repeatedly cut through their defence even when they still had 11 players on the pitch.\nHughton was furious when Gosling was given the time to line up Bournemouth's first, but the way he blanked Knockaert as the French midfielder walked into the tunnel following his red card also spoke volumes for what the Seagulls boss now has to contend with.\nThe collapse in morale both on the field and in the stands following Knockaert's dismissal means that Cardiff's visit on Tuesday, with the Welsh club five points behind, now takes on even more significance.\nBournemouth impress to almost secure safety\nBournemouth started the match 10 points and four places above the relegation zone, but for manager Eddie Howe this was not a position of safety.\nDefeat at home by Burnley a week earlier prompted Howe to state his side \"could not take any liberties\" following the result, the latest in a poor run of one league win in nine since the start of February.\nBut after soaking up what little Brighton had to offer in the first 30 minutes, Howe's side took control when a slick exchange of passes between Gosling and Wilson ended with Gosling scoring his first goal in over a year.\nFraser on Arsenal, Aberdeen and a dog called Maisie\nFraser's seventh goal of this season had a touch of luck, with the Scot slipping over as he shot from outside the penalty area to make it 2-0 to Bournemouth.\nThe impressive Fraser helped put the result beyond any doubt with key contributions in the build-up to Brooks' and Wilson's goals.\nStanislas' clincher in stoppage time gave Bournemouth their biggest-ever away win in nearly four full seasons in the Premier League.\nMan of the match - Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth)\nWhat the managers said\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"We came up against a very dynamic Bournemouth side and couldn't handle them.\n\"We are in a fight at the moment. Our form is very up and down. This was on the back of a very good performance last week. We have to show our character on Tuesday. Once the players cross that line it's only them who can do that.\"\nOn Anthony Knockaert's red card: \"It was a reckless challenge. It was the right decision. I've spoken to the team and I think it was one of the poorest performances since I've been here. Especially knowing the qualities of the team we were playing against.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"The frustrating thing for us is finding that consistency. We attacked with devastating intent at times. It's a really good win but the longer term thing is finding that consistency.\n\"We're pleased with some of the goals we scored today. We countered with devastating effect in the second half so I'm really pleased.\n\"We restricted them to only a few chances and we know if we can do that to teams then we can hurt them.\n\"We've been hesitating and spluttering in recent weeks so it's good to get back into the groove and show what we can do.\"\nFraser and Wilson are the dynamic duo - the stats you need to know\nBournemouth's Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson have combined for 11 Premier League goals this season, the most by a duo in a single campaign since Alan Shearer and Mike Newell in 1995-96 (also 11).\nBrighton have lost consecutive home games in the Premier League for the first time ever.\nBournemouth are unbeaten in their last 10 league games against Brighton, winning six and drawing four.\nBrighton have lost at home in the league by a 5+ goal margin for the first time since a 2-8 defeat against Bristol Rovers in the third tier in December 1973.\nSince promotion to the Premier League ahead of 2015/16, Bournemouth have seen their opponents receive 16 red cards, more than any other side in that period.\nBournemouth's Callum Wilson has been involved in five goals in his three league appearances against Brighton at the Amex stadium, netting three and assisting two.\nBournemouth winger Ryan Fraser has scored seven and assisted 12 goals in the Premier League this season, the most goal involvements by a Scottish player in a single campaign since Charlie Adam in 2010/11 (20).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton face fellow strugglers Cardiff at home on Tuesday, 16 April, with a 19:45 BST kick-off.

        "article_text": "Man Utd 2-1 West Ham: Paul Pogba scores two penalties in laboured win\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini said he is \"sure\" his side would have beaten Manchester United at Old Trafford had VAR been in place.\nAn under-par United won thanks to two Paul Pogba penalties, returning to winning ways after back-to-back defeats.\nBut the decision to award United their first penalty - when Robert Snodgrass was deemed to have fouled Juan Mata - was contentious, and West Ham should have taken the lead in the ninth minute but Felipe Anderson's goal was incorrectly ruled out for offside.\nPellegrini also said United's second penalty should not have stood because Anthony Martial, who was fouled by Ryan Fredericks, was offside in the build-up - although replays seemed to show he was onside.\n\"I am not complaining about the referee because they were not big mistakes, difficult mistakes, but with technology we have a different score,\" Pellegrini said.\n\"With VAR, I am sure we would win the game 1-0.\n\"Felipe Anderson was onside. It was not a penalty from Robert. The last goal from Man Utd was offside, the last pass.\"\nThe Hammers deservedly equalised through Anderson shortly after half-time, when he converted Manuel Lanzini's cross at the back post and Michail Antonio twice came close to putting Pellegrini's side 2-1 in front.\nFirst he smashed a shot from the edge of the box off the crossbar and minutes later had a header excellently saved by David de Gea.\nUnited manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted his side \"got away with it\".\n\"They played better than us, it is fair to say, I don't think anyone will disagree,\" he added.\n\"Sometimes you get more than you deserve and today is one of those nights.\"\nThe win sees United climb to fifth, two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea who play Liverpool on Sunday, while West Ham stay 11th.\nReaction to Man Utd v West Ham\nFortune favours Man Utd in important win\nWith the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona to come on Tuesday, Solskjaer made five changes to his team and for much of the game they lacked fluidity, giving the ball away repeatedly in the first half in particular.\nThey should have fallen behind early when replays showed Diogo Dalot played Anderson onside.\nFor the first penalty, Snodgrass rushed back to prevent Mata shooting from the edge of the penalty area and did not get to the ball with his challenge. But there was to be little contact with the Spaniard either, who appeared to kick his own heel as he went down.\nWest Ham were the better side in the first half and overcame a good United spell following the introduction of Marcus Rashford, to shade the second.\nHad Antonio put away either of his chances then few would have argued the Hammers deserved to lead.\nThere was little doubt around the foul for United's second penalty, when Martial got in behind the defence and Fredericks brought him down when making a last-ditch attempt to deny the Frenchman a shot.\nPellegrini, however, complained that Martial was offside because he ran on to a flick by Rashford - but replays did not show any touch by the England international, meaning Martial was onside from the original pass.\nPogba calmly converted the penalty, as he had done with the first, to ensure United won for just the second time in their past six games.\nWith Barcelona to come on Tuesday and Premier League games against Everton, Manchester City and Chelsea to follow, it could prove to be an important victory in the race for the top four.\n\"[We were] lucky it wasn't Barcelona but West Ham played well, played better than us,\" Solskjaer said.\n\"We have one of the best goalkeepers in the world. That save is unbelievable.\n\"He won us the game because at 2-1 we would have struggled to create enough.\n\"We got away with it, got three points. In a few years no-one will remember how we played if we finished in the top four.\"\nWest Ham's good work to no avail\nWest Ham's inconsistency has held them back this season, with wins over Manchester United and Arsenal earlier in the season often followed by poor performances like those in their three defeats in their past four games.\nAt Old Trafford on Saturday they impressed with Declan Rice excellent in midfield, and Anderson and Lanzini threatening in attack.\nLanzini, who has been restricted to just six starts this season due to injury, went off with what appeared to be a groin problem in the second half, but the introduction of Antonio almost immediately paid off.\nPellegrini furiously protested at the disallowed goal and the penalty decision in the first half. His side, who are in 11th place with 42 points, were unfortunate.\nHe must, however, take pride in the performance despite a third successive defeat.\n\"We had the possession and the chances of the game but you need a bit of luck to win the games,\" the Chilean said.\n\"It is more difficult to finish in the European places but my target is to finish as high as we can and we will fight to the last day to achieve that.\n\"Playing like we did today will make it easier.\n\"It was a pleasure to see the team playing the way we did against Man Utd in their own stadium.\"\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\nPogba's best season - the key stats\nManchester United are unbeaten in 14 Premier League home games (W9 D5) since a 3-0 loss against Spurs in August. Only Liverpool (37) and Arsenal (16) are currently on longer unbeaten runs at home in the competition.\nWest Ham are winless in their last eight Premier League away games (D1 L7), losing the last four in a row.\nUnited are unbeaten in their last 11 Premier League home games against West Ham - among current Premier League sides, they are only currently on a longer such run against Arsenal (12).\nUnited have won a league-high 12 Premier League penalties this season. Indeed, it's also the most the Red Devils have ever taken in a single campaign in the competition.\nWest Ham had 18 shots in this match, their most in a Premier League away game since December 2016 (24 vs Leicester).\nPaul Pogba has scored seven Premier League penalties this season - only Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2002-03 (8) has scored more from the spot for United in a single season.\nPogba has been directly involved in 22 Premier League goals this season (13 goals, 9 assists), his best return in a single campaign in the top five European leagues.\nFelipe Anderson scored his first Premier League goal in 14 games, becoming the first West Ham player to score home and away against United in the same league season since Jermain Defoe in 2001-02.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to Barcelona for their Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday (kick-off 20:00 BST), looking to overturn their 1-0 first-leg deficit.\nTheir next league game is away against Everton on Sunday, 21 April at 13:30.\nWest Ham host Leicester in their next game on Saturday, 20 April (kick-off 15:00)."

Why not trust the guys to do it again. We have the personality for the games.\n\"I knew we would produce a good performance.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"We got better as the game went on and in the second half we gave it a good shot.\n\"When you go on the counter-attack looking for an equaliser you concede a goal. We weren't good enough to dent City's progress.\n\"Keeping a ball and stopping them from playing around you... we did the best job we could. Had we gone hell for leather then they would have gone behind and around us.\"\nCapital investment for City - the stats\nManchester City have won five away Premier League games against London sides this season, their highest ever number of victories in the capital within a single top-flight campaign.\nCrystal Palace have lost 17 times in the Premier League this season, the joint-most defeats within a single campaign in the competition for a Roy Hodgson side alongside the 2011-12 season when he was in charge of West Brom.\nPalace captain Luka Milivojevic is the first player this season to score both home and away in the Premier League against City.\nRaheem Sterling's brace for City was his first ever double away from home for the club.\nKevin de Bruyne's assist for City's opening goal was his first in the Premier League in 336 days.\nGabriel Jesus has scored 19 goals for Manchester City in all competitions this season, averaging a goal every 112 minutes.\nWhat's next?\nPalace have a week to dust themselves down and prepare for next Sunday's London derby at Arsenal (16:00 BST kick-off) while City will attempt to overturn a 1-0 deficit against Tottenham on Wednesday in the Champions League quarter-final return leg at Etihad Stadium (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-0 Chelsea: Mohamed Salah scores a stunning goal as Reds reclaim lead\nMohamed Salah's wonder-strike helped Liverpool beat Chelsea and ensured they remain two points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League.\nAlmost five years since Liverpool's title chances were ruined by a 2-0 defeat in the same fixture, the hosts kept themselves in the hunt for a first league title in 29 years with two goals in the space of two minutes that saw Anfield erupt.\nAfter a nervy first half in which both sides had chances, Liverpool emerged from the break with added purpose and took the lead via Sadio Mane's header.\nThere was a huge sense of relief inside the ground, but that became a deafening roar when Salah smashed a left-footed angled drive into the top right corner from 25 yards for his 19th Premier League goal of the season.\nAnalysis: How De Bruyne and Salah showed class is permanent\nFootball Daily podcast: Who does Fergie fancy for title?\n'We can't drop points' insist Klopp and Guardiola\nReaction from Anfield\nChelsea, who had been unbeaten at Anfield since 2012, almost hit back six minutes later when Eden Hazard shot against the post before the Belgian saw another effort saved by goalkeeper Alisson.\nBut Liverpool could have extended their lead before an exultant Kop greeted the final whistle with roars of delight and Jurgen Klopp punched the air after his 200th game in charge.\nManchester City, 3-1 winners at Crystal Palace in Sunday's other match, still have a game in hand on the Reds, but with games at home to Tottenham and away to Manchester United among their five remaining fixtures, their task looks tougher than the one facing Liverpool, who meet Cardiff, Huddersfield, Newcastle and Wolves.\nChelsea remain fourth, a point behind Tottenham, who have a game in hand on their London rivals. Maurizio Sarri's side could also be overtaken by sixth-placed Arsenal, who are three points behind them, when they face Watford on Monday.\nSalah strikes back against former employers\nSalah, who played for Chelsea when they beat Liverpool in that infamous game in 2014, was the hosts' most dangerous outlet, and could have given them an early lead when his back-post volley was well saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nThe Egyptian, who was cheered even more loudly than usual by the Kop after being the subject of discriminatory abuse in a video posted by Chelsea fans last week, also squared to Mane seven minutes before half-time but the Senegalese forward curled wide from 10 yards out.\nIt looked like it might be a frustrating afternoon for Salah, who was well marshalled by Chelsea left-back Emerson in the first half. But Liverpool's talisman showed his tenacity to win the ball back before Jordan Henderson clipped across the six-yard box to find Mane for the game's opener.\nAnd the shot that doubled the hosts' lead will live long in the memory as one of Anfield's great goals. Not only was it sublime in its execution, but it was hugely significant in the title race, showing Liverpool are not the same side as five years ago.\nComing on the day the club marked the 30th anniversary of Hillsborough, the victory gave home fans a huge lift on an emotional afternoon.\nChelsea's away woes continue\nDespite their long unbeaten run at Anfield, the defeat continued Chelsea's poor run of form away from Stamford Bridge this season under Sarri. They have now lost seven away games this season.\nAfter defending resolutely in the first half, the game could have swung their way had Willian not skewed wide from a quick attack and Hazard done better from a tight angle before the break.\nBut as in their 2-0 defeat at Everton last month, when the home team also scored shortly after half-time, Chelsea could not respond. Hazard, who scored the winner in the Carabao Cup tie at Anfield earlier in the season, came closest to replying but his shot cannoned back off the post.\nIt is a loss that dents their hopes of reaching next season's Champions League via the top four - although they could still reach it via the Europa League. Chelsea hold a 1-0 lead over Slavia Prague going into the second leg of their quarter-final next Thursday.\nMan of the Match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\n'It's very overwhelming' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm so proud of the team, it was a fantastic performance. What a team, what a stadium, what an atmosphere. I'm so thankful I can be a part of this, it's great. It's just outstanding, very overwhelming at times.\n\"Well done, really well done, now let's prepare for Porto, Cardiff and whatever comes.\"\nOn the title race: \"The first question in the meeting today was 'what is the City score?' You cannot avoid knowing about it. But it isn't interesting to us.\n\"We expect them to win all their games so we just need to get as many points as possible and if we're champions then great but if not it is still a really good football team.\"\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri speaking to BBC Sport: \"I think we played very well in the first half, we defended very well. We conceded nothing.\n\"I am happy with the performance, because in my opinion we played a good match against a very good, strong opponent.\n\"I think now we are going the right way, we are improving, because three months ago we weren't able to stay in this kind of match but today we played well.\n\"And then we were unlucky after the second goal because we reacted very well and had three goal opportunities in three minutes.\"\nChelsea's poor run at the big six continues - the stats\nLiverpool registered only their third win over Chelsea in their past 17 meetings in all competitions (W3 D8 L6) and their first at Anfield since a 4-1 win in the Premier League in May 2012.\nChelsea have lost their past six away Premier League matches against fellow 'big six' opponents, conceding 16 goals across those defeats.\nThis was Liverpool's 26th Premier League victory of the season, equalling their record from the 2013-14 campaign under Brendan Rodgers. They last won more in a top-flight season in 1978-79 (30 wins).\nSadio Mane has scored 21 goals in all competitions this season - his best tally in a season for an English side.\nMohamed Salah's goal was his first from outside the box in the Premier League since scoring against Manchester City in January 2018.\nThis was Jurgen Klopp's 200th match in charge of Liverpool in all competitions (W112 D52 L36).\nAged 18 years and 158 days, Callum Hudson-Odoi became the youngest Chelsea player to start three consecutive Premier League games.\nSince the start of last season, Liverpool's Salah has scored more goals in all competitions than any other Premier League player (66).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool take a 2-0 lead to Portugal for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Porto on Wednesday before a trip to Cardiff in the Premier League on Sunday, 21 April.\nChelsea are also in European action against Slavia Prague in the Europa League quarter-final second leg at Stamford Bridge on Thursday, before hosting Burnley back in the league on Monday, 22 April."

        "article_text": "Watford 0-1 Arsenal: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pounces on Ben Foster howler\nA Ben Foster howler and a needless Troy Deeney red card helped Arsenal climb back into the Premier League top four with victory at Watford.\nGoalkeeper Foster gifted the Gunners an opening goal after 10 minutes when he took too long on the ball after collecting a back pass, allowing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to charge down his clearance and deflect the ball in.\nJust a minute later, Watford captain Deeney was sent off for throwing his forearm into the face of Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira in a late challenge.\nDespite playing with 10 men for 80 minutes, Watford offered the far greater threat, hitting the bar through Adam Masina's powerful drive from distance in the second half, and forcing Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno into a number of excellent saves.\nThe German denied Craig Cathcart well with his feet shortly after Deeney's red card - and later in the first half dived at full stretch to tip away Etienne Capoue's goalbound free-kick.\nAinsley Maitland-Niles also produced a crucial block with 10 minutes remaining when he slid in to block Andre Gray's shot after the Watford striker had rounded Leno.\nThe visitors' only real chance came midway through the second half but Foster brilliantly spread himself to block Henrikh Mkhitaryan's volley from close range.\nThe Gunners were well below their best but the rare away win could prove crucial in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League.\nThey climb two places to fourth in the table, two points clear of Manchester United and ahead of Chelsea on goal difference.\nReaction to Watford v Arsenal\nTwo moments of madness cost Watford\nOn the balance of play, Watford should have taken three points from this game; a win would have seen them jump from 10th to seventh in the Premier League.\nInstead they were left ruing two foolish incidents within 95 seconds of each other.\nThere seemed little danger when Foster collected a back pass just outside his six-yard box but he dawdled on the ball allowing the pacey Aubameyang enough time to close him down.\nDeeney's foul was not vicious or particularly dangerous, but foolish and unnecessary.\nHe chased down Torreira deep in the Arsenal half and after the Uruguayan had passed the ball threw his forearm into his opponent's face.\nDeeney said Arsenal lacked \"cojones\" after Watford won this fixture last season, adding that \"whenever I play against Arsenal, I'll go up and think, 'let me whack the first one and see who wants it'\". He may not have had those comments on his mind tonight but they will likely amuse Arsenal fans.\nFollowing the red card, Watford were far superior and in the final 20 minutes it was they who were pressing for an equaliser, rather than Arsenal looking likely to score a second goal.\nHad Watford, and in particular Gray, shown greater composure in the penalty box, then they may well have taken at least a point.\nThe Gunners too lacked composure when they did get into attacking positions, and for the most part their build-up play was too slow, but the win could prove crucial nonetheless.\nGunners cure travel trouble\nArsenal had only won two of their away games in 2019 before this match - at bottom-of-the-table Huddersfield and at League One Blackpool in the FA Cup.\nTheir home form - the third-best in the league - has kept them in the hunt for the top four, and a rare win on the road keeps them in control of their hopes.\nLeno's good saves, key clearances from captain Laurent Koscielny and Watford's wastefulness allowed them to keep their first clean sheet away from home this season. They had the only top-flight side without one on their travels.\nUnlike their top-four rivals, Arsenal do not play any of the Premier League's 'big six' before the end of the season - but must keep winning on the road if they are to seal Champions League qualification.\nThey have tricky away games to come against seventh-placed Leicester and eighth-placed Wolves as well as a trip to Burnley on the final day.\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue (Watford)\n'Never a red card' - manager reaction\nWatford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am very proud of my players. I am not interested in the result, we had our chances, hit the woodwork and created chances with 10 players.\n\"I respect the referee's decision. In my opinion it is clear, maybe a yellow card but never a red card. I do not agree with the decision.\n\"Troy is very sad. It was an important game for us, he knew it. The sending off was very tough for us.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were competitive today but in the circumstances we can control the match better. We didn't make it easy to score the second goal. We did not control the ball in the attacking third.\n\"A clean sheet is very important. It is going to give us a lot of information, this match. Our analysis will give us confidence.\n\"For some players like Konstantinos Mavropanos it is good, to play some minutes and give other players some rest for Thursday. It is a different competition; we have a two-goal advantage against Napoli but it is going to be very difficult.\"\nAubameyang is main man - the best stats\nWatford suffered their first defeat in six Premier League home games (W3 D2).\nArsenal kept their first away clean sheet in the Premier League this season at the 16th time of asking.\nNone of the past 12 Premier League meetings between Watford and Arsenal have ended in a draw (10 wins for Arsenal, two for Watford); only two fixtures in the competition have been played more often without ever sharing the spoils (Manchester United v Wigan (16), Aston Villa v Derby (14).\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2015-16, Watford have picked up 15 red cards in the competition, more than any other side.\nArsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in three goals in his three Premier League appearances against Watford, scoring two and assisting one.\nAubameyang netted his first goal away from Emirates Stadium since Boxing day (at Brighton), ending a run of seven games on the road in all competitions with scoring for Arsenal.\nSince his debut in February 2018, Aubameyang has been directly involved in 37 Premier League goals for Arsenal (28 goals, nine assists), 11 more than any other player for the Gunners in that time.\nWatford's Troy Deeney was sent off for the second time in the Premier League and for the first time since December 2017 against Huddersfield.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Napoli for their Europa League quarter-final second leg on Thursday (20:00 BST kick-off) as they look to defend a 2-0 lead.\nThe Gunners' next Premier League game is against Crystal Palace on Sunday (16:00 BST).\nWatford travel to Huddersfield in their next game on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

We had a lot of possession in their half but we are not scoring to get that breakthrough and we are putting ourselves under pressure,\" said the Brighton manager.\n\"We are on the back of two poor home defeats. We don't have a choice and we have a fight on our hands. This is a proper fight. We have to make sure we turn it round by staying together, digging deep and making ourselves hard to beat.\"\nBrighton may have a game in hand on Cardiff, but all five of their remaining fixtures will be difficult to earn any points at all from.\nMomentum shift to Cardiff?\nWarnock's full-time celebrations with his players and staff were as passionate and as heartfelt as might be expected from the experienced manager.\nAnd despite the fact that they are still in the bottom three, Cardiff's performance gives the sense of a change in direction at the foot of the Premier League.\n\"We're quite capable of picking points up off any of the teams we've got to play,\" said Warnock.\n\"You might think I'm in cuckoo land, but I think that we've got that ability on our day.\"\nThey resisted a strong start from Brighton before striking through to a superb long-range shot from Mendez-Laing, who ran from deep in his own half before receiving the ball back and curling it into the far corner of the net.\nMorrison rose virtually unchallenged at the far post to tighten Cardiff's grip with his first Premier League goal for the club.\nTaking points off title-chasing Liverpool next Sunday will be tough, but a visit to relegated Fulham on 27 April will be crucial if the momentum that looks to have swung Cardiff's way is to be maintained.\nMan of the match - Sean Morrison (Cardiff City)\n'Can you do it on a cold Tuesday?'- key stats\nCardiff's Nathaniel Mendez-Laing scored just his second Premier League goal of the season with the opener, each of his goals have come away from home on a Tuesday night\nThe Bluebirds have completed the league double over Brighton for the first time since the 1998-99 season - when the two clubs were in the fourth tier.\nCardiff have won a top-flight away match by more than a single goal for the first time since November 1956 (2-0 at Charlton Athletic).\nOnly relegated Fulham (six) and Huddersfield (four) have won fewer Premier League points in 2019 than Brighton (eight).\nBrighton have lost three consecutive home league games for the first time since January 2016 in the Championship - they failed to score a single goal in both these losing runs.\nCardiff's Sean Morrison has scored his third Premier League goal, his first for the Bluebirds and his first for 2,327 days since scoring for Reading against Manchester United in December 2012.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton visit Wolves on Saturday, 20 April (15:00 BST).

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-0 Tottenham: Phil Foden goal sends City top\nPhil Foden's first Premier League goal returned Manchester City to the top of the table as they overcame Champions League conquerors Tottenham at Etihad Stadium.\nThe 18-year-old's diving header, created by Sergio Aguero, after only five minutes ensured the reigning champions maintained the pressure on rivals Liverpool before their match at Cardiff City on Sunday.\nIt was, however, a nervous performance in a game a far cry from the drama of Wednesday's European game here as City relied on goalkeeper Ederson to make several crucial saves. They also lost key midfielder Kevin de Bruyne to injury.\nFoden gave City the perfect start but Ederson thwarted Son Heung-min on three occasions and saved well from Christian Eriksen and Lucas Moura. Son was also denied by a magnificent tackle by Aymeric Laporte.\nRaheem Sterling had City's best chance after the break, only to be frustrated by the outstretched leg of Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga - in for injured Hugo Lloris - but Pep Guardiola's side held on to move a point clear of Liverpool with four games left.\n'Chewed fingernails and unbearable tension - Man City show their steely side'\n'We are fighting with the best Liverpool ever'\nWho will win the title? Make your prediction\nGuardiola's men dig deep\nThe joy at the final whistle was a mixture of celebration and relief. This was a huge win for City and everyone inside the Etihad knew it.\nCity needed to pick themselves up instantly after the crushing disappointment of their Champions League exit in the knowledge that one slip, even if it came in the shape of a draw, could hand the title to Liverpool.\nThis was not the fluent City that is their trademark. The other qualities that can make champions came to the fore here - concentration, determination, heart, resilience and character.\nAnd it was in abundant supply throughout the team, from Ederson's outstanding saves, Laporte's priceless tackle on Son and in the outstanding performances of Foden and Bernardo Silva.\nFoden showed maturity beyond his years, even apart from his winner, demanding the ball, taking responsibility and directing more experienced players. It is early days but the evidence is clear that he is a special talent.\nSilva simply gets better, the ideal combination of limitless energy and creative skill, all employed within the Guardiola framework.\nThe only downside, a considerable one, was that injury to De Bruyne, which, judging from the player's reaction, may be a problem that threatens his participation in the rest of the season.\nThis City win will not earn maximum marks for artistic merit, but they did exactly what was needed after the traumatic Champions League exit as they recorded their 10th Premier League win in a row.\nSpurs felt City received a generous decision from referee Michael Oliver in the second half when they appealed for handball against Kyle Walker as he challenged with Dele Alli - but it is three points and on to the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\nSon now Tottenham's talisman\nSon Heung-min may not have punished City as he did on Wednesday, but his performance confirmed he will be Tottenham's torch bearer in the absence of the injured Harry Kane.\nWhen Kane is missing, weight inevitably shifts on to the shoulders of the South Korean, but it is an added burden he carries lightly.\nSon was the man who had the Etihad's nerves on edge whenever he had the ball or was in the general vicinity of it.\nHe brought important saves from Ederson and played with the pace and power that now makes him out as one of the Premier League's finest forwards.\nSpurs could not quite replicate their heroics of Wednesday when, even though they lost 4-3 on the night, they made it through to the Champions League semi-finals on aggregate.\nIt is a result that inflicts some damage because, even though they remain in third place, the defeat offers up more hope to Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United in the increasingly competitive battle for the top four.\nMan of the match - Ederson (Man City)\n'I couldn't have done what my players did' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"Both teams have incredible players with heart and personality. It was a real tough game after our mental defeat on Wednesday and we knew we could have lost the Premier League today.\n\"As a footballer, I could not have done what my players have done today. The title is still in our hands.\n\"We've been on a remarkable run, playing against an incredible team like Tottenham and fighting for the Premier League with the best Liverpool team ever, one of the best teams I've seen in my life.\n\"We'll fight until the end and see how far we get.\"\nOn goalscorer Phil Foden: \"He's so dynamic and adds extra intensity into our game. I wanted more attack and aggression in the box and he brings that to us with his work and ability. He did well today against top players.\"\nFoden: \"When an opportunity comes along, I want to be able to take it. Today it paid off. Kun (Aguero) did great to head it back across goal and luckily I was there.\n\"I want to get in the box and score goals. I look up to every player in this team and try and learn from them.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was an amazing game. Both teams competed really well and we deserved more. Ederson was man of the match.\n\"I am happy; disappointed with the result but so happy with the performance. Our next three games will be decisive in achieving all we want this season.\"\nFive successive away defeats for Spurs - the stats\nManchester City have won 25 home games in all competitions this season, the most in a single campaign and the most by an English top-flight club since Manchester United won 26 in 2010-11.\nTottenham have lost five successive league away games for the first time since May 2004, a run of six under manager David Pleat.\nCity have won their past 10 league games - their longest streak since a run of 18 between August and December 2017, which remains the top-flight record.\nTottenham have lost 11 league games this season, as many as they had in their previous two campaigns combined (4 in 2016-17, 7 in 2017-18).\nPhil Foden became the third youngest City player to score in the Premier League after Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge.\nSergio Aguero has now failed to score in his past seven Premier League appearances against Spurs, having netted 10 goals in his first seven against them.\nBernardo Silva was directly involved in seven of Manchester City's 15 shots in the match, having three attempts and creating four.\nTottenham have lost a league game without Harry Kane taking part for the first time since October 2017 at Manchester United.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Brighton at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday (19:45 BST), while City make the short trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United on Wednesday (20:00)."

We need to get to grips with it. I think it's mentality, I think we go into games thinking it's too easy.\n\"That's our season summed up: good one week and then a shambles the next. It's really disappointing because we thought we started well and then we just crumbled.\"\nThe Cherries, unbeaten until now in their 10 home matches against promoted opposition, began brightly but fell away after missing several early chances.\nHowe's side were also hampered by injuries to right-back Adam Smith in the warm-up and his replacement Junior Stanislas midway through the first period, contributing to a disjointed showing.\nSerbia international Mitrovic profited by drawing a foul from substitute Jack Simpson and sending home goalkeeper Artur Boruc the wrong way from the resulting penalty.\nThe result leaves Bournemouth in 12th while Fulham remain second bottom of the Premier League.\nFollow all the reaction from the Premier League\nMitrovic and Rico set the tone\nHaving gathered just two points on their travels all season, the odds were stacked against Fulham when they arrived on the south coast.\nWith their relegation to the Championship confirmed a fortnight ago, it was hard to see how the division's second leakiest defence could contain a Bournemouth side that looked so irresistible when scoring five at Brighton last Saturday.\nHowever, after taking time to grow into the game and capitalising on the Cherries' early wastefulness, caretaker manager Scott Parker saw his side earn a victory they more than merited.\n\"I asked the team if they could back up the performance [against Everton] and the challenge was: can we get the first away win and win two on the bounce?\" Parker said.\n\"It was a fine performance last week and today was the same.\"\nSpanish goalkeeper Sergio Rico made several excellent saves, twice denying Callum Wilson in the second period to preserve Fulham's advantage.\nAt the other end of the pitch, Mitrovic caused problems all afternoon. The 24-year-old lashed a left-foot volley over in the first half when well placed, but made no mistake from 12 yards after drawing a foul from Simpson.\nHis nuisance value was underlined by his five shots on goal, which was only bettered by Bournemouth winger Fraser.\nDisjointed Bournemouth fail to spark\nThe numbers were all stacked in Bournemouth's favour prior to and during the first half of this fixture, but the game went dramatically off script once Mitrovic had stroked home from the penalty spot.\nThe Cherries had enjoyed close to 70% of the possession in the first 20 minutes but Wilson's ballooned effort inside the first minute ended up setting the tone for an unproductive afternoon.\nThat was the first of a number of gilt-edged chances that came and went for Howe's team.\nJoshua King blazed over from 10 yards after excellent work by Fraser on the left, and the Scotland winger also twice tested Rico without success.\nBournemouth's reorganisation in defence, with both captain Steve Cook and Chris Mepham utilised at right-back, and fellow central defender Nathan Ake at left-back, also proved a hindrance as Fulham carved out nine chances in the second period.\nIt leaves Bournemouth one victory short of what could be a club record of 13 in a Premier League season and five points adrift of their best ever points tally (46 in 2016-17).\n\"We created enough chances to win the game but we obviously didn't take those. We were rocked with a couple of injuries and that's never easy to take,\" Howe said.\n\"The effort was there but the quality wasn't there. From last week it was the polar opposite, the decision making wasn't quite where it was.\"\nMan of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham)\n'The Vitality penalty hot-spot' - the stats\nFulham picked up their first league win over Bournemouth since January 1994, when both sides were in the third tier of English football.\nBournemouth suffered their 18th defeat of the Premier League season, equalling their most in a single campaign in the competition (18 in 2015-16).\nFulham have won back-to-back games in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014, when they beat Aston Villa and Norwich under Felix Magath.\nBournemouth have lost four of their seven Premier League home games against teams starting the day in the relegation zone, with this their first such defeat since losing against Crystal Palace in January 2017.\nBournemouth haven't won any of their last five home games in the Premier League - their longest such run since February 2017 (D2 L3).\nNo stadium has seen more penalties awarded this season than the Vitality Stadium (10 - seven for Bournemouth, three for the opposition).\nAleksandar Mitrovic's goal for Fulham ended a run of nine Premier League games without scoring - he hadn't netted with any of his previous 36 shots in the competition prior to his penalty.\nAleksandar Mitrovic's penalty was the first he has scored in the Premier League since April 2016 (for Newcastle v Norwich) - he had failed to score each of his last two penalties before today.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Southampton for their next Premier League fixture on Saturday, 27 April (15:00 BST). Fulham host Cardiff on the same date (also 15:00 BST)."

I will stay positive because we have to learn from this season.\n\"In the 4-3-3 we started today, we were on the front foot against a team that are doing really well this season and we caused them problems and that's what we should take out of this game.\n\"We conceded too early and we know it's even harder to go. When you create so many chances against Watford who have a stable defence, it makes me proud.\n\"It's about taking chances which they did twice and it's hard to take.\"\nWatford boss, Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"First of all I would like to speak about Huddersfield. Credit to them, it is not easy to play in this situation after their relegation.\n\"They tried. They made it very difficult today and it was a close game. We conceded in the last minute and in my opinion we had control of the game but we needed to kill it before the end and we didn't.\n\"I think Gerard [Deulofeu] is showing his quality. He's scoring more goals for us but always showed what he is able to do.\n\"It's important for the team for our players to score goals for us.\"\nAnother home struggle for the Terriers - the stats\nHuddersfield Town have lost 14 home Premier League games this season, a joint record in the competition's history (also 14 for Sunderland in 2002-03 and 2005-06).\nWatford have won six away Premier League games this season, only winning more in a top-flight season in 1983-84 under Graham Taylor (seven).\nHuddersfield have lost 21 of their last 23 matches in all competitions (W1 D1 L21), losing 11 of their 12 games under manager Jan Siewert (W1 D0 L11).\nGerard Deulofeu has scored six goals in his last five Premier League away games for Watford.\nHuddersfield have won none of the 45 Premier League matches in which they've conceded the first goal (W0 D3 L42), losing all 19 at the John Smith's Stadium when conceding first.\nIn all competitions, Gerard Deulofeu has scored eight goals and assisted two more in his last nine appearances for Watford.\nHuddersfield midfielder Juninho Bacuna has started 15 matches for the Terriers in all competitions this season and ended on the losing side in all 15.\nSince his Premier League debut for Huddersfield Town on 2 February, Karlan Grant has scored four league goals - no other Terriers player has scored more than once in that time.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield could play a pivotal role in the title race as they travel to Anfield under the lights on Friday, 26 April (20:00 BST), while Watford host Southampton in midweek on Tuesday, 23 April (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 0-0 Brighton: Struggling Seagulls earn valuable point\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton said there was \"probably a bit of relief\" among Seagulls fans after his side ended a run of five successive defeats to earn a valuable point at Wolves in their battle against relegation.\nKeeper Mat Ryan was the hero for the visitors, who move three points clear of the Premier League bottom three.\nFirst, Ryan bravely got down as Leander Dendoncker closed in on the rebound when Wolves dangerman Diogo Jota headed against a post midway through the second-half. Then, three minutes from time, Ryan was in the right place to stop the Belgian's header.\n\"I'm not sure many people would have backed us to get any type of result, but we have,\" said Hughton.\n\"We asked the players for a response. It's very hard to come here - if you open up too much, they can hurt you.\n\"We could have been better in our link-up play, but we knew if we could keep a clean sheet it would give us a chance.\"\nIn a meeting of the two beaten FA Cup semi-finalists, Brighton offered little as an attacking force and it is now 570 minutes since they last scored.\nHowever, given their 12-goal advantage over third-bottom Cardiff, Saturday's point means even a shock win for the Bluebirds against title contenders Liverpool on Sunday will not be enough to send Hughton's men into the bottom three.\n\"The feeling in the changing room has been good,\" added the 60-year-old. \"You don't become a bad team overnight.\n\"We conceded a lot of corners today. They've got some aggressive players, so we had to defend really well.\"\nWolves will surely feel it is two dropped points in their quest to be the 'best of the rest' by finishing seventh. They drop to ninth.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nChampions League and Europa League: Who will qualify?\nSeagulls dig deep at Molineux\nWhen Brighton beat Crystal Palace on 4 December to move into the top half of the Premier League, they were 12 points clear of the relegation zone.\nIn the 19 games since, they have won only three times and collected 13 points. If that form was replicated over a full season, they would have eight points fewer than West Brom's 34 in 2005, the lowest number from any team not to go down.\nAgainst that backdrop, it was perhaps no surprise Brighton adopted a policy of containment, which was not helped by the ninth-minute loss of Dutch midfielder Davy Propper to a hamstring injury. In the opening half hour, they had 20% possession and no shots - indeed, the Seagulls have only scored one first-half goal in the Premier League since the start of February.\nSubstitute Beram Kayal did at least try to end the barren scoring run after the break with a 30-yard shot that had Wolves keeper Rui Patricio scrambling as it flew over.\nThat was about it for Brighton as an attacking force, although they will take some solace in their first clean sheet away from home in the league since October. Central defenders Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk were outstanding in repelling in-form Raul Jimenez, even though Australia keeper Ryan took the plaudits at the end.\nDespite Brighton's perilous position and their woeful form, Hughton retains the faith of supporters, who cheered their team off at the end, and the club's hierarchy.\nHowever, with trips to Tottenham and Arsenal to come before a final-day home encounter with Manchester City, next Saturday's meeting with Newcastle at the Amex looks hugely important.\nFrustration for dominant Wolves\nThe inference is Nuno Espirito Santo's men find it hard to break down opponents who are not so bothered about attacking themselves.\nWolves played up to that stereotype during a first half they dominated throughout without managing a shot on target.\nJota came closest to breaking the deadlock, firing wide from 16 yards after surging into the box, then clipping the top of the bar as he slid in to meet a deflected Ruben Neves shot.\nThe Portuguese hit the woodwork again after the break, with his header against a post causing the major scramble that turned into the nearest either side came to a goal.\nJimenez fired over from the edge of the area and Ryan easily dealt with Neves' shot from a similar position.\nHowever, while Wolves never looked likely to surrender an unbeaten home record that stretches back to 2 January, their Achilles heel of struggling against teams they should beat may end up costing them a Europa League place, which will be the reward for finishing seventh should Manchester City beat Watford in the FA Cup final.\nMan of the match - Mat Ryan (Brighton)\nRare away clean sheet for Brighton - the stats\nBrighton have lost just one of their past 10 league games against Wolves, winning four.\nSix of the past eight league games between Wolves and Brighton at Molineux have ended in a draw.\nBrighton have failed to score in their past five Premier League games, their worst run in the league since January 2016.\nBrighton kept just their second clean sheet on the road in the league this season, with their other shutout coming against Newcastle in October.\nNo side have failed to have a shot on target in more Premier League games this season than Brighton (three - versus Liverpool, Watford and Wolves).\nWolves have had 47 shots against Brighton this season without scoring, the most shots against a single opponent without finding the net since Tottenham against West Ham in 2010-11 (51).\n'We knew it would be difficult' - what the managers said\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was difficult. We had chances, we had a lot of the ball. This is football. It didn't happen today.\n\"Brighton defended well. Their main objective was not to concede. Sometimes the one that hits the post will go in. We recovered the ball very high up the pitch, which requires effort. It is not easy. The boys tried everything.\n\"Brighton put all the bodies in front of the goal. We knew how difficult it was going to be, but we should do better.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"We got a reaction and want to take value from the manner of the result. They have a lot of gifted players. We had to show work ethic and determination. If we had shown anything less we would not have got the result. Hopefully we can take that through until the end of the season.\n\"We are lacking a little bit of confidence in front of goal. If we can show that kind of determination we have a chance. We are on the back of two very disappointing results. We showed we are not such a bad team.\n\"We have been able to stay in the game against the big teams. We have not had a big defeat. Our worst defeat was Bournemouth.\"\nWhat's next?\nBrighton are next in action at Tottenham on Tuesday (19:45 BST kick-off). Wolves entertain Arsenal the following day (19:45)."

        "article_text": "West Ham 2-2 Leicester: Harvey Barnes secures controversial late draw\nLeicester substitute Harvey Barnes scored in stoppage time to secure a controversial Premier League draw with West Ham in a frantic finish at London Stadium.\nThe Hammers looked on course for victory after Lucas Perez turned in the rebound when fellow replacement Pedro Obiang hit the post after 82 minutes.\nThe Spaniard should have had a second goal when he rounded Kasper Schmeichel after Obiang's through ball but was wrongly called offside.\nThat allowed the visitors to sweep forward in search of another equaliser and Youri Tielemans picked out Barnes, who slotted low beyond Lukasz Fabianski for his first Leicester goal.\nWinger Michail Antonio put West Ham ahead for the first time before the break, rising above Ben Chilwell to head in Mark Noble's fine cross from the left.\nJamie Vardy levelled for the Foxes with his ninth goal in 10 league games thanks to an exquisite finish at the near post.\nLeicester fall one place to eighth in the table, while West Ham remain 11th.\nChampions League and Europa League: Who will qualify in various scenarios?\nLeicester leave it late\nLeicester were mostly lacklustre for the first hour, occasionally looking bright on the counter but lacking a clinical edge, with James Maddison's low drive that was easily saved their only chance of note.\nEnter Vardy. The former England striker showed sharp instincts to get across Fabian Balbuena in a flash and divert Chilwell's low cross beyond Fabianski.\nManager Brendan Rodgers told The Premier League Show this week that he wants to establish Leicester as a top-six side.\nIt will be intriguing to see how long 32-year-old Vardy remains part of that project as he gives his team a vital intensity and dependable goal threat they otherwise can lack at times.\nThere is plenty of young talent, though. Maddison was lively throughout, Barnes showed tremendous composure to slide in his late equaliser, set up by the creative Tielemans, whom Leicester must want to sign permanently once his loan deal from Monaco ends.\nTo become a perennial top-six side, Leicester will have to be more convincing against West Ham and other ambitious mid-table teams, but there are promising signs to build on.\nHammers end losing run\nAfter a run of three straight defeats, albeit including an unlucky loss to Manchester United last week, this was an encouraging performance by West Ham.\nThey were much the better side before the break, shifting the ball between the flanks to try and drag Leicester out of position, which paid off for the opener.\nBy applying pressure down the left, the hosts engineered a mismatch for Antonio on the much smaller Chilwell at the back post before Noble exchanged passes with Robert Snodgrass and picked out Antonio to firmly head in.\nAntonio should have scored moments earlier when failing to turn in Marko Arnautovic's volleyed cross from two yards, and West Ham may feel they should have put a subdued Leicester away in the first half.\nYet they continued to create and were ultimately denied by a mistake. Arnautovic and Snodgrass were withdrawn for Perez and Obiang, who combined to twice put the ball in the net, with only one counting.\nLeicester appealed for offside for the first but Perez timed his run exactly to side-foot home after Obiang's low, curling strike came back off the right-hand post.\nIn the game's most controversial moment late on, Obiang nipped the ball off Tielemans and played in Perez, who did not see the flag as he rounded Schmeichel, with replays showing he was just behind the foot of the last Leicester defender.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio (West Ham)\n'More fair' with VAR - reaction\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We deserved more than a draw. We scored a legal goal for 3-1 and with that the game would have been finished, but it was a mistake of the linesman.\n\"I've seen it again and he was one metre onside. There is nothing you can do about that. Next season when we have VAR it can be more fair.\n\"We generally played well but you cannot concede two goals.\"\nLeicester City boss Brendan Rodgers on Lucas Perez's disallowed late goal: \"It looks like we got away with one.\n\"I'm delighted for Harvey Barnes, getting the goal will be a weight off his shoulders. It was a wonderful run and a really calm finish.\n\"Jamie Vardy is a top-class striker and it was a great touch, a really good finish.\"\nUse your head, Antonio - stats\nOnly Liverpool (16) and West Ham (15) have gained more points from losing positions in the Premier League than Leicester this season (14).\nLeicester have both scored and conceded in 13 away league games this season, more than any other side.\nWest Ham's Michail Antonio scored his 25th Premier League goal, with 15 of them coming via his head. Of players with at least 25 goals in the competition, only John Terry (66%) has scored a higher percentage of headers than Antonio (60%).\nJamie Vardy has scored nine goals in his past 10 league games for Leicester, including seven in his seven appearances under manager Brendan Rodgers.\nHarvey Barnes' goal was the 5,000th scored in the top four tiers of English league football this season.\nAll four of Lucas Perez's Premier League goals (1 for Arsenal, 3 for West Ham) have come as a substitute.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Tottenham in the Premier League on 27 April at 12:30 BST, while Leicester host Arsenal at 12:00 on 28 April."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 3-1 Southampton: Ayoze Perez hat-trick gives Newcastle victory\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez said he \"wants to compete\" after watching his team beat Southampton in the Premier League at St James's Park.\nAyoze Perez scored a hat-trick as they saw off a spirited second-half performance from the Saints.\nBenitez, who is out of contract in the summer, said nothing had changed in regard to his job situation and suggested he still needs assurances before deciding his future.\n\"We are in the same position as we were before,\" he said. \"When I came here, I could see the potential of the club to be challenging, certainly for seventh to 10th in the table but looking higher.\n\"But when you analyse the transfer fees and wage bills of other teams, we're not competing.\n\"I am the manager until 30 June. We can see the potential. When you see the teams between seventh and 15th, we have to compete with them.\"\nBenitez suggested earlier in the week that he wanted to manage in the Champions League again.\nThis win propelled Newcastle into 12th place in the Premier League table, 10 points above the relegation zone and almost certainly safe for another season.\n\"Mathematically, we will have to wait and see what happens,\" Benitez said. \"But I think we will be safe.\"\nFor Southampton, an improved second-half performance yielded only substitute Mario Lemina's goal and they sit just five points above Cardiff in 18th with four games to play.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nClinical Perez on fire for Newcastle\nPerez had scored four in his last seven homes games as well as the winner at Leicester last weekend and he continued his fine run of form with a superbly taken hat-trick.\nHis first was a perfectly placed clipped shot, kissing the inside of the far post after Isaac Hayden had won the ball back in midfield.\nHe followed that up two minutes later as his determination to meet Salomon Rondon's low cross ahead of Ryan Bertrand bought him and his team a second goal.\nAfter Newcastle had toiled in the second half, he completed his hat-trick with just four minutes left, poaching a close range header after Matt Ritchie had bravely dived in to win a rushed Southampton clearance.\nPerez has now got 10 Premier League goals this season, the first Newcastle player to do so since Georginio Wijnaldum in 2015-16.\nPerez's burgeoning confidence crowned a strong performance from Newcastle who, after a 10th place finish last season, are chasing down the top half of the table once again.\nBenitez has done a remarkable job on limited resources but, with Premier League survival almost certainly secured, it is surely imperative that they keep hold of him and back him significantly if this club is going to return to where it feel it belongs, challenging at the higher end of the table.\nSaints fail to take their chances\nSouthampton had won four of their previous six games in the Premier League but it took time for them to warm up in the Easter sunshine at St James' Park.\nIn a disappointing first-half performance, they were barely involved as Newcastle's full-pitch pressing game squeezed the life out of Ralph Hasenhuttl's side.\nIndeed, it could have been worse for the Saints, had referee Anthony Taylor not showed leniency when last-man James Ward-Prowse cynically took out Miguel Almiron.\nTactical changes at half-time however gave them a boost and substitute Mario Lemina took his opening superbly, slotting home after fellow sub Stuart Armstrong's lay-off.\nMaya Yoshida ought to have levelled matters but he somehow volleyed over with the goal at his mercy midway through the second half. The Japanese defender should also have scored in injury time but his header was brilliantly turned aside by Martin Dubravka.\nDespite the improvement, it's a reality check for Hasenhuttl's team who are not mathematically safe and may require points from their remaining games to ensure Premier League survival.\nMan of the match: Ayoze Perez (Newcastle)\n'We're still far away' - what they said:\nNewcastle boss Rafa Benitez: \"The main thing was to win. I'm really proud of this group of players for working so hard.\n\"Ayoze has to be consistent but he is capable of doing this kind of thing [scoring hat-tricks] and has the quality.\"\nOn his own future: \"Today, we will enjoy it. In an ideal world I want to compete for something. That's the main thing. If you analyse the transfer fee and wage bill, it's far away.\n\"We'll keep preparing the team and see.\"\nNewcastle's hat-trick hero Ayoze Perez: \"It's an unbelievable feeling to get three goals and get three important points. I need to thank my team-mates for the way we are playing and I am very proud of myself for the hat-trick.\n\"It's been a couple of months that are very important for us. We've done very well, We've got great results and now that we're safe we're going to start looking forward and up and finish even better.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"The first half was too bad so we didn't deserve to get anything. If you start like that and are 2-0 down at half-time, it's hard to come back.\n\"Changing shape caused more problems for Newcastle. They didn't have a lot of chances in the second half, apart from hitting the post, which was lucky.\n\"We have to be sharper and more aggressive. We know we are not safe - 40 points is the reason why it's a crucial game on Tuesday. We need to be concentrated and hard working.\"\nSaints join City and Spurs in goal record - the stats\nThis was Newcastle's sixth home Premier League win of 2019 - only Man City (8) and Arsenal (7) have won more.\nSouthampton have lost three of their last four away Premier League games (W1 D0 L3), having lost just one of their first four away matches under Ralph Hasenhuttl (W2 D2 L1).\nAyoze Perez's hat-trick was Newcastle's first in the Premier League since October 2015, when Georginio Wijnaldum scored four times against Norwich City.\nAyoze Perez has scored 10 Premier League goals this season - his best tally in a single top-flight season for Newcastle United.\nNewcastle's Ayoze Perez has scored seven goals in his last seven Premier League appearances at St James' Park.\nSalomon Rondon has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Newcastle player this season (15: 9 goals, 6 assists).\nSouthampton goalkeeper Angus Gunn conceded a Premier League hat-trick 25 years and 11 days after his father Bryan Gunn conceded one in the Premier League against Southampton in April 1994, with Matt Le Tissier scoring a treble for the Saints that day.\nSouthampton have scored 12 Premier League goals from outside the box this season, a joint high along with Man City and Spurs.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton face Watford on Tuesday, 23 April at Vicarage Road (19:45 BST) while Newcastle travel to Brighton on Saturday, 27 April (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Everton 4-0 Manchester United: Toffees cruise to victory\nEverton produced a thrilling display to outclass a woeful Manchester United at Goodison Park and expose all the problems facing Red Devils manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\nUnited face a fight to secure a Premier League top-four place and Champions League football next season after 90 minutes which were little other than torture against a rampant Everton.\nUnited goalkeeper David de Gea had saved superbly from Richarlison before the Brazilian hooked in an acrobatic 13th-minute volley to set the tone for a magnificent display from Marco Silva's side.\nDe Gea was beaten by Gylfi Sigurdsson's low 25-yard drive, going down late, as Everton took total control.\nEverton did not let up after the break, Lucas Digne scoring from long range after De Gea punched out a corner, before substitute Theo Walcott ran clear on to Sigurdsson's pass to slide home the fourth.\nUnited have lost six of their past eight games in all competitions, while a fifth successive away defeat - for the first time since 1981 - leaves them facing the prospect of Europa League football next season.\n'That was not worthy of a Man Utd team' - Solskjaer apologises to fans\nEverton in devastating form\nEverton are on a hot streak at Goodison Park but this can rank alongside the finest displays seen at the famous old stadium in many seasons.\nYes, much will be made of United's obvious deficiencies, but it would be a gross injustice to ignore a magnificent performance from a side who have drawn with Liverpool and beaten Chelsea, Arsenal and United in their past four home games without conceding a goal.\nEverton swarmed all over United from the first whistle and there was never a moment when they looked like relinquishing control.\nSilva's pressing approach saw United harassed mercilessly for 90 minutes, but this was not simply about work-rate - Everton were full of skill, pace and athleticism.\nIdrissa Gueye was the fulcrum in midfield while Sigurdsson and the gifted Brazilian Bernard were the creators-in-chief from first to last.\nThere may have been some doubts expressed about Silva's position not so long ago, but this blistering run of home form - and a style which will win full favour from Everton's fans - surely means he will be given time to build, as he should.\nMan Utd a heartless, abject shambles\nUnited were reduced to being ironically cheered by their own supporters for merely stringing three passes together with Everton 4-0 up and in cruise control.\nAnd, yes, it was that bad.\nSolskjaer's side were quite simply over-run and did not even show the heart or fighting spirit to escape from a joyous Goodison with any dignity on a desperate day.\nThere was simply nothing good about this United performance. Indeed, given Everton's superiority, they were fortunate the scoreline did not have an even more embarrassing appearance.\nPaul Pogba strolled around midfield while Gueye, Morgan Schneiderlin and Sigurdsson snapped into challenges, and it was a nightmare return to Everton for striker Romelu Lukaku.\nTaunted throughout, he could not do a thing right and his afternoon simply went from bad to worse.\nHe was not alone. De Gea may have saved well from Richarlison early on but he was slow to react to Sigurdsson's shot and it was his punch that fell at Digne's feet to score. The Spain keeper is having a mixed season.\nIt was five years ago to the day since a 2-0 loss here ended David Moyes' reign - and this United performance was even worse than that.\nSolksjaer has inherited a mess, the early gloss from his arrival has worn off and players like Pogba and Lukaku, who were revived after Jose Mourinho was sacked, look back to their bad old ways.\nNow there is the small matter of the derby against title-chasing Manchester City at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\nMan of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson (Everton)\n'I want to apologise' - what they said\nEverton boss Marco Silva, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I'm delighted with the players. It's important to remind you what we did in the last four home games - we're on a fantastic run.\n\"Our last performance away was not good enough and we must show something different. We did. We were the best team on the pitch from the first to last minute.\n\"When we won against Chelsea we were 26 games without a win against the top six. After we won I said we will change that, and now we are playing with quality at home.\n\"It's important to see our fans enjoying what we are doing - everything what I want as a manager. We are doing really well. Last seven games, five clean sheets.\"\nMan Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were beaten on all aspects today. The only place we beat Everton - I can't say we beat them - but we had a fantastic support and I just want to apologise for the performance we turned out.\n\"We have been fantastic for long periods and it's a tough league to get into the top four, never mind winning the league. There are six teams there and Everton want to be in there.\n\"We know it's a big task and work to be done. We have to do it together; we have to get on with it because this is not good enough.\n\"You have got to start somewhere and we will give it everything we have got with the last four games - massive games with City and Chelsea coming to Old Trafford. That's where we get the best support in the world.\n\"We can turn it around. In football, like in life, things can change quickly. We have got to change it from bad to good.\n\"We need a game of football as soon as we can as we need to get this out of the systems.\n\"Everyone here can say with hands on hearts that's not good enough - not worthy of a Manchester United team. We know that and apologise again to fans.\"\nMan Utd continue to struggle on the road - the stats\nThis was Everton's biggest margin of victory over Manchester United in any competition since beating them 5-0 in October 1984.\nIt was United biggest defeat to any opposition since a 4-0 loss to Chelsea in October 2016.\nThis was United's fifth consecutive away defeat in all competitions, their longest such run of losses since March 1981 under Dave Sexton (also five).\nUnited have conceded 48 Premier League goals in 2018-19, their highest tally in a single season in the competition and their most in a league campaign since 1978-79 (63).\nEverton have won more points at home to the 'big six' clubs this season (10 - P6 W3 D1 L2) than any other team outside the top six.\nUnited have gone 11 consecutive matches without a clean sheet in all competitions for the first time since 1998.\nEverton have now won four of their past seven home league games against United (D1 L2); they had won only three of their first 20 Premier League games against them at Goodison Park before this (D3 L14).\nOnly Andrei Kanchelskis (15 in 1995-96), Yakubu (15 in 2007-08) and Romelu Lukaku (15 in 2013-14) scored more Premier League goals in their debut season with Everton than Richarlison this term (13).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been directly involved in nine Premier League goals against Manchester United (five goals, four assists), more than he has against any other club.\nUnited goalkeeper David de Gea has conceded eight goals from outside the box in the league this season, the only campaign in which he has conceded more was 2013-14 (9).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United host Manchester City in the derby on Wednesday at 20:00 BST, and Everton visit Crystal Palace on Saturday at 15:00."

Warnock's charges tenaciously stuck to their task in the face of constant pressure.\nCardiff were not without an attacking threat themselves, with winger Nathaniel Mendez-Laing demonstrating his speed and trickery to beat Alexander-Arnold three times inside the opening half-an-hour.\nThe Bluebirds were close to taking the lead shortly before the break, with Oumar Niasse - on loan from Everton - athletically hooking towards goal with a volley that was well saved by Alisson.\nThat gave the home crowd some hope and, even after Liverpool went ahead, Cardiff had their moments.\nOnly Morrison will know how he managed to miss with a near-open goal at the back post, the centre-back mistiming his dive and seemingly hitting the ball with his back.\nHis next major involvement was to prove the end of Cardiff's hopes of snatching a point from this game, as he grappled with Salah and conceded the penalty that Milner converted to leave Cardiff three points behind 17th-placed Brighton, with three games to play - one fewer than the Seagulls.\nMan of the Match - Joel Matip (Liverpool)\nRecord points haul for Liverpool - the stats\nLiverpool have now amassed 88 points in the league this season, their best total in a Premier League season; adjusting to three points for a win, they have only earned more in a top-flight campaign in 1978-79 (98) and 1987-88 (90).\nThis was Cardiff City's 10th home league defeat of the season, their most in a single season since 1994-95 in the third tier, when they lost 12 and were relegated.\nThe top six teams have won all 33 of their Premier League matches versus the current bottom three teams in the table this season. This is a top-flight record; surpassing 30 wins in such games in 1891-92, 1978-79, 1985-86, 2001-02, 2011-12 and 2013-14.\nLiverpool have now won nine consecutive matches in all competitions, their longest winning streak since April 2014 under Brendan Rodgers (also nine games) - a run which also included a victory away at Cardiff.\nCardiff have now lost each of their four Premier League matches against Liverpool, conceding 15 goals in all, more than they have against any other opponent in the competition.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum's goal for Liverpool was just his second to be scored away from home in the Premier League, with the other 19 all coming in home games.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's assist for Liverpool was his 10th of the season in all competitions, seven of which have come in his past 11 matches.\nLiverpool have scored more goals via corners (13) than any other side in the Premier League this season, while Cardiff have conceded the most from such scenarios (12).\nTen of James Milner's last 12 league goals for Liverpool have come from the penalty spot, with nine of those 12 goals also coming away from home.\nOnly Wilfried Zaha (six) has won more Premier League penalties this season than Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah (five).\n'We knew we had to stay patient' - what the managers said\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock, speaking to Match of the Day: \"As a manager, you cannot ask anything more than what my lads are giving. To hang in as we did for that time, I'm really proud of them.\n\"We might need two wins and a draw. It's difficult to see where we're going to get a break. I still can't get over [the defeat against] Chelsea. If you saw the dressing room afterwards, I have never seen people destroyed like that.\n\"The fans have been amazing all season and that helps the manager. They know I am doing my best. We're all trying to punch above our weight.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was prepared to be a proper banana skin and we knew that. The boys were unbelievable. It was clear it was going to be difficult for all of us.\n\"The weather changed and made it much more intense. We knew we had to stay patient and do the right things. It was very dry on the pitch, so passing was not very easy.\n\"The boys didn't get frustrated. We had wonderful chances in the first half but we knew if we continued, we would have chances. It was brilliant how we scored the goals.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool welcome Huddersfield to Anfield on Friday (20:00 BST), while Cardiff travel to Fulham the day after (15:00)."

a win would have lifted them into third, two points ahead of Spurs.\nAll the goals were scored in the opening 24 minutes with Jeff Hendrick giving Burnley an eighth-minute lead before N'Golo Kante equalised after wonderful skill by Eden Hazard.\nGonzalo Higuain put Chelsea in front six minutes and 14 seconds after Burnley's opener.\nHowever, the visitors were level when Ashley Barnes scored from close range, his 11th league goal of the season.\nOn a frustrating night for Maurizio Sarri's side, Callum Hudson-Odoi ruptured his Achilles tendon and Kante went off with a rib injury, while the Chelsea boss was sent to the stands towards the end.\nBurnley are now almost certainly safe from relegation with three games to go, holding a nine-point advantage over 18th-placed Cardiff and with a goal difference 17 better than the Welsh side.\nChelsea's Luiz accuses Burnley of 'anti-football'\nReaction from Stamford Bridge\nChelsea frustrations boil over after missed opportunity\nChelsea started the weekend in fifth place but, despite failing to win for the second successive league game, end it in fourth, with Arsenal dropping out of the Champions League spots.\nHowever, this was a missed opportunity for the Blues, who have played one more game than the teams around them.\nFrustrations boiled over towards the end with David Luiz and Barnes involved in an altercation on the pitch, Sarri ordered away from the dugout and a scuffle taking place near the tunnel entrance at the final whistle.\nChelsea were unhappy with what they perceived to be time-wasting tactics by the visitors yet that failed to disguise the hosts' poor defending, Burnley scoring from their only two shots on target in the first half.\nMidfielder Hendrick was left unmarked when he produced a delightful curling finish to put Burnley ahead with his third league goal of the season.\nIn a remarkable passage of play, Chelsea quickly levelled when Hazard got the better of Matthew Lowton before pulling it back for Kante to smash home from 12 yards out.\nChelsea were ahead through Higuain's beautiful first-time finish after Cesar Azpilicueta's backheel into his path.\nBurnley were back level when Chelsea failed to deal with a free-kick, Barnes pouncing inside the six-yard area after a flick by Chris Wood.\nChelsea have now conceded seven times in the past three games, a big concern for Sarri as his side also look to seal a Europa League final spot.\nBurnley show spirit to all but secure safety\nAfter losing 5-1 at home to Everton on 26 December, Burnley were third bottom in the table, three points from safety following a sixth defeat in seven games.\nFast forward 16 games and eight wins, the Clarets are as good as safe with three matches to spare after a spirited performance against Chelsea left Cardiff requiring an extraordinary set of results to overhaul Burnley.\nHaving won 3-2 at Chelsea on the opening day of last season, they swept into the lead through Hendrick's fine finish before showing their character to respond after falling 2-1 behind.\nTom Heaton's yellow card in the 32nd minute was the earliest for time-wasting by a goalkeeper in a Premier League match for five years.\nYet this was far from a conservative performance by the visitors, Burnley producing six shots in total - half on target - and Sean Dyche can now start planning for a fourth successive season in the Premier League.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nMatch stats - Hazard beats three-year assists haul\nChelsea have only lost one of their 21 Premier League matches played on a Monday at Stamford Bridge (W15 D5) - a 3-2 defeat by Manchester United on Boxing Day in 1994 under Glenn Hoddle.\nSince their 3-2 victory against Chelsea in this fixture last season, Burnley have failed to win any of their past 11 Premier League away games versus 'big six' opposition (D5 L6).\nChelsea conceded two goals from set-pieces (excluding penalties) in a single Premier League game at Stamford Bridge for the first time since May 2011 v Newcastle.\nJeff Hendrick's strike for Burnley's opener was the 1,000th goal Chelsea have conceded in the Premier League - the ninth club to do so.\nChelsea's Eden Hazard has provided 13 assists in the Premier League in 2018-19, the most in the competition this season and one more than he registered in his previous three seasons combined (12).\nChelsea's N'Golo Kante has scored four goals in 34 Premier League games this season, one more than he netted in his previous three campaigns combined (three goals in 106 appearances).\nAshley Barnes has scored 11 Premier League goals this season, the joint-most by a Burnley player in a single campaign along with Danny Ings in 2014-15.\nChelsea's Gonzalo Higua\u00edn has scored 10 or more league goals in each of his past 11 seasons (four for Chelsea, six for AC Milan in 2018-19).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea will now start preparing for Sunday's match at sixth-placed Manchester United (16:30 BST) - a game which will a long way to deciding who finishes in the top four. Burnley also have a big match on the same day - at home to title-chasing Manchester City (14:05)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-1 Southampton: Late Gray goal earns Watford point\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said his side are \"not safe yet\" after they conceded a 90th-minute equaliser to draw at Watford.\nShane Long had given the Saints an early lead when he scored the fastest goal in Premier League history.\nLong struck after just 7.69 seconds and Southampton held on to their lead until Watford's Andre Gray levelled from close range.\nSouthampton's point means they are two places and six points above the relegation zone with three games remaining.\n\"We have 37 points and until we have 40 we do not speak about being safe,\" said Hasenhuttl.\nLong broke the previous record - set by Ledley King of Spurs on 9 December 2000 - when he blocked a Craig Cathcart pass, before lifting the ball over Watford keeper Ben Foster.\nBut Gray's equaliser earned the hosts a point that moved them into seventh in the table, as the game finished as frantically as it began.\nSaints also struck the post twice before half-time as Watford struggled, although the hosts were much improved after the break and created several chances in the second half.\nSouthampton keeper Angus Gunn had just saved a Roberto Pereyra header from close range when a rebound in the area fell kindly for Gray, who shot powerfully past Gunn at the near post.\n\"Now we have a home game against Bournemouth. If you'd told me that we'd have a chance to secure safety in that game when I took over, I'd have taken that,\" added Hasenhuttl.\nWatford moved above Everton into seventh place to maintain their prospects of qualifying for the Europa League via their league position, although they also have the chance to play in Europe by winning the FA Cup final against Manchester City on 18 May.\nWatford shake off early shock and dig deep\nWatford were understandably stunned by Long's record-breaking goal, but Gray nearly equalised within a couple of minutes when Gunn saved a shot at close range.\nGray's header from the rebound looped over the bar, but Watford looked sluggish as the match calmed down following the frenetic start.\nWithout suspended captain Troy Deeney, Gerard Deulofeu was Watford's main threat in the first half with a shot that curled just wide of the post and another that fizzed across the face of goal.\nManager Javi Gracia had withdrawn Cathcart at half-time, with the introduction of Kiko Femenia and a move to three at the back helping to bring about some much-needed improvement.\nThere was much more urgency from home side in the second half, with Gray and Abdoulaye Doucoure having chances in the opening minutes.\nThey maintained the pressure throughout the half before Gray's late equaliser, although the lack of celebrations on the pitch seemed to suggest Watford were far from happy with just a point.\nSaints so close to a rapid hit-and-run\nFollowing Long's early strike, Southampton had more chances to earn what would have been a vital three points before half-time.\nFoster had deflected a shot from Nathan Redmond onto his near post, and Ryan Bertrand also struck the upright as the Saints looked to be comfortably controlling the game.\nLong's pace had been decisive in his goal and continued to trouble Watford, until Gracia's tactical switch at half-time saw the momentum shift in the home side's favour.\nA clever free-kick from James Ward-Prowse that nearly caught out Foster at his near post was as close as Hasenhuttl's side came to adding to Long's goal in the second half.\nA win over south coast neighbours Bournemouth on Saturday could ensure Southampton's safety, but there is a chance that the two points they let slip at Watford could still have the worst possible consequences.\nMan of the match - Andre Gray (Watford)\n'Shane's a good listener' - what the managers said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia: \"We conceded an early goal and it changed what we prepared, to concede after some seconds is hard to accept. In that moment they played better and had more chances, but in the second half we changed, found a better balance and created chances.\n\"I am sure Craig tried to play quickly, sometimes these things happen and in these moments we just try to focus and improve.\n\"We are getting some goals at the end of games, we show character and desire.\n\"For other teams it is difficult to win these games [at Vicarage Road], all the teams are trying for different targets.\"\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"We want to be aggressive and Longy listened very well. He was quick, too quick for the centre-back and it was a fantastic start.\n\"It shows that he can score and it's important for that we play a style that fits him well, because he's very quick.\n\"You could see we were struggling at the end, the pressure was high. The problem was we didn't score again in the first half, but we must take this point as it's a big one for us. With a game against Bournemouth at home we can take the final step.\n\"I am always positive because I see how our team plays. We have showed we can take points off every opponent.\"\nSaints throwing it away - the stats you may have missed\nSouthampton have dropped a league-high 25 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season.\nThis is the first time Watford have accumulated as many as 50 points in a Premier League season, last doing so in the top flight in 1986-87 (63).\nWatford have conceded at least once in their last nine Premier League games, the longest current run without a clean sheet in the competition.\nSouthampton have lost just one of their last 10 top-flight away games against Watford, although seven of those have ended level (W2).\nSouthampton striker Shane Long has scored three goals in his last four Premier League games, as many as he had in his previous 60 matches in the competition.\nAndre Gray has scored four goals in his last six home games for Watford in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nWatford are at home to Wolves on Saturday, 27 April with a 15:00 BST kick-off. Southampton host Bournemouth in a south coast derby at the same time."

        "article_text": "Tottenham 1-0 Brighton: Christian Eriksen gives Spurs vital home win\nChristian Eriksen's stunning late winner finally ended Brighton's resistance to boost Tottenham's hopes of a top-four finish in the Premier League.\nBrighton were on course to gain a point in their battle to avoid relegation before the Denmark playmaker - Spurs' most effective attacking player throughout - shot low into the corner from 25 yards in the 88th minute.\nSpurs defender Toby Alderweireld had earlier hit the post while his team-mates Lucas Moura and Dele Alli both had efforts cleared off the goalline.\nBrighton, without a goal in seven matches, were restricted to counter attacks and set pieces, with the impressive central defensive pairing of Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy both heading off target.\nThird-placed Tottenham are now three points ahead of Chelsea and four clear of Arsenal in fifth, although the Gunners have a game in hand.\nBrighton - who have to play both Arsenal and title-chasing Manchester City - remain 17th, three points clear of third-bottom Cardiff with three matches of the season remaining.\nAnalysis and reaction from Tuesday's Premier League matches\nSpurs clinch victory in 'must-win' game\nBefore the match Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino described the game as a \"must win\" so will be relieved his side eventually converted their 78% possession into a decisive moment with their 29th effort at goal.\nIt was always likely to be Eriksen who unlocked Brighton's well-organised defence given he had created his side's best chances.\nHis early cross was headed over by Belgium defender Jan Vertonghen then minutes later England's Alli narrowly failed to get a touch on another Eriksen delivery.\nBrazil forward Moura was also played in by Eriksen and although his shot evaded Seagulls keeper Mat Ryan, it was cleared off the line by Dunk - whose centre-back partner Duffy denied Alli in similar fashion soon after.\nSpurs continued to create chances in the second half with Eriksen and Son Heung-min both shooting over before Danny Rose forced a fine one-handed save from Ryan.\nAlderweireld's shot on the turn from the edge of the penalty area hit the inside of the post and bounced out and Spurs were so desperate for a goal that they turned to striker Vincent Janssen for his first Spurs appearance since August 2017.\nThere looked to be minimal danger when Alli slid a pass to Eriksen 40 yards out but his fine strike from outside the area defeated Ryan to earn his side three points.\nBrighton's luck runs out\nBrighton face a battle to extend their run in the top flight for a third consecutive year, especially as their final two matches are away at Arsenal before ending the season at home to Manchester City.\nTottenham had not been involved in a goalless draw in their past 67 Premier League games but Dunk and Duffy were so solid for the visitors that the run looked likely to end.\nBrighton had conceded seven goals in two games before a goalless draw at Wolves on Saturday and were only two minutes away from another clean sheet thanks to their resilient defending.\nBut the problems for Chris Hughton's side lie at the other end of the field as they have now not scored in the Premier League since their 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on 9 March.\nHughton latest attempt to find a goal resulted in top goalscorer Glenn Murray being named a substitute in one of six changes to his starting line-up.\nBrighton were perhaps fortunate that Florin Andone was not dismissed after he was booked in the 35th minute for a foul on Rose and then within 60 seconds fouling Kieran Trippier.\nReferee Christopher Kavanagh opted against a second yellow but the Seagulls' luck ran out with only two minutes remaining.\nAnother win in the new stadium - the stats\nTottenham have won all four of their home games in all competitions since moving into their stadium, scoring eight goals and conceding none.\nBrighton have failed to score in seven consecutive games in all competitions for the first time ever.\nTottenham attempted 21 shots from outside the box, the most by a team in a Premier League game since Liverpool also registered 21 against Chelsea in April 2014.\nBrighton faced 29 shots in the game, the most against them in a Premier League game.\nSpurs' haul of 29 shots overall in the game was their most in a Premier League fixture since they mustered 31 against West Ham in January 2018.\nSpurs have not lost a Premier League home game on a Tuesday since August 2007 (1-3 vs Everton), winning eight and drawing one since then.\nBrighton have lost all 11 of their Premier League away games against 'big six' opponents, conceding 23 goals and scoring just twice.\nSince his Premier League debut in September 2013, Tottenham's Christian Eriksen has scored 21 goals from outside the box in the competition, more than any other player.\nMan of the match - Lewis Dunk (Brighton)\n'The changing room is very down' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a difficult game, we knew how difficult it would be, how tough it is to break down the opposition.\n\"Brighton were a really brave opponent. The most important thing is we believed, didn't give up and tried different ways to score.\n\"It is three very important points and to be in a good position in the table. The team are doing a fantastic effort after tough games against Manchester City.\n\"The team are not as fresh as we wanted, not just legs, but minds, so we have to congratulate the players. I'm so proud of them.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton, speaking to BBC Sport: \"There are some games where you think the other team are going to open you up and the longer the game went on they were pushing bodies forward but I thought we were going to get a point.\n\"We had opportunities to manage the game better at the end and those are the details that are crucial against a team of the quality of Tottenham. The changing room at the moment is very down because of the manner of the defeat.\n\"We've got three games and we have to make sure we get enough points to secure our status in this division. The pressure comes with the territory and we'll have to deal with it.\"\nOn going seven games without scoring: \"We've found it difficult in the opposition half and the final third. What we have done is got back to ourselves in terms of resilience.\n\"We've never been big goalscorers but in whichever way we can, we need to get it somehow and we have an opportunity at home against Newcastle on Saturday.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham take on West Ham in the early game on Saturday (12:30 BST), before Brighton play at home against Newcastle later on the same day (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 3-1 Arsenal: Gunners miss chance to go fourth in Premier League\nArsenal missed the chance to go fourth in the Premier League as they were outplayed by Wolves at Molineux.\nRuben Neves put the hosts ahead with a direct free-kick from 25 yards before Matt Doherty headed in a second.\nDiogo Jota added a third just before half-time after the Gunners gave the ball away and he ran at the away defence before firing a shot under goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\nArsenal defender Sokratis headed in from Granit Xhaka's corner in the 80th minute but it was not enough for the Gunners.\nThe victory takes Wolves up from 10th to seventh, while Arsenal remain fifth, one point adrift of fourth-placed Chelsea and four behind north London rivals Tottenham.\nEmery still confident of Champions League spot\nWith three games left of the season, Wolves are in contention to qualify for Europe.\nIf Manchester City beat Watford in the FA Cup final the team finishing seventh in the Premier League will take the last available European spot and enter next season's Europa League at the second qualifying round phase.\nReaction and analysis from Wednesday's Premier League matches.\nWolves impress again against a top-six side\nWolves' win continues a remarkable campaign for Nuno Espirito Santo's side in their first season since winning promotion from the Championship.\nThe hosts went into the match without a win in three games in all competitions but were on top even when the game was goalless as Joao Moutinho curled wide from 25 yards and Raul Jimenez just failed to connect with Jonny's through ball.\nNeves then gave Wolves a deserved lead in the 28th minute with a fine free-kick after Nacho Monreal had clumsily bundled over Jonny in a central position.\nA well-worked move from a short corner - albeit with Arsenal's defenders not applying pressure - left Jonny with space to cross and Doherty got to the ball before Leno to head into the net and double his side's lead.\nAnother Arsenal error led to Wolves' third as the ball was given away to Jota, who drove forward and shot under Leno, who should have done better.\nThis win means Wolves have picked up 16 points in their matches against the current top six this season, a record that includes wins over Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester United and now Arsenal.\nWolves are also aiming to become the first newly promoted side to finish in the top eight since Reading finished eighth in 2005-06, while no promoted team has finished higher than that since Ipswich Town were fifth in 2000-01.\nTired Arsenal struggle again\nFor Arsenal it was a second successive defeat after they lost 3-2 to Crystal Palace on Sunday.\nManager Unai Emery made seven changes to his starting line-up from that match, although he was without the injured Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - the Premier League's joint-top goalscorer with 19 goals in 2018-19.\nWithout him, a tired-looking Gunners side struggled to create chances, with Mesut Ozil ineffective and Alexandre Lacazette seeing little of the ball.\nThe France forward did make one opportunity out of nothing when he skipped past Willy Boly and Jonny, but he then shot well wide in his only attempt.\nSokratis' header from Xhaka's right-wing corner in the 80th minute gave Arsenal hope, but they could not find further goals to gain the point that would have taken them above Chelsea.\nEmery's side did not in truth deserve anything and the Spaniard will be furious at the three goals conceded - a needless free-kick given away for the first, the defence switching off to enable Jonny to cross for the second and his side losing possession in the build-up to Jota's third.\nThis is the second successive season the Gunners have been without Champions League football, although they are still in the semi-finals of the Europa League and if they win it they will qualify automatically for the top tier of European football next season.\nTo secure that prize through a top-four Premier League finish, they now need Tottenham or Chelsea to slip up.\nMan of the match - Ruben Neves (Wolves)\nFirst Wolves win over Arsenal in almost 40 years - the stats\nWolves ended their 20-game winless streak against Arsenal (drew four, lost 16), with a first victory against the Gunners in all competitions since September 1979.\nThis was Arsenal's heaviest Premier League defeat against a promoted team since a 2-0 loss to Newcastle United in May 1994.\nWolves are one of three promoted sides to have beaten at least four sides to finish that season in the top six in a single Premier League campaign, after Sunderland in 1996-97 and Blackburn in 1992-93.\nWolves are the first promoted team to earn 50 points in a Premier League season since Birmingham in 2009-10.\nDiogo Jota has been directly involved in seven goals in his last five Premier League appearances for Wolves at Molineux (five goals, two assists).\nWolves' Ruben Neves has more goals (four) than he has touches (three) in the opposition's box in the Premier League this season.\nOnly Charlie Mulgrew (10) and Harry Wilson (nine) have scored more goals from outside the box since the start of last season in the top four tiers in England than Wolves' Neves (eight).\n'We can recover for the top four' - what they said\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Sport: \"It was very good, especially in the first half, but we conceded too much possession in the second.\n\"Arsenal have quality, they move the ball and keep it well and it's hard to recover it. But until we conceded the goal we did not concede many chances.\n\"It was very good in the first half, very compact.\"\nArsenal manager Unai Emery told BBC Sport: \"We knew before the match it was going to be difficult because all season Wolverhampton are feeling strong, defensively they are a good team and offensively they have very fast players.\n\"Their organisation was very good and to break this was going to be difficult.\n\"In the first 25 minutes we started very well, controlled the possession but did not have many chances to score.\n\"We spoke in the dressing room at half-time and we tried to see it as a new match and in the second half we changed our performance and scored a goal. We can be frustrated but the Premier League is about being consistent over 38 matches.\n\"Today we're disappointed but we need to remember how we were three months ago. We can be optimistic and recover for the top four.\"\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are away at Leicester in the Premier League on Sunday (12:00 BST) before they entertain Valencia in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday, 2 May (20:00 BST).\nWolves face an important match in their quest to finish seventh as they play at eighth-placed Watford on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

Two big questions. Two big answers from Manchester City.\nThe biggest question of all - who will be champions? - remains to be answered, but at least City know it remains in their hands.\nMan Utd look lost\nIf United and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were looking for a crumb of comfort from a chastening night, it was that they at least performed with a little more respectability than when they were trounced 4-0 at Everton on Sunday.\nAnd that was about it.\nIn every other respect, the flaws which make the gulf in class between these two clubs so huge was brutally exposed by City.\nUnited were outmanoeuvred in all areas of the pitch, with De Gea's current decline emphasised by his questionable role in both goals.\nWhether it is ongoing contract negotiations or a malaise from this troubled season at Old Trafford, De Gea is light years away from the keeper who had earned such a glittering reputation.\nHow did Liverpool fans cope with cheering on Man Utd?\nSee how the players rated in Manchester derby\nPremier League title race - predict the winners and top six\nUnited sank fast after City went ahead, Old Trafford a sea of thousands of empty red seats as City went through their party pieces to close out the win.\nPaul Pogba was again poor, even suffering the ignominy of losing a straight aerial challenge to the diminutive Raheem Sterling, while Fred had a nightmare alongside him.\nCity supporters responded to the Stretford End chants of \"Ole's At The Wheel\" with \"The Wheels Are Falling Off\", although United are still in the hunt for a top-four place.\nThe away fans had a point after United's seventh defeat in nine games in all competitions and are now without a clean sheet in 12 games, their worst record since August 1971.\nUnited are currently not even in City's shadow and the scale of the task facing Solskjaer is becoming ever more stark with each defeat.\nMan of the match - Bernardo Silva (Manchester City)\n'They are the best team in the country' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We play with a lot of pressure. They were playing for Champions League qualification. After their 4-0 defeat by Everton, we knew their players would be committed.\n\"We lost some balls in the middle of the pitch in the first half and they had counter-attacks. We did well to win the game in the second half. Fortunately we made an incredible second half.\"\nCould Fernandinho have played on? \"Maybe but he had a problem at half-time in both legs. When he went down we made the change. I thought of putting Leroy Sane in - left foot on the left and right foot on the right. He helped us a lot.\n\"We increased the level for the Premier League last season with 100 points. That's the level.\n\"Liverpool are chasing. What they have done is incredible but it's in our hands. Going to Burnley will be tough and trying to play our game.\"\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We got a great reaction from the players and the supporters.\n\"You could see from the first minute that they wanted to show the crowd, who were incredible again.\n\"The first half was decent. We held our own and created chances with some efforts. Going into half-time, we know there was a lot of work to be done, but they won deservedly because they had too much for us.\n\"They are the best team in the country. They have set the standard in the last two seasons and I don't know how many points they've taken.\n\"What Pep Guardiola has done with his players is remarkable and we are so close to it - in the vicinity - so we feel it every day.\n\"We are disappointed but you can look at yourself and say we gave everything.\n\"We need to do that tomorrow and the next day. It's about doing everything you can to close it [the gap].\"\nMan City break scoring record - the stats\nManchester City have won seven away Premier League against Manchester United at Old Trafford, more than any other team.\nUnited have now lost seven of their past nine games in all competitions (W2 D0 L7), after losing only one of their first 17 under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (W14 D2 L1).\nCity have scored 157 goals in all competitions this season - the most by an English top-flight side in a single season.\nCity boss Pep Guardiola is the first manager to win three consecutive away Premier League matches at Old Trafford against United and only the third to win three away matches there, along with Arsenal's Arsene Wenger and Liverpool's Gerard Houllier.\nUnited are without a clean sheet in 12 consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since August 1971.\nIn combining for the second goal, Leroy Sane (10 goals, 10 assists) and Raheem Sterling (17 goals, 10 assists) both reached 10 goals and 10 assists in the league this season.

        "article_text": "Liverpool 5-0 Huddersfield Town: Rampant Reds regain top spot\nLiverpool once again put the pressure back on Manchester City as they returned to the top of the Premier League with an emphatic win over Huddersfield at Anfield.\nJurgen Klopp's side are now two points clear of the reigning champions, who have a game in hand, with Naby Keita's goal after 15 seconds setting the tone for a dominant display.\nWinning possession high in Huddersfield territory, the Guinea midfielder swept a close-range effort into the bottom left corner from Mohamed Salah's pass to record the Reds' quickest goal in a Premier League match.\nIt was also Liverpool's 100th goal in all competitions this term, and they doubled their lead when Sadio Mane glanced Andrew Robertson's superb cross into the bottom right corner.\nSalah then lobbed Town goalkeeper Jonas Lossl on the stroke of half-time to deliver a third after running on to Trent Alexander-Arnold's ball forward.\nWhile Huddersfield twice went close to scoring through Juninho Bacuna and Karlan Grant, it remained largely one-way traffic after the break.\nSalah and Keita both went close to their second goals of the evening before Mane headed in his second from Jordan Henderson's cross to briefly become the Premier League's joint-top scorer, on 20 goals.\nHowever his Egyptian team-mate Salah regained that honour, converting from another Robertson delivery in the closing stages to move on to 21 goals, sealing a fine team performance.\nLiverpool have now amassed more points than Arsenal's unbeaten \"Invincibles\" team of 2003-04 and have 12 points more than the Manchester United Treble-winning team of 1998-99.\nNo team has ever reached this number of points (91) and not gone on to win the title.\nManchester City, though, can regain top spot if they win their game in hand at Burnley on Sunday (14:05 BST), after which both teams have two games left.\nSalah's goals tally is a bigger achievement this season - Klopp\nUsual suspects spark rampant Reds\nIf there were fears this could turn into a nervy occasion, they were quickly dispelled by a lightning-fast start in which visiting midfielder Jon Gorenc Stankovic was robbed of possession for Keita's opener.\nLiverpool's high press was hardly unexpected but it did the early damage before the usual suspects took over.\nRobertson displayed the form that has seen him rewarded with a place in the PFA's Premier League Team of the Year, driving forward from left-back at every opportunity.\nHis contribution to Mane's first goal and Salah's second saw him equal a Premier League record of 11 assists from a defender in a season.\nMane, who was also endorsed by his contemporaries and is a contender for the main PFA Player of the Year award on Sunday, showcased his ability to find space between defenders, directing two excellent headers past Lossl to record his 19th and 20th league goals of a prolific season.\nThat ensured Liverpool became the first club to have two players score 20 goals or more in a Premier League season since Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge accomplished the same feat in 2013-14, also for the Reds.\nSalah's two-goal return also saw him become only the third Liverpool player to pass 20 or more Premier League goals in consecutive seasons for the club, placing him in the same company as Robbie Fowler (1994-95 and 1995-96) and Luis Suarez (2012-13 and 2013-14).\nHis overall tally of 69 goals in 100 games does, however, separate him from those former heroes and is the highest number of goals managed by any Liverpool player after a century of appearances.\nKlopp will have also been satisfied with his team's fluency in attack even without Roberto Firmino, who was nursing a thigh injury.\nThe Brazilian is expected to be fit for Wednesday's Champions League semi-final first leg at Barcelona, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who returned from injury to make his first appearance since April 2018, will also bolster his options.\nHuddersfield surrender to gulf in quality\nAt the same stage last term, Huddersfield were still embroiled in a fight for Premier League survival - but this campaign has struck an entirely different tone.\nDavid Wagner - the architect of that triumph and the Terriers' first promotion to the top flight since 1972 - left in January and his successor Jan Siewert has been unable to recalibrate their fortunes.\nThis thumping defeat leaves Town with just four points from the last 69 available and a compendium of unwanted records loom.\nThe 77-point difference between them and Liverpool represents the biggest gap between the top and bottom club since the Premier League was formed.\nAnd this loss - their 28th of the season - moved them within one of the Premier League record for the most defeats, which is currently shared by Ipswich, Sunderland and Derby.\nWith two games to go against Manchester United and at Southampton, there is now the realistic prospect they could end up as the sole owners of that undesirable tag.\nTheir failings here were symptomatic of their season; albeit the quality of their opponents only exacerbated them.\nStankovic - a defender deployed in midfield - lacked the awareness to shift the ball away from Keita, giving the visitors an early mountain to climb.\nAnd both of Mane's headers were too easily dispatched against a side that has now conceded 74 goals in 36 games.\nWhile endeavour was not absent - Huddersfield covered more ground than their opponents (111.97km to 110.34km) - the visitors' failure to capitalise on promising situations made for a comfortable night for the hosts.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\n'We scored wonderful goals' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"We are happy with the points we have and now we are focused on the next game. We have a mindset that works and we try to create problems for each opponent by working hard.\n\"It's obviously an outstanding group of players, who did well against a Huddersfield side who are much better than the result shows. They had proper counter-attacks so we needed to be patient and we scored wonderful goals.\"\nHuddersfield manager Jan Siewart: \"I feel for the player who made the mistake and everyone felt sorry for him. I have to take care of my player because he is a fantastic character. He was outstanding against Wolves but today he made a mistake and we all have to back him.\n\"No-one expected us to be brave and we could easily have put on our helmets and sit on the back foot but we put them under pressure. This is how I want to continue with my work because I know it will deliver results.\n\"Jurgen Klopp has proved that at Liverpool where he came in and changed the system. We all knew they could punish us but I am proud of the way we created chances.\"\nImpregnable Anfield - the stats\nLiverpool have accrued 91 points in the Premier League this season, their second-highest ever total in a single league season (converting to three for a win) in their history, behind only 98 points in 1978-79, which was a 42-game season.\nLiverpool have won 10 consecutive matches in all competitions, their best winning run since May 2006 when they won 11 on the bounce.\nHuddersfield have now lost 28 Premier League matches this season - they have never lost more league matches in a single campaign in their history (also 28 in 1987-88 in the second tier).\nLiverpool are now unbeaten in 19 matches across all competitions (W14, D5), their longest such streak since a run of 20 without defeat between December 1995 and March 1996.\nThis victory means Liverpool will end Friday top of the Premier League - it is the 29th time that the lead has changed hands at the end of a day this season, the outright post-war top-flight record, overtaking 28 times in 2001-02.\nHuddersfield have now failed to score in each of their last nine meetings with Liverpool in all competitions; this is Liverpool's joint-second longest run of clean sheets against an opponent in their history, behind only a 10-match streak against West Brom in August 2010 (also nine v Everton in April 1976).\nLiverpool have now earned 50 points at Anfield this season, their best ever tally at home in a Premier League season (previously 49 in 2013-14), with this the first top-flight season they have reached 50 points at home since 1987-88 (also 50).\nNo defender in Premier League history has assisted more goals in a single season in the competition than Liverpool's Andrew Robertson (11), moving level with Leighton Baines in 2010-11 and Andy Hinchcliffe in 1994-95.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Barcelona for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on 1 May (20:00 BST) before resuming their Premier League duties on Saturday, 4 May at Newcastle (19:45 BST).\nHuddersfield host Manchester United in their next Premier League game on Sunday, 5 May (14:00 BST)."

We are competing with circumstances that are not the best,\" Pochettino said.\n\"We arrived for this game in a different condition and that was an important factor in the second half. It was really tough today.\n\"We cannot say now we were thinking about Tuesday.\n\"We wanted to win the three points to be in our position and arrive to the Champions League game in a very good mood and way, but it wasn't and now we need to move on.\"\nThird-placed Spurs had won all four of their games since moving into Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this month.\nAntonio's goal in the 67th minute was the first they had conceded at home since moving into their new stadium and means they are not yet certain of finishing in the top four and securing Champions League football next season.\nVictory ended a run of four games without a win for West Ham, who remain 11th in the table with two games to play this season.\nThey finished strongly, with Antonio and defender Issa Diop forcing Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris into saves in the closing stages, although West Ham's Fabian Balbuena cleared a Vincent Janssen header off the line in stoppage time.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nSpurs lack spark\nSpurs' prolonged wait to play in their rebuilt home was worth the wait before West Ham's visit, with three league wins and a 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the first leg of their epic Champions League quarter-final.\nBut there had been signs of strain when they struggled to overcome relegation-threatened Brighton in their previous match.\nPochettino made four changes to the side that played Brighton but, after a good start, his players appeared to run out of steam.\nSon Heung-min's low strike forced West Ham keeper Lucasz Fabianski into a save at his near post, while a Lucas Moura shot zipped across the face of goal before half-time.\nChristian Eriksen also forced Fabianski into action, this time with his feet, but West Ham were happy to counter-attack from the outset.\n\"We did not manage the ball properly,\" Pochettino said. \"It was a difficult game but in the second half we conceded a lot of space for them to counter-attack.\n\"The first half was good but we lost the ball too easily in the second half.\"\nWest Ham were the better side after the break, and the game was deep into stoppage time when substitute Janssen almost earned Spurs a point.\nWith Spurs playing 24 hours before Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United - all of whom are vying for a place in the top four - Pochettino said, \"It is a fight, it is a race, with two games to play. We knew that before.\"\nRare road trip joy for Hammers\nWith just 16 points taken since their league campaign's halfway point before this game, West Ham's season was in danger of petering out.\nHaving earned only one point from their past eight away trips, the signs were not promising for an improvement.\nBut, after a first half in which Fabianski was the busier of the two keepers, West Ham looked the likelier to score after half-time.\n\"We were a complete team, defending together without the ball,\" manager Manuel Pellegrini said.\n\"This is a transition season. We have demonstrated in big games that we can do it, but we must mentally convince ourselves that we can do better.\"\nMarko Arnautovic touched the ball only seven times in the first half, but a superb piece of control to give Ryan Fredericks a shooting chance early on signalled a better second-half display from the striker and his team-mates.\nArnautovic set up the game's decisive moment, chipping the ball from the right into the path of Antonio, who controlled it with his chest before firing past Lloris from a tight angle.\n\"Arnautovic was very good,\" said Pellegrini. \"He made a brilliant pass for Antonio's goal. It has been a difficult season but I am sure that we will recover the player that he could be.\nThere was also the unlikely sight of Diop's long gallop through the middle of the pitch for a shot that lacked enough power to worry Lloris.\nBut there was also excellent work from Balbuena off the line in injury time, and a superb tackle in the area by Fredericks on Ben Davies, to help West Ham earn only their third away win of the season.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio (West Ham)\nArnautovic the assist king - the stats\nTottenham have lost 17 games in all competitions this season, their most since 2008-09 (19).\nWest Ham kept an away clean sheet for the first time in their past 10 league games, since a 2-0 win at Fulham in December.\nTottenham have lost six of their past 10 league games (W3 D1), as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 28 (W22).\nOnly Jose Mourinho (5) has beaten Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino more often in the Premier League than Manuel Pellegrini (4, level with Pep Guardiola).\nMichail Antonio's goal was the first Tottenham had conceded at their new stadium in 427 minutes in all competitions.\nAll 26 of Antonio's Premier League goals have come from inside the box.\nMarko Arnautoic has provided more assists than any other West Ham player in the Premier League since the start of last season (10).\nWhat's next?\nSpurs take on Ajax at home in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday at 20:00 BST.

        "article_text": "Fulham 1-0 Cardiff City: Craven Cottage defeat hits Bluebirds' survival hopes\nCardiff City's hopes of Premier League survival are hanging by the thinnest of threads after Ryan Babel's beautiful curling strike consigned them to defeat at already-relegated Fulham.\nChances were scarce in a disjointed first half which included a long delay as Fulham's Denis Odoi was taken off on a stretcher after he was accidentally kicked in the head by his team-mate Maxime Le Marchand.\nThe entertainment improved after the break, with both sides playing with greater urgency and creating several chances to score before Babel struck with a brilliant first-time effort from 20 yards to break Cardiff hearts.\nNeil Warnock's side rallied with a flurry of late efforts on goal which prompted a string of fine saves from Fulham goalkeeper Sergio Rico - but those exertions proved in vain.\nCardiff remain 18th in the Premier League table, four points behind Brighton - and with a goal difference 14 worse than the Seagulls - with only two games to play this season.\nBrighton came from behind to draw 1-1 with Newcastle in Saturday's late kick-off although Cardiff fans will take heart from the fact the Seagulls face Arsenal and Manchester City in their final two fixtures.\nRelive Fulham's victory over Cardiff\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nCardiff's valiant effort in vain\nWritten off at the start of the season, and dealt several setbacks over the course of the campaign, Cardiff seem to have been clinging on to their Premier League status for what seems like an age.\nThey simply would not go away - a pugnacious outfit built in the image of their manager Warnock, unwilling to follow Fulham by making an instant return to the Championship.\nHowever, this result might mean the Bluebirds will be unable to avoid that fate. Because of Brighton's superior goal difference Cardiff must effectively win both their remaining fixtures to have a chance of staying up.\nAt Craven Cottage they battled valiantly and defended diligently but, as has often been the case this season, they lacked the quality to really trouble their opponents.\nSet-pieces seemed Cardiff's likeliest route to a goal as they struggled to conjure the kind of nous and touch required to fashion scoring opportunities in open play.\nWith Storm Hannah still making itself felt with blustery winds on the banks of the Thames, the Welsh side looked to exploit the conditions by sending a series of free-kicks and throws swirling into the Fulham box.\nFollowing one free-kick launched from the halfway line by Lee Peltier, captain Sean Morrison was manhandled by Aleksandar Mitrovic but had his appeals for a penalty ignored by referee Chris Kavanagh.\nIt was not until they fell behind that Cardiff truly threatened; Junior Hoilett hitting the crossbar with one effort before Morrison and Danny Ward forced Rico into action.\nBut by then the writing was already on the wall.\nCardiff confounded expectations by winning promotion in the first place and, even by Warnock and his players' odds-defying standards, avoiding relegation from their current predicament would be an escape act of Houdini proportions.\nFulham's schadenfreude\nThese two sides were adversaries before they were locked in this battle to avoid relegation, having both vied for automatic promotion from the Championship last season.\nFulham were widely regarded as the neutrals' choice with their aesthetically-pleasing style. However, it was Cardiff who prevailed with their less attractive but ultimately more effective approach, with Fulham eventually promoted via the play-offs.\nThat clash of styles prompted a fair bit of debate - and bickering - between the two sets of fans and, while most of it was good natured, there was a sense at Craven Cottage that Fulham's supporters wanted their side to drag Cardiff down to the second tier with them.\nThey had reason to be confident of doing so because, after their relegation was confirmed on 2 April following a ninth successive defeat, the Cottagers actually won their matches against Everton and Bournemouth.\nOn this occasion, they initially reverted to the kind of form which saw them sink into the bottom three; struggling to play with any fluency as they seemed unsettled by Cardiff's uncompromising approach.\nThe home side improved in the second half and, after Mitrovic squandered a handful of chances, Babel sent his dipping, arcing 20-yard shot over the despairing dive of Neil Etheridge to give interim Fulham manager Scott Parker a third successive victory.\nIf anyone was in any doubt about how much Fulham's fans enjoyed beating Cardiff and contributing to their probable relegation, they offered an unequivocal answer in the form of their gleeful chant: \"You're going down with the Fulham.\"\nMan of the match - Ryan Babel (Fulham)\n'A special goal' - what they said\nFulham caretaker boss Scott Parker: \"Ryan Babel's goal was special. He has come up with a fantastic strike and won us the game.\n\"Also it was a massive positive for goalkeeper Sergio Rico, he stood up and so did the back four.\n\"It has been a tough year, we have conceded a lot of goals but three clean sheets is massive.\"\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock: \"I am disappointed but could not have asked anymore of them. We couldn't have scored if we carried on till Christmas.\n\"The luck has been against us. On reflection my team selection was wrong, but you can't fault the lads. Who is to say we are not still in the fight?\n\"You see the chances, we should score some of those chances. You pay for your finishers in this league, we have never been blessed with that, Emiliano Sala would have been that and that was a big blow.\"\nCapital punishment for Warnock - the stats\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock has never won an away Premier League match in London in 16 attempts (W0 D3 L13).\nFulham have won three consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since March 2012.\nThis was Cardiff City's 13th away Premier League defeat of the season - only Huddersfield (14) and Fulham (15) have lost more.\nFulham have taken nine points from their past three Premier League games - as many as in their previous 20 games combined (W2 D3 L15).\nCardiff had eight shots on target in this match - with all seven coming in the 73rd minute or later.\nFulham's Ryan Babel scored his 17th Premier League goal and his first from outside the box.\nWhat's next?\nCardiff are back in the Welsh capital for a match against Crystal Palace on Saturday, 4 May in the day's 17:30 BST kick-off, while earlier in the day (15:00) Fulham travel to Wolves."

Bennett's loose ball was intercepted by Deulofeu, who attempted to round Watford goalkeeper Rui Patricio.\nThe Portuguese custodian got a hand to the ball, but Gray was on hand to lash home the equaliser for his seventh league goal of the campaign.\nUnfortunately for the hosts, that proved to be their only shot on target in the whole 90 minutes.\nIf the Hornets finish outside the top seven, they will have to beat Manchester City in next month's FA Cup final to qualify for Europe.\nMan of the match - Diogo Jota (Wolves)\nNo home comforts for Hornets - the stats\nWatford have won just three of their last nine Premier League home games, drawing three and losing three.\nWolves ended a run of five Premier League away games without a win (D2 L3), after winning three of the five before that.\nRaul Jimenez has been directly involved in 20 Premier League goals for Wolves this season (13 goals, 7 assists), the fourth-biggest haul in a campaign by a non-British player for a newly promoted side (Bryan Roy - 24 for Nottingham Forest in 94/95, Niall Quinn - 22 for Sunderland in 99/00 and Peter Odemwingie - 22 for West Brom in 10/11).\nAll five of Diogo Jota's assists for Wolves this season have been for Raul Jimenez, the most Premier League assists exclusively for one player by another.\nJota has had a hand in seven goals in his last eight Premier League games (4 goals, 3 assists), as many as he managed in his previous 23.\nAndre Gray has scored five goals in his last seven home games for Watford in all competitions, having netted just three in his first 23 appearances at Vicarage Road for the Hornets.\nSince the start of 2016/17, Watford's Jose Holebas has picked up 33 yellow cards in the Premier League, more than any other player.\n'Seventh doesn't guarantee anything' - what the managers said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a close game like all the games against them. After we scored a goal in the second half we were playing better. We then conceded a soft goal.\n\"I think something about the team and not one player. In the last games we are conceding avoidable goals - we need to improve to get better results.\n\"We were improving but in our best moment we conceded a goal. We have two important games and then we have an FA Cup final.\n\"We want to achieve the best position. Before we had chances to qualify for Europe, and after this game it's the same.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It feels good because the boys worked hard. I think it was reward for the work of the boys against a very tough and difficult opponent.\n\"Jota and Jimenez have been working really hard. I truly believe the more time they spend together the more good things will happen.\n\"Maybe I'm the only one in the country that knows that seventh position doesn't guarantee anything. It's not about finishing as high as possible, but it's about finishing as well as possible.\"\nWhat's next?\nWolves welcome already relegated Fulham to Molineux next Saturday (15:00 BST), while Watford travel to face top-four hopefuls Chelsea the following day (14:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 3-3 Bournemouth: Hasenhuttl praises players as Saints secure safety\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl praised his side's \"amazing\" achievement after an entertaining draw with Bournemouth secured their Premier League survival.\nThe Saints were 18th with only nine points from 15 games when Hasenhuttl replaced the sacked Mark Hughes in December.\nHowever, they have now taken 29 points from the 21 league games since the Austrian took over, and this draw - along with Cardiff's 1-0 defeat at Fulham - guaranteed Southampton's safety with two games to go.\n\"We're very happy now - we deserve this,\" said Hasenhuttl. \"We had to take a lot of points, it's amazing, and to be clear [of relegation] two games before the end is fantastic for us. We've learned a lot and showed how beautiful we can play.\n\"This summer we will rebuild. We can start planning for next year tomorrow and the target [next season] is to get 40 points earlier than this year. A bit less stress would be nice.\"\nRelive Southampton v Bournemouth as it happened\nReaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League matches\nShane Long gave the hosts a deserved 12th-minute lead with a shot that took a deflection off of Nathan Ake following Nathan Redmond's pass.\nBut Bournemouth equalised with their first shot of the match when Dan Gosling finished off a quick counter-attack after being set up by Callum Wilson.\nLong then could only hit the post with an open goal before Wilson put Bournemouth ahead from a rebound as Angus Gunn could not hold on to David Brooks' effort.\nHowever, Saints fought back and James Ward-Prowse's low strike made it 2-2 before substitute Matt Targett headed the hosts in front from Yan Valery's right-wing cross.\nBut Wilson grabbed his second - and Bournemouth's third - late on, bundling the ball home from close range after Ryan Fraser's run.\nDespite not getting the victory, Cardiff's loss at Fulham meant the draw was enough for Southampton. Their players celebrated on the pitch, with chants of \"we are staying up\" ringing around St Mary's.\nA thrilling south coast derby\nIn front of a capacity crowd, this south coast derby proved to be a thrilling and hugely enjoyable encounter.\nThe Saints took a deserved lead through Long before Bournemouth gained a surprise equaliser with a fine move finished off by Gosling.\nLong should have restored the hosts' advantage but produced one of the misses of the season when he hit the post with an empty goal from only a few yards out after Artur Boruc had parried his first effort.\nInstead, Wilson gave the Cherries a half-time lead, but the hosts equalised within eight minutes of the restart.\nA powerful header from substitute Targett - his first Southampton goal - swung the match back in the Saints' favour, before Wilson's second with four minutes remaining brought it level again.\nWith Gareth Southgate watching on, the England international had a chance for a hat-trick to seal the win for Bournemouth, but Gunn made a fine save to deny Wilson when he was through on goal.\nAfter the final whistle at St Mary's, the home players faced an anxious wait for confirmation of Cardiff's defeat before the celebrations could start.\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson (Bournemouth)\nAnother Fraser assist - the stats\nSouthampton have lost 27 points from leading positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nBournemouth have taken seven points from their last four away league games (won two, drawn one) after taking none from the nine before that.\nSouthampton's Shane Long has scored in three successive home Premier League games for the first time.\nBournemouth's Dan Gosling has netted two goals in his last three league appearances, as many as he had managed in his previous 67.\nBournemouth's Callum Wilson has scored and assisted in six different Premier League games this season, more than any other player.\nJames Ward-Prowse has scored seven goals in the league this season for Southampton (24 apps), as many as he had managed in his two previous seasons combined (60 apps).\nRyan Fraser has provided 13 assists in the league this season, a joint-high figure in the competition (level with Eden Hazard).\n'A lot of heart and spirit' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: \"It was a crazy game - a tremendous match. I'm very happy to be in the best league in the world. Every weekend is a tremendous experience.\n\"Every day I enjoy this job very much. It's everything I expected from the Premier League.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe to BBC Sport: \"So much to talk about. Not a perfect display from either side but there was a lot of heart and spirit. Good goals, poor defending. We've got to be pleased with the way we came back.\n\"We came under pressure, the wind was a big factor. We found a goal, that plus a formation change got us in the game. There were incredible swings in the game which is quite rare. We ended really strongly.\n\"Tactically we weren't where we needed to be. Chris [Mepham, substituted for Ryan Fraser after 23 minutes] unfortunately was sacrificed for the team. We were much better for the change.\n\"For passages, our counter-attacking was very strong. I felt we could win the game. Callum [Wilson] had a big chance to win the game. He's got two goals and performed well but that was a big moment.\n\"It's been a tough season for Southampton but they've responded well to their new manager and they're tough to play against.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton play at West Ham on Saturday 4 May and face already-relegated Huddersfield at home in their last match of the season on Sunday 12 May.\nBournemouth, who are 13th in the table, play their last home match against Tottenham on Saturday, before an away game at Crystal Palace on the final day."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-0 Everton: Toffees held to goalless draw\nEverton lost ground in the race for seventh place in the Premier League as they were held to a goalless draw by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.\nSubstitute Cenk Tosun's brilliant back-heeled effort was saved by Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita in the closing stages, while winger Bernard and left-back Lucas Digne also hit the post for Everton in the second half.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin missed opportunities to put them ahead in a lively first half, but was denied by Guaita from close range and failed to hit the target from Seamus Coleman's cross.\nPalace had chances too, as Max Meyer fired wide early on and James McArthur struck the side-netting during a positive spell for the Eagles after the interval.\nThe result lifted Marco Silva's Everton into eighth in the table, although they are now four points behind Wolves, who won 2-1 at Watford on Saturday.\nSeventh place could still offer a spot in next season's Europa League, should Manchester City beat Watford in the FA Cup final on 18 May.\nPalace, who secured their Premier League survival with victory over Arsenal on Sunday, remain 12th.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nMissed chances cost Everton\nA 4-0 demolition of Manchester United last weekend - Everton's fourth win in the past five games - hauled them back into contention for a seventh-place finish.\nThey began with an intensity reminiscent of their Goodison Park display last Sunday, but lacked a cutting edge as they failed to score despite registering 22 shots, only three of which found the target.\nCalvert-Lewin could perhaps have done better from Coleman and Richarlison's inviting crosses, but the 22-year-old showed plenty of promise with his energy and runs in behind the Palace back-line.\nEverton, who have now kept seven clean sheets in their past nine league games, looked solid once again, with Kurt Zouma bullying the Palace forwards off the ball on several occasions as his central defensive partnership with Michael Keane continues to develop.\nEverton face Burnley and Tottenham in their final two games of the season and will hope Fulham and title-chasing Liverpool can play their part in dislodging Wolves from seventh.\nSilva has said he is confident\n, external\nthe club will back him in the summer transfer window, and Everton's recent showings will have increased confidence among fans that he can take them forward next season.\n\"No doubt we were the best team on the pitch. We deserved the three points. From the first minute, we tried everything,\" said the Everton manager.\n\"We had chances to score but we have to be more clinical. It's something we keeping working to achieve. The most important thing is that we did everything. The connections between the players are coming more easily.\"\nPalace maintain fight despite safety\nManager Roy Hodgson said he did not fear complacency setting in among his Palace players after they achieved their earliest confirmation of Premier League safety.\nThey were forced to withstand periods of intense pressure from Everton, but stuck to their task and retained a desire to close down their opponents quickly.\nPalace's home form in 2018-19 will certainly be a concern for Hodgson - only bottom side Huddersfield have taken fewer points and failed to score more often.\nDespite being on the back foot for much of the first half, the hosts dominated immediately after the interval.\nMcArthur did well to control with his chest before unleashing a shot which went narrowly wide, although Palace failed to register a shot on target the whole match.\nWhile Everton kept forwards Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke quiet, Patrick van Aanholt - reintroduced as Hodgson's only change to the Palace line-up - was heavily involved at both ends of the pitch and produced an excellent tackle as Richarlison threatened to race clear into the penalty area.\n\"I'm pleased to get a point. I must give the players a lot of credit for sticking at their task and showing character,\" said Hodgson.\n\"I'm a little disappointed that today, after the euphoria of last week's result, we didn't come here and put on a splendid show. But football gives you those type of games. It wasn't for lack of trying.\"\nMan of the match - Idrissa Gueye (Everton)\nPalace's winless run against Everton - the stats\nCrystal Palace have not beaten Everton in the past nine Premier League meetings, dating back to a 3-2 win in September 2014.\nEverton have kept seven clean sheets in their past nine league games, one more than in their first 27 games this season.\nThis was the eighth time Palace have failed to score in a home league game this season - only Huddersfield, with nine, have failed to do so more often.\nEverton have won only two of their past 20 away league games in London, losing 10.\nEverton had 22 shots in this match - their most in an away league game since May 2017 at Arsenal.\nThis was Palace's fourth goalless league draw of the season - no side has done so more often.\nWhat's next?\nEverton host Burnley on Friday (20:00 BST), while Palace travel to relegation-threatened Cardiff on Saturday (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Newcastle United: Chris Hughton rues Glenn Murray miss\nChris Hughton thought struggling Brighton had secured their Premier League status but Glenn Murray's late miss against Newcastle means his side must wait at least another week to find out their fate.\nHaving fought their way back into the match when Pascal Gross headed in to cancel out Ayoze Perez's opener, the Seagulls striker looked odds-on to snatch the winner with minutes remaining. However, Murray headed over from no more than four yards out.\nWith two games of the season left, the Seagulls are 17th, a place and four points ahead of Cardiff with a daunting trip to Arsenal next Sunday. The Bluebirds, who lost to Fulham earlier and have an inferior goal difference, will be relegated if they lose to Crystal Palace a day earlier.\n\"When Murray had that opportunity at the end, I thought we'd done it,\" said Brighton boss Hughton.\n\"We hope that [Gross'] goal has made a big difference, but we can't afford to think that way. We have to think Cardiff are capable of winning their last two games and we must go to Arsenal thinking we have to get something.\"\nWill Murray's miss prove crucial?\nHughton had a look of despair on the touchline after Murray's last-gasp miss, but it is debatable whether his side would have deserved to take all three points.\nOnce again they were devoid of invention in attack and broke a club record of 11 hours and 13 minutes without a goal, which had stood since 1970.\nAt the other end, Hughton's defence struggled in the first half against attacking duo Perez and Salomon Rondon, who combined again for Newcastle's opener.\nPaul Dummett delivered the ball into the area for the Venezuelan target man, whose chested knock-down was lashed home by Spaniard Perez.\nThe introduction of Solly March in the second half improved Brighton as an attacking force, although their equaliser came from another familiar forward combination of Gross and Murray. On this occasion, Bruno's ball from the wing was headed into the path of the German, who nodded past Martin Dubravka from close range.\nWith confidence rediscovered, Brighton went searching for a winner and thought they had it when Barrow-born Murray met Anthony Knockaert's delivery - however he sent his effort over the bar.\nHow crucial a miss that might prove to be will be known in the coming weeks.\nIn-form Magpies in cruise control\nHow Hughton would love to be in Rafael Benitez's position. Both managers have spent relatively modest sums in transfer windows, but the Spaniard appears to have got the better out of what has been at his disposal this season.\nFor a second successive season Benitez's defence and attack have peaked in the second half of the campaign having been as low as 18th back in January.\nRondon and Perez have been key to this revival and have now combined for seven Premier League goals this season - the most by a Newcastle duo in one season since 1999-2000 when Alan Shearer and Nolberto Solano managed it eight times.\nAnd bar the Seagulls' two second-half chances, the Magpies' defence - currently the seventh tightest in the league - looked untroubled and compact.\nIt all bodes well for next season, that is if Newcastle can hold on to their manager.\nMan of the match - Pascal Gross (Brighton)\n'We needed to keep the ball better' - the reaction\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez:\n\"We had the control, we created the chances to score and we expected in the second half they'd be pushing.\n\"They were aggressive and they were fighting to avoid relegation, we needed to keep the ball better and our counter attacks were not good.\n\"We couldn't do the same as the first half and were not as comfortable on the ball. They were desperate to win so we need to understand the context of the game.\"\nPerez on fire - the stats\nBrighton have won just two of their past 16 Premier League matches (W2 D4 L10), and are winless in their last seven. Brighton ended a run of 735 minutes without a goal in all competitions courtesy of Pascal Gross' strike.\nNewcastle have won four points from their last two Premier League away games (W1 D1), one more than they had mustered in their previous eight combined (W0 D3 L5).\nOnly Huddersfield (14) have conceded more headed goals in the Premier League this season than Newcastle (13).\nPerez has scored seven goals in his past seven Premier League games, as many as he had in his previous 33 in the competition.\nRondon has been directly involved in 44% of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season (16/36); only Chelsea's Eden Hazard (49%) has recorded a higher share for his side in 2018-19. Indeed, it is the highest such percentage for Newcastle in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2003-04 (50% - 26/52).\nMurray provided his first Premier League assist for Brighton and his first since April 2015 for Crystal Palace versus Sunderland, ending a run of 97 appearances without one.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton are at Arsenal next Sunday (16:30 BST) and Newcastle are home to Liverpool next Saturday in what could be a crucial title-decider (19:45)."

It was safety and conservatism over risk-taking and ambition.\nFatigue, given their Europa League run - they play the first leg of the semi-final against Valencia on Thursday - was perhaps a prohibitive factor in this instance, but the trend for the season has already been established.\nCan Leicester hold on to Tielemans?\n\"Sign him up, sign him up, sign him up,\" sang the Leicester fans with added gusto after Tielemans scored and again at the full-time whistle.\nThe 21-year-old Belgium international oozed class with a mature midfield display, capped by a powerful header.\nTielemans has been directly involved in seven goals in his past nine league games, with three goals and four assists.\nHe joined Leicester on loan from Monaco in January until the end of the season.\nRodgers will surely be eager to sign the talented youngster, although more eye-catching performances mean he is not going to be short of suitors.\nMan of the match - James Maddison (Leicester)\n'Red card changed the game' - what they said\nArsenal boss Unai Emery said: \"Today the condition [for losing] is the red card.\n\"We worked, we prepared our game plan, 11 v 11 the match was going like we prepared.\n\"For me the first yellow card for [Maitland-Niles] is not for me, it has affected our game plan a lot. One player less is difficult.\n\"We will continue, we will not look at the table, the Europa League is a big motivation for us to win it.\"\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers said: \"Firstly our defence was nice and aggressive and we pressed the game really well.\n\"When it was 11 v 11 I thought we were the better team.\n\"There were areas we could be better in but the energy, pressing, quailty and three outstanding goals.\n\"I'm very pleased we got our reward for our hard work.\"\nRodgers revival continues - the stats\nOnly Liverpool and Manchester City have earned more Premier League points than the 16 Leicester have won since Brendan Rodgers took charge in March.\nLeicester won back-to-back home league games against Arsenal for the first time since November 1983.\nArsenal have lost three consecutive league games, conceding at least three goals in each for the first time since 1966.\nArsenal have lost four of their past five league games, as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 29.\nOnly Manchester United (6) have been shown more red cards than Arsenal (5) among Premier League sides in all competitions this season.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host relegation strugglers Brighton next Sunday (16:30 BST), while Leicester travel to Manchester City on Monday, 6 May (20:00)."

It was duly secured with a 12th successive league win.\nBurnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton also saved from Aguero, Aymeric Laporte and Bernardo Silva in a City performance that was average for long spells - but the main priority of three points was achieved and they know victory at home to Leicester City and away at Brighton will ensure they keep the crown.\nCity scrap it out again\nCity have been put to the test since their Champions League quarter-final exit against Tottenham - and they have responded in the manner of champions with three wins without conceding a goal.\nAnd in Premier League victories at home to Spurs and here at Burnley, with a routine derby win at Manchester United sandwiched in between, they have had to show a different side of their character, one not associated with the flowing football which has become their trademark.\nCity were so sloppy in spells, with passes going astray and moves breaking down after moments of carelessness, that there must have been genuine anxiety at half-time that they would be the first to blink in this magnificent tit-for-tat title battle with Liverpool.\nIn the end it was Aguero, predictably, who made the decisive contribution, as he became only the second player in Premier League history to score 20 or more goals in five consecutive campaigns, after Thierry Henry between 2001-02 and 2005-06.\nThe goal, like City's display, was not a thing of beauty but City's players and their fans did not care as they celebrated another vital step forward on the road to the title at the end.\nClarets show their grit\nBurnley's supporters rose to acclaim their team at the final whistle despite defeat - another season of Premier League safety assured by manager Sean Dyche and his players.\nDyche kept his nerve when Burnley dropped into the Premier League's bottom three after a 5-1 home defeat by Everton on Boxing Day, which left them with just 12 points from 19 games.\nTom Heaton replaced Joe Hart in goal and all the traditional Burnley qualities of organisation and determination have made sure they will be in the top flight again next term.\nThe problem the Clarets had here was that, despite all the sweat they expended and how expertly they were set up in defence by Dyche, they just did not have that extra touch of class in attack to lay a glove on the reigning champions.\nBurnley recorded only two shots on target, their lowest in a Premier League game, and it was endeavour rather than inspiration that made it an anxious closing phase for City.\nDyche and Burnley, however, deserve huge credit for how they pulled their season around after it threatened to plunge into crisis around the Christmas period.\nMan of the match - Bernardo Silva (Man City)\n'We had a real go' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"I thought we had a real go and that is pleasing from a mentality point of view. We took the game on and we are not going to beat them at their game so we had to make it as awkward. We did that well.\n\"We came close to getting something but they have got some great players. I heard Pep Guardiola screaming 'get it in the corner' to his players.\n\"Even the best sides. They have to do it. Sometimes they have to do it as well and today was one of those times. I thought it was refreshing to hear a top manager scream to his players get it in the corner.\"\nManchester City striker Sergio Aguero: \"I am so very happy for the win and now we have one week now to prepare for the next game.\n\"I am very happy with the goal because the first half we had chances. I was happy for the technology - I thought it was over the line!\n\"When I scored I enjoyed the moment with my team-mates.\"\nDazzling dozen for City - the stats\nSince Manchester City lost 2-1 away at Newcastle in January, they have won each of their past 12 Premier League games, scoring 27 goals and conceding just three.\nThis is only the second season in English top-flight history where two sides have earned 90+ points, after Arsenal (94) and Leeds (91) in the 1970-71 campaign (adjusted to three points for a win).\nBurnley are winless in their last eight meetings with Man City in all competitions (D1 L7) since a 1-0 win in March 2015.\nBurnley recorded only two shots against Manchester City, the fewest they have ever attempted in a single Premier League match.\nOnly against Jose Mourinho (seven) has Burnley manager Sean Dyche faced an opposition manager more often in the Premier League without winning than against Pep Guardiola (six).\nMan City striker Sergio Aguero has scored nine goals in his last eight meetings with Burnley in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City host Leicester, managed by former Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, on Monday, 6 May in a match which kicks off at 20:00 BST while Burnley face Everton at Goodison Park on Friday, 3 May (20:00 BST)."

The Argentine has not made a Premier League appearance since 13 May 2018 when he kept a clean sheet in a 1-0 win against Watford.\nIt remains to be seen whether he will be called into action before the end of the season in two weeks' time.\nWho will finish in the top four?\nWith Tottenham losing at home to West Ham on Saturday and Arsenal losing heavily at Leicester earlier on Sunday, this result means none of the teams placed between third and sixth won over the weekend.\nFive points separate Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United with 180 minutes of the Premier League season remaining.\n\"Points are being dropped left, right and centre in this race,\" said Solskjaer.\n\"If you look at the league table it's going to be difficult for us. We've got to make sure we turn up, win the next two games, play well and you never know.\"\nFor United, they will hope the teams above them keep dropping points as they look to avoid missing out on a top-four spot for the third time in four seasons.\nIt is not too long ago that fixtures between Manchester United and Chelsea went a long way to deciding who won the Premier League and, in 2008, the Champions League.\nUnited, who now trail leaders Manchester City by 27 points, started well - a delicious punt forward by Luke Shaw setting up Romelu Lukaku, although the Belgian remains without a top-flight goal since 2 March after Kepa Arrizabalaga saved.\nLukaku, however, was involved in his side's goal, his pass over the top of the Chelsea defence allowing Shaw to hook it back for Mata to score on his 31st birthday.\nBailly went close to doubling the lead from a corner before De Gea's mistake let Chelsea back into the game.\nChances were in short supply after the interval, although substitute Marcos Rojo had a header cleared off the line by Pedro.\nChelsea dig in to earn crucial point\nLike United, Chelsea are also without a win in their last three league games but the Blues will be the happier of the two teams despite De Gea's late save to deny Higuain.\nVictory would have sent them level on points with third-placed Tottenham but they remain well positioned to finish in a Champions League spot.\n\"We need two wins. With this we are sure,\" said Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri.\n\"We are fighting for the top four and in semi-final of the Europa League. We have done a good season. Now we need to take two very important targets.\"\nThis was an improvement for Sarri's men after they were held at home by Burnley and showed that they do have an appetite for a fight.\nEden Hazard was again a creative force while Alonso showed great awareness to equalise after De Gea's gift.\nBoth teams struggled to create chances during a tense second half and the injury to Rudiger will be a concern to Sarri.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nUnited's longest winless run since 2015 - the stats\nManchester United have not won any of their last four games in all competitions - they have not had a longer winless run since December 2015.\nUnited attempted just seven shots against Chelsea - since 2003-04, they've only had fewer in a Premier League game at Old Trafford on four previous occasions.\nSince his Premier League debut for Chelsea in September 2016, Marcus Alonso has scored more goals than any other defender in the competition (15).\nUnited have kept a clean sheet in just 11% of their league games at Old Trafford this season (2/18), their lowest percentage in a single campaign since 1962-63.\nJuan Mata became the second player to score for both clubs in Premier League meetings between Chelsea and Man Utd, after Mark Hughes\nWhat's next?\nManchester United's penultimate game of the season is at relegated Huddersfield Town next Sunday (14:00 BST) while Chelsea now turn their thoughts to Thursday's Europa League semi-final first leg tie with Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany (20:00)."

They can qualify for Europe, but it remains a long shot.\nThey need to finish seventh, which means they cannot afford Wolves to win either of their final games. And they also need Manchester City to beat Watford in the FA Cup final to ensure the seventh-placed team get a Europa League place.\nEverton blew Burnley away with a quick start at Goodison Park.\nThey had five shots in the opening 10 minutes and 12 efforts in the first half.\nRicharlison had an effort blocked and fired another over before his shot helped give them the lead. Gylfi Sigurdsson picked out the Brazilian and his long-range strike flew past Heaton - but it was registered as a Mee own goal as the shot took a deflection off the Burnley defender.\nEverton continued their push for goals and Digne's effort from outside the box was saved with Coleman stooping in to head in his 20th Premier League goal.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin had several chances for Everton but failed to test Heaton.\nThe Toffees lost Richarlison to a not-too-serious-looking injury early in the second half. Their chances dried up after the break - until a wonderful Ademola Lookman shot from outside the box late on which clipped the top of the crossbar.\nBBC Sport's European qualification explainer\n\"The players have been doing well,\" said Silva. \"The last 10 games we have had eight clean sheets and have been playing offensive football. The players have been enjoying what they are doing and we have achieved three points again.\n\"We were always in control. We deserved those two goals in that moment. I didn't really like the second half. We were in control but gave some chances to them. We could do better.\"\nBurnley getting ready for their holidays\nThe visitors worked hard but looked, understandably, like a team whose season is over.\nBurnley practically guaranteed their survival last month with three consecutive wins and a draw against Chelsea. A top-half finish is out of the question so Dyche's team have no real aim in the final couple of games.\nThe manager said after the game that his players are \"human beings\", adding: \"We've climbed a mountain in the second half of the season. We're safe, with not too much to play for.\n\"I won't over-question the players after what they've done recently but we didn't do enough to win the game. To us 1% is a big difference - we need all our players to be 100%.\"\nThey managed only five shots - including a decent Johann Gudmundsson volley over the bar - while Chris Wood had their only effort on target, with a scuffed finish that Jordan Pickford easily saved.\nAshley Barnes did put a brilliant volley from Robbie Brady's cross into the back of the net - but it was rightly ruled out for offside.\nThey should have had a penalty when ex-Clarets defender Keane pushed Vydra, but a comeback rarely looked on the cards.\nMan of the match - Lucas Digne (Everton)\nMatch stats - Burnley's May struggles\nEverton have kept five consecutive clean sheets at Goodison Park in the Premier League for the first time since September 2013 (a run of seven).\nBurnley earned 17 points away from home this season, 11 fewer than they managed in 2017-18, despite scoring a goal more.\nEverton have kept nine clean sheets on home soil in the Premier League this season. Only Liverpool (11) have kept more.\nBurnley have lost each of their last five Premier League games in the month of May, shipping 13 goals in total.\nBurnley have had just one shot on target in their last 203 minutes of league action.\nBurnley defender Ben Mee accounts for four of the Clarets' 11 Premier League own goals, no other player has scored more than once in this manner.\nSeamus Coleman is the 20th player to score 20 Premier League goals for Everton, and the third defender to do so for the club after David Unsworth (33) and Leighton Baines (29).\nWhat's next?\nEverton go to Tottenham Hotspur and Burnley host Arsenal on the final day next Sunday (all games at 15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-0 Tottenham: Nine-man Spurs fail to secure top-four spot\nTottenham had two players sent off as they missed the chance to guarantee Champions League football next season after Nathan Ake scored an injury-time winner for Bournemouth.\nIt was far from ideal preparation for Mauricio Pochettino's side, who face Ajax in the Champions League semi-final second leg on Wednesday in Amsterdam, having lost the first leg 1-0.\nSon Heung-min was dismissed for pushing Jefferson Lerma at the end of a frantic first half, in which Eric Dier was lucky not to have been sent off and Bournemouth could conceivably have had two penalties.\nThen, just over two minutes after coming on at half-time, Juan Foyth was also shown a straight red card as he slid studs-up into Jack Simpson.\nSpurs have now won just once in their past four league games and stay third on 70 points, four points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who have two games remaining.\nChampions League qualification is still in Tottenham's hands, and they need to beat Everton in their final league game on 12 May to make sure of a top-four spot.\nRelive the action from Vitality Stadium\n\"It is very painful to play with two players less than the opponent,\" Pochettino said.\n\"We need to move on. We cannot change the decisions. We have ahead two finals against Ajax and Everton. It is in our hands. If it does not happen we will be proud because nobody expected Tottenham to be in the position they are today.\n\"We are fighting six teams, it is impossible for all six to get the top four, whatever happens I will feel proud and whatever happens in the semi-final I will be proud.\"\nBournemouth gave a senior debut to 19-year-old Irish goalkeeper Mark Travers and he made five saves in the first half to keep Spurs at bay, but was a spectator in the second half.\nDespite their numerical advantage, the Cherries were unable to capitalise until Ake popped up to score in the 91st minute, heading in from a Ryan Fraser corner.\nWho will qualify for Europe?\nSpurs see red\nHow Pochettino would have wanted a straightforward win and the chance to rest players with the biggest game of his managerial career looming on Wednesday.\nBut his side made things far from easy and were the creators of their own downfall.\nDier was the first into Craig Pawson's book as early as the 11th minute, with a bad tackle on Fraser and he could easily have received a second booking with a mistimed lunge on Joshua King as he stopped a Bournemouth counter-attack.\nHugo Lloris could have conceded a penalty when he collided with King, as the Norwegian tried to poke the ball past him.\nAnd the Cherries had another penalty shout when Dier booted the back of Callum Wilson's ankle as he went to shoot.\nSon's uncharacteristic red card came in the 43rd minute as he let his frustration boil over after he was pulled up for a foul on Fraser and he shoved Lerma, who dramatically fell to the ground.\nSpurs had been on top in the first half, testing debutant Travers on a number of occasions and, while Son's sending-off made things hard, Foyth's senseless challenge made it almost impossible.\nThe Argentine came on for Toby Alderweireld, but he had just three touches in two minutes and 13 seconds before he caught Simpson.\nThey failed to register a shot on target in the second half and as Bournemouth ratcheted up the pressure, Ake's goal was a matter of when, not if.\nPochettino will have to somehow pick his tired players up for the Ajax game, against a team who have already eliminated Real Madrid and Juventus.\nBut they go into that game in some of their worst form of the season, having suffered three consecutive defeats and five in their past six games in all competitions.\nTravers impresses on debut\nAll the pre-match talk had been about Travers' debut two weeks before his 20th birthday, with the youngster chosen ahead of 31-year-old Asmir Begovic who was not in the squad and 39-year-old Artur Boruc who sat on the bench.\nHe is the youngest Premier League goalkeeper to make his debut since Joe Hart in 2006, and his last first-team game came on loan for Weymouth at Gosport on New Year's Day 2018 - having begun that spell by scoring from his own half with a free-kick.\nThis was a strong debut - he was happy to leave his area and was confident on the ball.\nHis eagerness to stray out of his box almost saw him concede a goal from the half-way line when Lucas Moura took aim in the eighth minute from 35 yards, but sent his shot wide.\nBut then came a string of fine saves - he acrobatically tipped efforts from Moura and Dele Alli over the bar and saved a one-one-one against Moura with his feet.\n\"It's always a gamble to start someone who's never played but on what we've seen I think he deserved an opportunity,\" said Cherries boss Eddie Howe. \"You couldn't write a better debut. He's a great guy.\"\nAt the other end of the pitch, Bournemouth used their pace well against Spurs, forcing them to concede free-kicks as Dier, Alderweireld and Moussa Sissoko were all booked as they struggled against the counter-attack.\nBut after Foyth's sending off they barely threatened until a final five-minute barrage that got them their goal.\nAlthough safe in mid-table, it was a much-needed win for Eddie Howe's side who won their first home game in six and now have a slightly better record of three wins in their last 13 matches.\nTheir Premier League record points total to date is 46 in 2016-17 and they can surpass that tally if they beat Crystal Palace next week.\n\"It was huge for us to win after we went a long time without winning at home,\" added Howe. \"It has tailed off the last few weeks and we were very keen to end on high note.\"\nMan of the match - Mark Travers\nSpurs away day blues - The best stats\nAke has scored two of Bournemouth's five 90th-minute winning goals in the Premier League, also doing so against Liverpool in December 2016.\nTottenham have lost six consecutive away Premier League matches for the first time since May 2004 under David Pleat.\nFraser has registered 14 Premier League assists this season - no player has more in the top five European leagues (also Jadon Sancho on 14).\nFoyth was sent off 133 seconds after coming on as a substitute for Spurs - the fastest red card for a sub in a Premier League game since Steven Gerrard was red-carded after 38 seconds in March 2015 for Liverpool against Manchester United.\nTravers (aged 19 years and 351 days) became the first teenage goalkeeper to start a Premier League game since Joe Hart for Manchester City in October 2006.\nSon is the fifth Asian player to receive a Premier League red card, after Sun Jihai, Li Tie, Hidetoshi Nakata and Maya Yoshida.\nSpurs became the first team to receive two red cards in a Premier League game since Chelsea against Burnley in August 2017, and the first to receive two straight red cards since Manchester City against Chelsea in December 2016.\nSince the start of the 2015-16 season, teams facing Bournemouth have received 18 red cards - five more than any other club has seen an opponent red carded in that time.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Crystal Palace for their final game of the season on 12 May (15:00 BST).\nSpurs face Ajax on Wednesday (20:00) as they battle for a place in the Champions League final, before their final Premier League match against Everton on 12 May (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Wolves 1-0 Fulham: Hosts close in on seventh-placed finish through Leander Dendoncker's winner\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo says it would be \"stupid\" to think about European football despite his side moving a step closer to a seventh-placed Premier League finish and potentially a Europa League spot next season with victory over Fulham.\nAfter a largely frustrating 75 minutes for the hosts at Molineux, Joao Moutinho played in Matt Doherty down the right for the defender to curl in a fine cross that Leander Dendoncker emphatically volleyed inside the near post.\nWolves will be guaranteed to finish seventh in their first season after promotion if Leicester fail to beat Premier League leaders Manchester City on Monday.\nIf Nuno's side do secure seventh and City subsequently beat Watford in the FA Cup final, then Wolves will land a Europa League place, returning to Europe after a 39-year wait.\n\"The FA Cup still has to be played, it would be stupid to think about Europe,\" said Nuno.\n\"It's nothing to do with the table, it's the how - the how is much more important.\n\"It started two years ago and we will never forget where we came from.\"\nSuperb Wolves forward Diogo Jota went close four times, twice sliding wide and twice drawing fine saves from Fulham keeper Sergio Rico, while Dendoncker also hit the bar with a header.\nThe already-relegated visitors should have taken the lead on 62 minutes but Aleksandar Mitrovic scooped his first-time effort over the bar after he was picked out in the middle by Ryan Sessegnon.\nFulham midfielder Harvey Elliott became the youngest ever Premier League player at 16 years and 30 days by coming on in the 88th minute.\nRelive Wolves' win over Fulham\nReaction to victories for Wolves and West Ham\nDendoncker ensures rousing end to home finale\nWolves have oddly had problems against struggling sides this season, having lost six of their 11 previous matches against teams in the bottom six heading into that round of fixtures.\nFor long periods of this game, it looked like a compact but limited Fulham would add a goalless draw to that record but Wolves were determined not to let their last home game be a disappointment after a season of thrilling matches at Molinuex.\nJota weaved his way past Fulham defenders all afternoon, picking up a yellow card for simulation early on, but more often drawing fouls and getting his team surging forward on the counter-attack.\nIn the first half, a brilliant flick from Raul Jimenez led to Jota forcing Rico to palm it round corner, before he got past his man and slid wide across goal with his left foot.\nHe similarly slipped a left-footed effort beyond the far post after the break and then saw a brilliant volley pushed onto the bar by Rico as the Portuguese ultimately failed to get the goal his performance deserved.\nDoherty then lashed a superb strike high into the net but was rightly called offside when Jonny's initial shot was deflected into his path.\nBut Dendoncker finally broke through. Having seen his header from a corner rebound off the bar in the first half, the Belgium midfielder showed excellent technique to volley the ball from just behind his body and edge Wolves towards the highest finish for a promoted side since Ipswich came fifth in 2000-01.\nChampions League and Europa League: Who will qualify in various scenarios?\nFulham look to the future\nDefeat ended a run of three successive victories for Fulham after their relegation was confirmed last month but there were again some promising signs from caretaker boss Scott Parker's side.\nThey were comfortable in possession, albeit rarely incisive around Wolves' area, their defenders made some fine covering tackles and Rico impressed in goal, also denying Doherty's header at the near post and pushing away Ruben Neves' 25-yard drive.\nThe visitors could even have had a club record fourth Premier League win in a row had Mitrovic not miscued his strike when free in the area after fine work from Sessegnon down the right, while Joe Bryan also drew a decent save from Rui Patricio.\nUltimately this match just reinforced the gap between these two promoted sides, with Wolves plotting how they might even break into the top six and Fulham facing another tough task to return straight away from the Championship.\nAnd the Cottagers offered a brief nod to that future, bringing on Elliott, who beat the previous Premier League mark of former Fulham defender Matthew Briggs.\nBriggs was 16 years and 68 days when he played against Middlesbrough in May 2007.\nMan of the match - Diogo Jota (Wolves)\n'An important win' - reaction\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Sport: \"This is an important win, it was important to the atmosphere at Molineux. Everyone expected us to win but it was difficult because we faced a tough team.\n\"But I'm really pleased with the way we finished the season at home, the fans have been fantastic this season.\n\"We had to be focused, organised and disciplined because Fulham had chances also, it was a tight game.\"\nFulham caretaker manager Scott Parker told BBC Sport: \"We are a bit disappointed. We knew the task ahead of us. We had a game plan that we worked hard on this week. We wanted to take the sting out of Wolves.\n\"It's a tough place to come here but I felt we dominated the ball today and for us that's the best way to defend. We have conceded one goal in four now and that's down to the players.\n\"Our main aim now is next year and the task ahead, it's a big task and we know what we want to do.\"\nFulham's troubles on the road - stats\nWolves have won 57 points in the Premier League this season, the most by a newly promoted side since Ipswich Town in 2000-01 (66 points).\nFulham have lost 25 Premier League games this season, the most by a newly promoted side since Derby County in 2007-08 (29 defeats).\nNo player has more assists for Wolves in all competitions this season than Matt Doherty (eight).\nThis was Fulham's 16th away Premier League defeat of the season - only Burnley in 2009-10 have lost more in a single season (17).\nWolves named their 14th unchanged Premier League starting XI this season - no side has done so more often (also Burnley on 14).\nWhat's next?\nWolves are away at Liverpool on the final day of the season on Sunday, 12 May, while Fulham host Newcastle, with both matches at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "West Ham 3-0 Southampton: Arnautovic double seals win over Saints\nManager Manuel Pellegrini hailed West Ham's \"special season\" as their bid for a top-10 finish was enhanced with a comfortable victory over Southampton.\nMarko Arnautovic scored twice - his first goals since January - with Ryan Fredericks adding a third with his first Premier League goal.\nIt moves West Ham to within a point of the top half of the table - something that looked like a big ask after they lost their first four games of the season and stood on just eight points after their opening 10 league matches.\n\"It's a special season because we started so badly,\" Pellegrini told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"We knew it wouldn't be easy but we had so many players with injuries - a lot of players that couldn't play but maybe they will give us the plus we need to improve for next season.\n\"For me it's a good season, a consistent season, we are not fighting relegation, but not only in the table but in the stadium too I think a lot of people are happy.\"\nRe-live West Ham's win over Southampton\nArnautovic had given the hosts the lead early in the first half but Southampton had keeper Fraser Forster - making his first appearance since December 2017 - to thank as he thwarted several more Hammers chances.\nThe Austria striker doubled his and his side's tally after the break with a simple header from close range, before Ryan Fredericks scored his first Premier League goal just three minutes later.\nIn a game of very different halves, Southampton - quiet in the first period - came out of the break in a higher gear. However, the two quick-fire Hammers goals, which came against the run of play, took the wind out of their sails.\n\"The last, very hard four or five months has cost us a lot of energy for this team and we didn't have enough energy to fight back after a horrible mistake in the first half,\" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told Sky Sports.\n\"We tried but the team has invested a lot in trying to stay in the league and the power was a little bit gone. We had a few good chances but it was [the case that] the last good decision in front of goal, the power to score wasn't here - I think the concentration wasn't 100%.\n\"If you come here in a tough game after investing a lot in the last weeks and concede the first goal it takes a lot of energy to fight back. We didn't have that today.\"\nHammers defy Southampton fightback\nManuel Pellegrini's side looked to be cruising to the win in the first half, with Grady Diangana among the West Ham players having early efforts on Forster's goal.\nIt was Arnautovic - who looked set to leave West Ham for China in January - who broke the deadlock in the 16th minute, latching on to a pass from Mark Noble and giving his side the advantage with a clinical finish.\nArthur Masuaku caused havoc on the left wing as he, Arnautovic and Michail Antonio tried to double their lead but Forster, no doubt eager to impress his manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, proved strong between the Southampton posts.\nIt was a different story in the second half though, as West Ham struggled to deal with a revitalised Southampton boosted by the half-time introduction of Nathan Redmond.\nNoble superbly stopped Stuart Armstrong in his tracks as he powered towards goal, the West Ham captain's tackle perfectly timed on the edge of the box.\nBut Arnautovic soon doubled West Ham's lead, heading in from almost a goal-line position after Forster could only punch a Masuaku cross right into him.\nJust minutes later, the three points were all but secured for the hosts, Fredericks blasting the ball in after a neat one-two with substitute Jack Wilshere.\nSaints regret missed chances despite inspired Redmond introduction\nSouthampton are already assured of Premier League status next season but they will rue missed opportunities to take at least a point at London Stadium.\nThey struggled to contain the Hammers in the first half but Hasenhuttl's half-time team-talk, and decision to bring on Redmond, did the trick as the dominance quickly switched.\nRedmond proved a nuisance to the hosts, going close within seconds of the restart before a volley just five minutes later was deflected out of play.\nMohamed Elyounoussi also had chances to bring his side back into the game, cleverly switching the ball from his left foot to his right before following up with a poor shot. Redmond then went close yet again with a terrific volley that Lukasz Fabianski could only tip over the bar.\nTheir momentum was stopped however by West Ham's second-half double and finding three goals in the final 18 minutes to earn a point was never a realistic proposition.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic (West Ham)\nHammers do the double - the stats\nWest Ham secured a Premier League double over Southampton for the first time since the 2000-01 campaign.\nSouthampton lost by a three-goal margin to West Ham in the Premier League for only the fourth time in 34 meetings (also May 2001, October 2012 and March 2018).\nWest Ham have won 31 points on home soil this season; their highest total in a single season at London Stadium. They last won more at home in their final season at Upton Park (34 in 2015-16).\nWest Ham's Marko Arnautovic has scored four goals in two Premier League games against Southampton at London Stadium. Indeed, Arnautovic has bagged more Premier League goals vs Southampton than he has against any other team (5).\nSince the start of last season, Arnautovic has been directly involved in 30 Premier League goals (20 goals, 10 assists), 14 more than any other West Ham player.\nWest Ham midfielder Mark Noble has provided more Premier League assists in 2018-19 (5) than he has in any other season in the competition.\nWest Ham's Ryan Fredericks scored his first Premier League goal and his first in league competition since scoring in January 2014 for Millwall versus Ipswich in the Championship.\nSouthampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster made his first Premier League appearance for the club since Boxing Day 2017, that match 494 days earlier ending in a 5-2 defeat.\nWhat's next?\nJust one week remains of the 2018-19 Premier League season, and West Ham will bid it farewell away to Watford next Sunday (15:00 BST).\nAt the same time, Southampton welcome relegated Huddersfield to St. Mary's."

        "article_text": "Cardiff 2-3 Crystal Palace: Bluebirds relegated from Premier League after defeat\nCardiff City will make an instant return to the Championship after their Premier League relegation was confirmed with a home defeat against an impressive Crystal Palace.\nNeeding to win this game to keep intact their faint hopes of staying up, Cardiff hit the post inside the first minute through Josh Murphy but then fell behind when their former loanee Wilfried Zaha fired into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.\nThe Bluebirds equalised less than two minutes later as Martin Kelly turned a Leandro Bacuna cross into his own net, only for Palace to regain the lead as Michy Batshuayi applied an emphatic finish to a fluent passing move.\nCardiff rallied with a handful of second-half chances but Andros Townsend crushed any lingering hopes the hosts had of avoiding relegation when he cut inside from the right wing and struck with a low effort that went in off the post.\nCardiff City down but united by Warnock\nPlayers want Warnock to stay - Etheridge\nWarnock 'no idea' on Cardiff future\nBobby Reid scored in the 90th minute to reduce the Bluebirds' deficit but they were ultimately well beaten by a confident Palace side, who climbed up to 12th in the Premier League table.\nIn a quirky twist of fate, the Eagles' victory also secured top-flight survival for their bitter rivals Brighton.\nCardiff, meanwhile, are left to reflect on their second successive Premier League stint the that has ended after a single season.\nCardiff down but not disheartened\nEven before kick-off, there was an air of resignation at the Cardiff City Stadium, where the home fans seemed to have reluctantly accepted their team's likely fate.\nWith Cardiff needing to beat Palace and then win at Manchester United on the final weekend - while also hoping Brighton lost to Arsenal and Manchester City - the prospect of survival was remote.\nThe mood was not as gloomy as it might have been, though. The common refrain among most Cardiff supporters was that they couldn't have asked for more effort from their side, who were written off at the start of the season and at least still had some sort of chance - however slim - of clawing their way to safety.\nHaving any kind of hope gave the players and fans reason to believe, and that was evident when Murphy's deflected 25-yard strike hit the post to prompt a huge roar of encouragement from the crowd.\nReality kicked in, however, when Zaha's low effort nestled in Cardiff's net; the home fans silenced as the severity of their side's predicament dawned on them.\nNeither the players nor fans meekly accepted their fate, though, and Kelly's own goal briefly renewed their hopes of a miraculous escape.\nBut although Warnock's men grafted as they always have done, they were simply not up to the standard of their slick opponents.\nCardiff looked heavy-legged and perplexed as Palace's attackers out-thought and outplayed them, and it was a small wonder that the hosts were not further than 2-1 behind at half-time.\nThat has been the story of their season: wholehearted in their commitment and endeavour but limited in terms of their ability, and vulnerable against genuine quality.\nDown but not disheartened, the vast majority of home fans stayed behind after the final whistle to pay tribute to their players and veteran manager, who they serenaded with loud cries of \"There's only one Neil Warnock\".\nPalace impress on the road again\nComfortable in mid-table and with little to play for, Palace may have seemed like ideal opposition for a Cardiff side fighting for survival - but Roy Hodgson's team had a formidable away record to maintain.\nThe Eagles had already collected 16 points on the road in 2019 - a total only bettered by Manchester City - and their counter-attacking here demonstrated why they have been such a force away from Selhurst Park.\nZaha and Townsend were both in irresistible form on the left and right wings, stretching Cardiff's defenders with their pace and movement, switching positions with Jordan Ayew and Batshuayi to devastating effect.\nThe first goal was an illustration of Zaha's individual trickery - with a subtle drop of the shoulder to deceive Aron Gunnarsson before firing in - while the second was a triumph of team play.\nZaha found Luka Milivojevic, who passed to Ayew, who then threaded the ball through Bruno Ecuele Manga's legs to Batshuayi, who blasted the ball into the top corner.\nAlthough Cardiff recovered and threatened to level for a second time, Palace reasserted their control with a fine third goal as Townsend sped down the right flank, cut inside and scored with a low left-footed strike.\nSome Palace fans had joked before this match that they would have liked to see their team lose in order to damage Brighton's chances of staying up - but the players did not get that memo.\nThis was an assured performance brimming with attacking promise that bodes well for next season.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\n'I have nothing but praise for everybody' - what they said\nCardiff boss Neil Warnock, speaking to BBC Sport: \"They [the fans] knew when I took over the club was in a mess. It's been reborn - everybody is singing from the same hymn sheet.\n\"They know we've given it our best. We had some great chances in the second half. The Chelsea result killed us, that night in the dressing room. It was really low that night. They have kept fighting so I have no complaints.\n\"The problems we have had to put up with throughout the season, I have nothing but praise for everybody. It makes such a difference when you hear the crowd.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We scored three good goals and created some good opportunities aside from that - their goalkeeper made some outstanding blocks.\n\"It's never easy coming to a team fighting for their lives once your own safety is secured. We showed some good quality.\"\nOn the difference between away form and home form: \"Away from home it's been different, we've taken our chances much better, scored some very good goals and we do find when we play away from home that the game opens up more. Teams have shown respect to us this year and don't leave many gaps.\n\"We still believe Selhurst Park is an excellent ground to have as a home ground and I hope next season we get as many home points as we manage to get away.\"\nCardiff straight back down again - the stats\nCardiff City have become the only team to play in more than one Premier League season and be relegated every time (also relegated in 2013-14).\nCrystal Palace have won 29 away Premier League points this season (W9 D2 L8) - only Man City, Liverpool and Spurs have won more.\nNeil Warnock has suffered his third top-flight relegation, going down with three different teams in three different decades - Notts County in 1991-92, Sheffield United in 2006-07 and Cardiff City in 2018-19.\nNine of Wilfried Zaha's 10 Premier League goals for Crystal Palace this season have been scored away from home. Among players to score 10+ goals in a season, it is the joint-highest percentage of away goals, along with Rod Wallace for Leeds United in 1997-98 (also nine out of 10).\nOnly Jamie Vardy (10) and Harry Kane (11) have scored more away Premier League goals this season than Zaha.\nMichy Batshuayi has ended on the winning side in all eight Premier League games in which he's found the net. Only Daniel Agger (nine) and Chris Smalling (11) have scored in more games with a 100% record.\nCardiff suffered 11 home league defeats this season, only losing more in two previous campaigns - 13 in 1984-85 and 12 in 1994-95.\nCrystal Palace defender Martin Kelly has scored both of their last two own-goals in the Premier League, scoring one today and against Chelsea in March 2018.\nWhat's next?\nCardiff travel to Manchester United and Crystal Palace host Bournemouth on the final day of the season next Sunday (both 15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle 2-3 Liverpool: Divock Origi's late winner ensures title race goes to last day\nDivock Origi's late winner sent Liverpool top of the Premier League with victory at Newcastle United to put the pressure back on Manchester City and ensure the title race will go to the final game.\nOrigi - on as substitute for Mohamed Salah after he was taken off on a stretcher with a head injury sustained in a collision with Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka - headed in Xherdan Shaqiri's free-kick in the 86th minute.\nIt gave Liverpool three points after a topsy-turvy night on Tyneside.\nNow Manchester City must beat Leicester City at Etihad Stadium on Monday to ensure they retain the initiative going into the final round of games next Sunday.\nLiverpool went ahead after 13 minutes when Virgil van Dijk arrived unmarked on the end of Trent Alexander-Arnold's free-kick.\nNewcastle were quickly level when Christian Atsu scored from close range after Alexander-Arnold handled Salomon Rondon's shot on the line but Salah took advantage of more poor marking to volley home another fine delivery from the young defender.\nRondon, a handful all night, drew Newcastle level once more nine minutes after the break when Liverpool failed to clear a corner and Jurgen Klopp's side suffered another blow when Salah was taken off after a lengthy delay.\nOrigi was introduced and made the decisive contribution that keeps the title race alive - although Salah's injury is a worry with Liverpool attempting to claw back a 3-0 deficit against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield on Tuesday.\n'Liverpool survive night laced with danger \u2013 and now look to Rodgers for helping hand'\nWe have qualified for our final - Klopp\nSalah could face Barca but Firmino out\nHow the title race could still go to a 39th game play-off\nLiverpool refuse to go away\nLiverpool simply refuse to buckle in their pursuit of Manchester City - no matter how long they have to wait to get the victories they require.\nKlopp's side are showing remarkable drive and resilience, illustrated by the manner in which they have won so many games in the closing stages, especially when the pressure has been on.\nThere have been prime examples at home to Everton and Tottenham but in recent weeks they have stayed the course to outlast opponents such as Fulham, Southampton and now Newcastle away from home.\nAnd here, in this unforgiving Tyneside atmosphere, they overcame adversity and a Newcastle side who were in no mood to stand meekly aside despite Premier League safety being assured.\nLiverpool were vulnerable in defence but this is a side that carries a persistent threat and it was the introduction of the likes of Shaqiri and Origi that made the difference.\nLiverpool could have been forgiven for thinking the fates were against them when Salah took that sickening blow in an accidental aerial collision with Dubravka, the Egyptian lying on the floor for several minutes before being taken away on a stretcher to sympathetic applause from the entire stadium.\nAnd yet they responded once more, digging deep to secure three points with Origi's glancing header and this means Manchester City know the stakes are huge when they face Brendan Rodgers' in-form side on Monday.\nWhat next for Newcastle and Benitez?\nRafael Benitez spent the entire night taking the acclaim of the Toon Army, from before kick-off to a post-match lap of honour when the supporters chanted long and loud for the Spaniard to agree a new deal to stay at St James' Park.\nThe messages are still mixed but not here among Newcastle's fanbase. There is only one outcome these fans, who idolise Benitez, want.\nWhether Benitez gives them what they desire remains to be seen but once again he has kept a workmanlike squad in the Premier League with room to spare and now wants the investment to send them into the top 10.\nIronically, on this night, some of the Benitez trademarks were missing as wretched defensive organisation allowed Liverpool to cash in on each of their goals.\nBut, as he led the players around St James' Park to take the supporters' applause it was clear that those fans now want the final line of this season's story to be written with Benitez's name on a new deal.\nWhen asked about his future, Benitez said: \"We have been talking the last week and hopefully in one or two weeks will have more news.\"\nMan of the match - Andrew Robertson (Liverpool)\nKlopp 'doesn't feel pressure' - reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I know what kind of boys I have - who doesn't know after the game today? If anyone thought Newcastle weren't playing for anything, wow, that was competitive - but we deserved to win.\n\"I only have to help the boys. I don't feel pressure. If we are champions then we are champions, you can't feel pressure when you do your best.\nOn Divock Origi's winning goal: \"That's nearly a fairytale. And now we are qualified for our final on Sunday against Wolves. Of course before that we play Barcelona but I'm not thinking of that yet and then we will see.\"\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I'm really proud because it was a difficult game against a very good team but the players gave everything. The fans appreciate that and were behind the team, we couldn't ask for more.\n\"We made a few mistakes at set pieces but in terms of effort and desire we did quite well. We are trying to make sure we don't make so many mistakes. I don't know about the third goal but the first two we can do much better.\n\"We have been quite consistent, working really hard as a team and as a unit, staying very compact. It was a great performance from us.\"\nLiverpool love headers and subs - stats\nLiverpool have scored 18 headed goals in the Premier League this season and 12 goals via substitutes, more than any other team in both categories.\nThe Reds have scored more goals against Newcastle in the Premier League than against any other team (98).\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah scored his 100th league goal in European top-flight football, with 56 of those coming in the Premier League (also 35 in Italian Serie A and 9 in Swiss Super League).\nLiverpool are the first team in Premier League history to have at least two defenders provide 10+ assists each in a single campaign (Trent Alexander-Arnold 11, Andy Robertson 11).\nNewcastle's Salomon Rondon has hit double figures for goals in a Premier League season for the first time.\nOnly Chelsea's Eden Hazard (48%) has had a hand in a higher proportion of his team's goals in the Premier League this season than Rondon (45% - scoring 10 goals and assisting 7 of 38).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool host Wolves at Anfield on the final day of the season - Sunday, 12 May - while Newcastle are away at Fulham, with both matches kicking off at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield 1-1 Man Utd: Solskjaer's side in Europa League after draw\nManchester United will have to settle for Europa League football next season after being held by a Huddersfield side who were relegated in March.\nThe Terriers had managed just four points in their previous 23 games - but watched by outgoing chairman Dean Hoyle, they earned a draw as Isaac Mbenza's first goal for the club levelled Scott McTominay's first-half effort.\nIn a frantic finish, young United substitute Tahith Chong had a shot saved and Paul Pogba hit the bar before David de Gea denied Karlan Grant a winner at the other end.\nIt means United have now gone five games without a win, their worst sequence since they went eight games without a victory under Louis van Gaal between November and December 2015.\nThe result means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side cannot catch either Chelsea or Tottenham and have only a slim chance of finishing above Arsenal in fifth.\nAlexis Sanchez is also a major doubt for the final game of the season against Cardiff at Old Trafford, having limped straight down the tunnel after suffering an injury at the start of the second half.\nHuddersfield are 11 points adrift at the bottom of the table and finish their season at Southampton next Sunday. United remain sixth and entertain Cardiff.\nRelive the action as Man Utd miss out on top-four finish\nRare Sanchez start\nSanchez was given his first start since 2 March as fellow strikers Romelu Lukaku and Anthony Martial were both missing through injury.\nThe Chilean is in the spotlight before a close season in which Solskjaer has already pledged extensive rebuilding.\nFor a basic salary in excess of \u00a3300,000 - there are also substantial add-ons - a return of one goal and three assists in the Premier League this season is woeful. In addition, Sanchez's salary is not helping United in their contract negotiations with players such as David de Gea, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera.\nYet again, Sanchez was on the periphery, making the odd decent contribution but nothing of great note until he succumbed to injury after 54 minutes.\nIn contrast, both De Gea and Mata had a more meaningful impact.\nDe Gea, under scrutiny after a string of disappointing mistakes, twice saved well from Karlan Grant, whilst Mata was by far United's most creative player and almost set up an opportunity for Pogba to double United's lead.\nPogba hit the bar in each half with curling shots but he was another highly-paid member of the United squad whose overall impact failed to match his reputation.\nHoyle farewell\nIt was a poignant afternoon for Huddersfield - their final home Premier League game for now, and the last time Hoyle sat in the directors' box as chairman.\nHoyle, 52, is a local businessman and a lifelong fan who took over the club in 2009 and oversaw their rise from League One as they reached the top flight for the first time since 1972.\nAfter recovering from a serious pancreatic condition, Hoyle has sold 75% of his stake in Huddersfield in completing a deal with another long-standing supporter, Phil Hodgkinson.\nSpeaking at a fans' function before the game, Hoyle said he had rejected larger offers from potential overseas investors - people he spoke to while he was in hospital - to 'keep the club local'.\nHuddersfield fans sang Hoyle's name after the game began and his on-pitch address at half-time, while barely audible to most supporters, was greeted with warm, enthusiastic and loud applause.\nHoyle even got something to celebrate as Mbenza scored his first goal in 23 Huddersfield appearances.\nThere was nothing subtle about his debut goal. Jonas Lossl's punt downfield was not dealt with by Luke Shaw, allowing Mbenza to run clear of the United defence and slot past the advancing David de Gea.\nThe goal meant Huddersfield avoided the ignominy of collecting two unwanted records for themselves - instead just sharing them.\nThey finish with the joint-lowest home goals total in the entire 131-year history of the English top division, equalling the 10 scored by Manchester City in 2006-07. And they end with the joint-highest number of Premier League home defeats since its inception in 1992, sitting level on 14 with Sunderland, who have set that mark twice.\nFraught summer ahead for Man Utd?\nUnited executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was repeatedly shown looking stony-faced as the second half drew to a close - and with good reason.\nHome-grown McTominay, United's April player of the month, was again the visitors' outstanding performer.\nThere was more than an element of luck about the Scotland midfielder's goal as Huddersfield keeper Jonas Lossl completely failed to deal with his shot from just inside the penalty area but there was an industry about McTominay's performance that his team-mates clearly lacked.\nWhat had, barely six weeks ago, looked like being a summer of promise for United, now looks fraught with problems.\nAnd, should Watford defeat Manchester City in the FA Cup final to earn a place in the Europa League group phase, United's lucrative pre-season tour will need to be cut short.\nThat is because United would have to start in the second qualifying round in July, requiring them to play on the same day as they are scheduled to face Tottenham in a pre-season game in Shanghai.\nMan of the match - Scott McTominay (Man Utd)\n'We don't deserve top four' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"It hurts whenever you don't win a game of football. In a stadium like this with loads of energy, their last game of the season at home, we gave them some hope and we couldn't reach our level again.\n\"There was always going to be a period in this game Huddersfield would press us because of the energy of the crowd. We had a spell we couldn't get going, now its done, we're disappointed but we have to look forward.\n\"We haven't deserved to be top four, we've chased the pack and been given chances, the league is so tight. When we got the opportunities we weren't able to really grab them. In the end, the table doesn't lie.\"\nOn Huddersfield's goal: \"Very avoidable; we've conceded too many of those this season. Everton, Wolves, today - it's something we must look at, improve on and not do that next season.\nHuddersfield manager Jan Siewert: \"Both teams had their chances. They're a good team but we wanted to give something back today to our supporters and to our chairman. The performance today showed me that we are on the right path.\n\"We are Terriers in our name, we must be that in body, we showed that today. Man United struggled today to make possibilities, we knew we'd have ours.\n\"Its a big, big time for the club. I must work a lot to prepare us for the Championship and find the players for how we want to play next year. We have one game to go, we'll show our possibilities but I'm excited to implement a way of playing. I know it will take time but the club will go through a exciting time.\"\nAnother Lossl assist against Man Utd - the stats\nJonas Lossl has assisted two Premier League goals for Huddersfield - both against Manchester United at the John Smith's Stadium.\nManchester United have failed to win both of their Premier League visits to the John Smith's Stadium (D1 L1); they are the only side to visit the ground more than once in the Premier League without winning.\nUnited are winless in six away games across all competitions (D1 L5), their poorest streak on their travels since November 2014 (nine games).\nOnly relegated Fulham and Huddersfield (both five) have kept fewer clean sheets in the Premier League this season than United (seven).\nThis draw ended Huddersfield's eight-match losing streak in the league: their joint-longest ever run of defeats in the Football League.\nHuddersfield avoided defeat in a Premier League match in which they fell behind for the first time since drawing 1-1 at Burnley in October 2018, ending a run of 23 straight league losses when trailing at any stage.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield visit Southampton next Sunday for their final Premier League game - for now, at least - while United again face a relegated side, with Cardiff visiting Old Trafford (both 15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-0 Watford: Blues win to secure Champions League place\nChelsea secured their place in the Champions League next season with victory over Watford at Stamford Bridge.\nThe win, combined with Arsenal's draw against Brighton, means the Blues are guaranteed a top-four finish in the Premier League.\nAfter a quiet first half, Chelsea scored twice within three minutes early in the second period through headers by Ruben Loftus-Cheek and David Luiz.\nGonzalo Higuain sealed the points with a neat finish from Pedro's pass for his fifth goal for the club.\nThe win moves Chelsea up to third, one point ahead of Tottenham and four points clear of the fifth-placed Gunners.\nFA Cup finalists Watford started brightly, going close through Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu, but were left to rue their slow start to the second half that saw Chelsea quickly take the game away from them.\nThe Hornets, who stay 10th, have now won just one of their past five Premier League games since their FA Cup semi-final victory over Wolves last month.\nRelive today's Premier League action\n'Chelsea will do well if Higuain stays'\nChelsea seal top four going into critical week\nChelsea's Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt is finely poised at 1-1 after the first leg, but Maurizio Sarri could not afford to rest players as he looked to maintain their push for a top-four finish.\nThe Chelsea boss says that he wants to treat all his remaining games \"with the same importance\".\nIt is a delicate balancing act for the Italian, who said he left Eden Hazard out of the starting line-up in Frankfurt on Thursday to keep him fresh for their bid to qualify for the Champions League.\nDespite the presence of the influential Belgian against Watford, Chelsea began the game sluggishly, with their only shot in target in the first half a chip from Jorginho that was awkwardly palmed away by Ben Foster.\nChelsea also suffered a blow early on when N'Golo Kante was forced off through injury and had to be replaced by Loftus-Cheek.\nThere was a smattering of boos from the home fans at the half-time whistle. But whatever Sarri said at the break had the desired effect as his side scored two quick-fire goals to take command of the game.\nHazard was the architect of both, his searching cross from the right following a short corner finding the head of Loftus-Cheek, who headed home his ninth goal of the season. Three minutes later, Hazard's corner found the unmarked Luiz, who powered another header past Foster.\nPedro and Higuain both drew smart stops from the Watford goalkeeper before the Argentine finished the game with 15 minutes left, running onto Pedro's sharp through-pass before chipping the onrushing Foster from a tight angle.\nWith speculation linking him with a summer departure, this could have been Hazard's final Premier League game for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\nIf that is the case then it was a fine way to bow out, though it also gave Chelsea a sharp reminder of what they will be missing if the Belgian leaves.\nGary Cahill was brought on in the final stages for his first competitive appearance since November before his expected departure from the club at the end of the season.\nWatford pay price for slow start to second half\nWatford's hopes of finishing seventh were already over going into this game after Wolves' win against Fulham on Saturday, meaning they have to beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final if they want to qualify for the Europa League.\nWatford head coach Javi Gracia named a strong side, including a return for captain and top scorer Troy Deeney after completing a three-match ban.\nThe Hornets boss says his players cannot afford to lose focus in their remaining league games with cup final starting places up for grabs. That was demonstrated by a lively start, with Deulofeu fizzing a 20-yard-effort just wide of the post before Deeney's powerful header was superbly clawed onto the post by Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nJose Holebas then fired over the bar from just inside the area as Watford continued to dominate the opening stages, sparking murmurs of frustration from the home crowd.\nBut after working so hard in the opening 45 minutes, Gracia must have been frustrated at their slow start to the second period, conceding twice from set pieces in quick succession.\nDeulofeu, the hero of Watford's FA Cup semi-final win over Wolves last month, continued to be a threat and was unlucky to see his low drive go just wide of the post with Kepa unmoved. Holebas then clipped the bar after stealing the ball from Mateo Kovacic just outside the area.\nWatford's day was perhaps summed up when a late header from Isaac Success was ruled out after the ball inadvertently hit team-mate Andre Gray, who was in an offside position.\nMan of the match - Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea)\n'It's difficult to accept this result' - what they said\nChelsea boss Maurizio Sarri, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"At the beginning we were tired physically and mentally. Then in the second half they lowered the intensity and we got in control of the match. It was very difficult in the first half and we were lucky because we scored two goals in three minutes and then after the second goal we were able to play good football.\n\"Ruben Loftus-Cheek is not just for me but for English football. He is improving match by match he can become one of the best midfielders in Europe, not only in England. He has very great potential and in the next season he will be for sure one of the best midfielders, not only in England.\n\"I don't know about Gonzalo Higuain's future, you have to ask the club. But for a striker it is not easy to play here, when you're used to playing in Spain and Italy. It's not easy to adapt to this competition because it's different physically. If he's staying then we can do very well in the next season.\n\"Gary Cahill is very important in the dressing room, very professional, he played only five or six matches this season but in training he was really very important for us. It was right to put him on the pitch for the last minutes.\"\nWatford boss Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's difficult to accept this result because we had a good performance in the first half and had very clear chances to score but didn't take them.\n\"Then in the second half, they scored from a corner kick, the second from another corner. It was difficult for us but if you analyse the play of the team we did many things well. We didn't confirm in the first half when we played better and after that we didn't deserve this result.\n\"I'm sad because we knew at the first corner they will do this and they did it and they scored. We need to be more aggressive to defend, more aggressive to finish and more clinical. Only playing well is not enough to win in these stadiums.\n\"We need to improve, it's not just bad luck, we need to be more aggressive to finish the chances we are creating. We dominated possession; we played more in the opposition half. I like how we played but we need to be more aggressive in both boxes.\"\nChelsea maintain winning run against Watford - the stats\nChelsea are unbeaten in 12 home matches against Watford in all competitions (W8 D4 L0) since a 5-1 defeat on the final day of the 1985-86 season.\nWatford have lost each of their past 11 Premier League clashes against 'big six' opposition, since beating Tottenham in September. The Hornets have conceded 27 goals in those 11 matches, scoring just six in return.\nWatford haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their past 40 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents, last recording a shutout in February 2016 against Chelsea at Vicarage Road.\nChelsea have named a starting XI with no English players for the 20th time in the Premier League this season - only Arsenal in 2006-07 (33) and 2007-08 (27) have done so more in a single campaign.\nChelsea winger Pedro has had a hand in six goals in his past five starts at Stamford Bridge in all competitions (four goals, two assists).\nEden Hazard has been directly involved in 31 Premier League goals for Chelsea this season (16 goals, 15 assists); only Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (32 - 2000-01), Frank Lampard (36 - 2009-10) and Didier Drogba (39 - 2009-10) have had a hand in more in a single campaign for Chelsea.\nHazard's 15 league assists is more than any other player in the big five European leagues in 2018-19.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea welcome Eintracht Frankfurt to Stamford Bridge on Thursday for the second leg of their Europa League semi-final (20:00 BST). The Blues then travel to Leicester while Watford host West Ham on the final day of the Premier League season next Sunday (both 15:00)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-1 Brighton: Hosts' top-four hopes all but over after lacklustre draw\nArsenal's focus is now on the Europa League, says boss Unai Emery, after his lacklustre side's hopes of a top-four Premier League finish were effectively ended by a draw with Brighton.\nThe Gunners are three points behind Tottenham in fourth with one game to play but would need an eight-goal swing, as well as results going their way, to overtake their rivals.\nBarring that highly improbable scenario, Arsenal will need to win the Europa League to play in the Champions League next season and take a 3-1 advantage into their semi-final second-leg in Valencia on Thursday.\n\"We knew it was going to be difficult but our focus is now the Europa League,\" Emery, who won the competition three times in a row with Sevilla, told BBC Sport.\n\"We have the opportunity in the Europa League to do something important and we will try and do that.\"\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang put Arsenal in front at Emirates Stadium with a ninth-minute penalty after Alireza Jahanbakhsh was judged to have fouled Nacho Monreal despite appearing to get the ball.\nAside from occasional bursts, Emery's side were shaky and sloppy, with Granit Xhaka committing an absurd foul on Solly March to concede a penalty that Glenn Murray converted on 61 minutes.\nArsenal frantically searched for a winner but Aubameyang volleyed wide from seven yards out and Brighton keeper Mat Ryan made a series of fine saves.\nPascal Gross could have won the game for Brighton late on but skewed his effort out towards the sideline with the goal unmanned after Bernd Leno's superb save from March, while the visitors withstood another flurry from Arsenal in the final stages.\nRelive Arsenal's draw with Brighton\nRamsey says emotional Arsenal farewell & Welbeck released\nSloppy Arsenal fail to scrape through\nLooking to avoid a fourth straight Premier League defeat, Arsenal made a bright start in attack, though were fortunate to be awarded a penalty, despite referee Anthony Taylor being well placed, with replays showing Jahanbakhsh got to the ball before Monreal fell.\nStill, an early lead through Aubameyang's 20th league goal of the season should have allowed the hosts to exert control over the game, but instead they became nervy and vulnerable.\nGoalkeeper Leno sent an abysmal clearance straight to March before recovering to save Murray's free header moments later, while Stephan Litchtsteiner, making his first appearance since late February, was frequently exposed.\nThere was another promising spell at the end of the first half, with Aubameyang, Shkodran Mustafi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan testing Ryan, but Arsenal's inability to create clear chances gave Brighton increasing confidence in finding an equaliser.\nEven then it took a staggeringly poor decision by Xhaka. Running behind the surging March inside the area, the Switzerland midfielder initially held up his hands to indicate he was not touching the Brighton forward only to then whack his shoulder and concede a penalty.\nAnd so a game Arsenal should perhaps have dictated against an opposition who were already guaranteed Premier League survival became a manic attempt to salvage a dispiriting end to the league season.\nThey came close to scraping a winner but could not do it, the lap of honour conducted with glum faces as the Gunners must now focus on winning the club's first European trophy since 1994.\nSafe Seagulls earn determined draw\nBrighton's Premier League status was confirmed on Saturday when Cardiff were relegated following defeat by Crystal Palace.\nBut Chris Hughton's side looked determined not to let their season drift away, encouraged by Arsenal's defensive frailty.\nMarch menaced Litchtsteiner, forced a save from Leno shortly after the break and made a fine run to win the penalty, perhaps going down easily but drawing contact from Xhaka, with Murray sending Leno the wrong way to score his 12th of the season.\nCentre-backs Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy made timely interventions and blocks, while Ryan continues to impress in goal.\nWith a more clinical edge, Brighton could have even won and completely ended Arsenal's top-four chances. First, Gross miscued his first-time strike after Leno had clawed away March's diving header in the 86th minute.\nThen in added time, substitute Florin Andone oddly failed to look up and play in the onrushing March when Brighton had a two-on-one situation against the stretched Arsenal defence.\nMan of the match - Solly March (Brighton)\n'That is more like us' - reaction\nArsenal boss Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We knew it was going to be difficult, but at 1-0 we needed to get the second goal. In the 90 minutes we controlled the match and after the first goal we tried to get the second.\n\"After their goal we created more chances to score but they defended very well, they are very strong defensively and they showed us that today.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton, speaking to BBC Sport: \"That's more like us. It was a good reaction and a response to going a goal behind early in the game, people would have expected them to turn it into two or three. We had to dig deep.\n\"I was unhappy with the penalty decision, my feeling was that it was soft and I couldn't understand how he gave it. I saw it again and I haven't changed my mind. It wasn't a penalty, and a very poor decision.\n\"But we bounced back and showed a lot of character. Our responsibility is to try and get a result in every game - we will want to do as well as we can against Manchester City next week.\"\nBrighton end 'big six' travel woes - stats\nArsenal are winless in their last four Premier League games (D1 L3), their longest run without a victory in the competition since February 2016 (also four games).\nBrighton avoided defeat away from home against 'big six' opposition for the first time in the Premier League - they had lost each of their last 11 games before today.\nArsenal have conceded 50 or more goals in consecutive top-flight campaigns for the first time since 1982-83 and 1983-84.\nArsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the sixth different player to score 20+ goals in a Premier League season for the club, and the first since Alexis Sanchez in 2016-17.\nSince making his debut in the competition in February 2018, only Mohamed Salah (35) has scored more Premier League goals than Aubameyang (30).\nGlenn Murray has scored 35% of Brighton's Premier League goals since the start of last season (24/68) - only Leicester's Jamie Vardy has netted a higher percentage of his team's goals in the competition in this period (36% - 38/107).\nWhat's next?\nOn the final day of the Premier League on Sunday, 12 May, Arsenal are away at Burnley, while Brighton host Manchester City, with both matches at 15:00 BST.\nBefore that, Arsenal face Valencia in the Europa League semi-final second leg on Thursday, leading 3-1 from the first leg."

We are away and we saw Brighton had a good game at Arsenal. But it is in our hands, don't forget but we could have been 10 points behind if we lost to Liverpool here.\n\"We were seven points behind, but we are in the last game and it is in our hands. We are going to prepare well.\n\"We'll see if Brighton defend deep or will be more offensive. It will be tough, but hopefully we will have the performance to be champions.\"\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers: \"Our motivation was to come in for our own development and performance. We pushed City, arguably the best team in Europe, right to the very end.\n\"I thought defensively and tactically, the team played a good game. They are difficult to contain with their quality and some world-class players.\n\"We will learn from this and look to end the season strongly.\"\nMan City beat everyone - the stats\nMan City have now scored 100 goals in all competitions at the Etihad this season; extending their record for most home goals by an English top-flight team in a single campaign.\nMan City have won each of their last 13 Premier League games - it's the fourth run of a team winning 13+ games in a row in the competition's history, with City the only side to have done so twice.\nMan City have beaten every team they have faced in the league for the second consecutive season; the only other English top-flight team to achieve this were Preston between 1888-89 and 1889-90.\nLeicester have won just one of their past seven away games versus Man City in all competitions (W1 D1 L5).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City will wrap the title up with a win over Brighton at Amex Stadium on the final day of the season - Sunday, 12 May - while Leicester host Chelsea at King Power Stadium. Both matches kick off at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 0-2 Cardiff City: Mendez-Laing scores twice as hosts crash again\nNathaniel Mendez-Laing scored twice as relegated Cardiff City won on their final Premier League appearance to heap more misery on Manchester United.\nMendez-Laing opened the scoring for Cardiff from the penalty spot after being brought down in the box by Diogo Dalot, before scoring his second after the break.\nGoalkeeper Neil Etheridge proved the visitors' hero as he foiled several United chances on a frustrating day for the hosts, who fielded six academy graduates.\nDefeat means United have won just one of their final seven games of the season as city rivals Manchester City won the Premier League title for the second season in succession.\nCardiff travelled to Old Trafford just a week after confirmation of their relegation to the Championship and looked set to bid farewell to the top flight with a whimper as United dominated the opening exchanges.\nBut it was United who finished the match with their tails between their legs, unable to defy a resolute Bluebirds defence as they rained chance after chance on Etheridge's goal.\nCardiff's victory was their first over Manchester United since 3 April, 1954, when manager Neil Warnock was just five years old.\n'Not a cat in hell's chance' - Warnock says he won't manage in Premier League again\nManchester United v Cardiff as it happened\nNightmare season finally over for United\nWith Europa League status secured for next season, this campaign proved one to forget for United as they look to rebuild over the summer.\nAnder Herrera confirmed this week he would leave the club after a five-year stay, and the exit door at Old Trafford could be busy with Antonio Valencia also departing.\nSolskjaer looked to have turned United's fortunes around as they went 12 league games unbeaten after his arrival.\nBut the wave they were riding crashed in March, and the Norwegian will spend the summer building his own team rather than the one he inherited from Jose Mourinho in December.\nBut while he will be keen to bring in players from elsewhere, the club's youngsters will no doubt be much involved next season.\nAt 17 years and 223 days, Mason Greenwood became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for the Red Devils, and he more than showed his potential against Cardiff as the sole ray of sunshine in a gloomy United performance.\nHe had a handful of chances to score, twice going close with headers before Mendez-Laing scored his first and testing Etheridge not long after with a deflected effort on goal.\nEighteen-year-old Angel Gomes came off the bench late on with he and Greenwood scuffing chances to pull something back for United as they end the season in sixth, 32 points adrift of champions Manchester City.\nBluebirds end top-flight stay on a high\nThe 2018-19 season has been one in which Cardiff has united as a club, and manager Warnock was all smiles at full-time despite his side's demotion.\nWhether he will still be in charge of the club next season remains to be seen, with owner Vincent Tan keen to retain the 70-year-old who has one more year remaining on his contract.\nThe Bluebirds can be proud of the performance with which they downed United, weathering an early storm to shock their hosts by taking an early lead.\nWith nothing at stake, Mendez-Laing coolly slotted home his spot-kick, sending David de Gea the wrong way as his team-mates in defence stopped every United break in its tracks.\nIt was more of the same after the break as Mendez-Laing, completely unmarked just metres out from the United goal, tapped in a Josh Murphy cross to double his and Cardiff's tally.\nBut Cardiff had Etheridge to thank for keeping them in the game as the keeper's rapid reactions kept out a Marcus Rashford bullet header just moments after the second goal, before stoppong a powerful Paul Pogba effort with 20 minutes to go.\nCardiff finish the season just three points from safety but with some pride intact.\n'It was not good enough' - what they said\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"Today was not the problem. You can have all the possession and chances you want but we concede easy goals and don't score at the other [end]. We have a long and hard way to be where we want to be.\n\"Mason Greenwood was brilliant, he was our best player by a mile and that says a lot about the kid. He came into a team with a lack of confidence and you can see that has taken a toll. I'm not surprised by his performance, we know he is capable of that.\n\"It will take some time to close in on the top, we finished five or six points behind third, fourth, fifth and that has to be our aim. The top two teams have set a standard higher than before and we have to take up the next challenge.\n\"The work starts now. Everyone has the summer off but we have to come back with a different mentality and different attitude of being a Man United team.\n\"The ones who played, did well but it was not good enough.\"\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock: \"We were super today, so were the amazing fans. I am really proud of the whole club. We did not set out to defend and thought we had a chance to put a dent in some of the bookies today.\n\"My last game in the Premier League, I wanted the players to play for me today. With a bit of luck, we would have stayed up. We have developed as a team.\n\"I am having a meeting with the chairman and chief executive on Monday. The club is in a strong position from when I took over and they can push on like Burnley did when they went down. I will leave the club in a good state whenever I leave.\n\"The fans have been brilliant all the time. I have never worked as hard as I have this season, I have never had so many knock-backs and then I get a performance like that after being relegated.\n\"I felt the club needed me when the Emiliano Sala tragedy happened. I felt I had to be the front man. It was difficult and I have never experienced anything like that. We came through it intact and I am proud of that.\"\nMan of the match - Neil Etheridge (Cardiff)\nThe stats\nManchester United have only kept two home clean sheets in the Premier League this season, their fewest at Old Trafford in a top-flight campaign since 1962-63 (2).\nCardiff became the first newly-promoted team to win away at United in the top-flight by a 2+ goal margin since Nottingham Forest in December 1977 (4-0).\nCardiff won an away league match against United at Old Trafford for the first time since April 1954, ending a run of seven games without a win (W0 D2 L5).\nUnited have finished 32 points behind the champions this season - more than they finished behind the top-flight winners when they were relegated in 1973-74 (30 points).\nCardiff attempted 11 shots in the first half against United - the most by an away team at Old Trafford in the first half of a Premier League game this season.\nMason Greenwood (17 years, 223 days) became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United.\nCardiff's Nathaniel Mendez-Laing is only the second player from a newly-promoted team to score a brace away at Old Trafford in the Premier League after Louis Saha for Fulham in August 2001."

        "article_text": "Fulham 0-4 Newcastle United: Rafael Benitez to hold more contract talks\nRafael Benitez once again remained coy over his future at Newcastle after his side signed off their Premier League campaign with an impressive victory at relegated Fulham.\nThe 59-year-old's contract is set to expire on 30 June and talks have been ongoing with club chiefs for several weeks, with the Spanish manager previously stating that the ball was in their court.\nEarlier this season Benitez suggested he requires a transfer budget\n, external\nthat will allow the Magpies to make the step up after a second successive mid-table finish.\nHe told BBC's Match of the Day: \"We meet hopefully this week and see where we are. We have plenty of time to enjoy, I have been very clear about the potential of this club.\"\nUnder the gaze of owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley, the ex-Liverpool boss strengthened his position as the Magpies barely broke sweat on their way to a thumping victory at Craven Cottage.\nThey were two goals up in a two-minute spell early in the match. Midfielder Jonjo Shelvey ended his year-long run without a goal with a thunderous half-volley from just inside the area before Ayoze Perez grabbed his 13th of the season when he tucked home after goalkeeper Sergio Rico failed to adequately deal with Christian Atsu's shot.\nDefender Fabian Schar nodded in the Magpies' third just after the hour mark before Salomon Rondon capped off his own brilliant display with an angled strike which produced the loudest cheer of the afternoon.\nThe Magpies finish in 13th with 45 points, one more than they managed last season, and Scott Parker's side end their campaign in 19th and with 26 points.\nRelive the action from Craven Cottage\nFollow the reaction from the final day of the Premier League season\nFulham's fragile defence suffers again\nA penny for Scott Parker's thoughts as he stood in deep contemplation during the final stages of the match.\nThe former assistant was handed the top job permanently this week and with it the task of reinvigorating an expensively-assembled outfit that many expected to do well, but in the end failed to meet acceptable standards.\nHe said after his appointment that \"success comes from a foundation, that foundation comes from a culture and setting standards on a daily basis\".\nIn the first few minutes of the match, his side set high standards as they tested the visiting defence with balls flung in from both wings - Aleksandar Mitrovic went close with a header that drifted a foot wide of Martin Dubravka's post.\nThe ex-Newcastle striker also had a chance with another header that should have found the target but aside from that, and a good strike by 16-year-old substitute Harvey Elliott, the Slovak keeper had a fairly quiet day at the office.\nIt has been their defence which has been been Fulham's Achilles heel. Every time Newcastle attacked, they looked liable to concede. Rondon's late strike was the 81st conceded in the league this season - five more than bottom club Huddersfield.\nTop of Parker's summer shopping list must be a new backline.\nMagpies end the season on a high - questions remain\nFor the second successive season finale, Benitez walked out on to the turf at the final whistle with a smile wider than the mouth of the Tyne.\nIt was mission accomplished after another campaign in which his side flirted with the relegation places. Aside from unanswered questions over his own future there remains the unresolved issue over whether the club will sign 12-goal striker Rondon on a permanent deal.\nThe Venezuelan and Perez have combined brilliantly in the second part of the season to lift the Magpies away from the scrap to avoid the drop. However, it was Shelvey, a less influential fixture this season, who set the visitors on their way with a exceptional strike which flew past the reach of Sergio Rico.\nSoon after the restart Perez, arguably Newcastle's player of the season, tapped in his sixth goal in five games after the ball from Atsu's blocked shot came back to him.\nSchar, who will be remembered for his 25-yard cracker against Burnley, headed in his fourth of the season after the break before Rondon rounded off a fitting climax for himself and his team in the 90th minute.\nBenitez added: \"This group of players from beginning until the end have worked really hard. We never gave up, even when we were safe in the last three games they were still giving everything.\n\"We have one more point than last season but couldn't finish 10th so it proves this season has been more difficult than last season.\"\nMan of the match - Salomon Rondon (Newcastle)\n'It will be foot to the floor' - the quotes\nFulham manager Scott Parker: \"It is frustrating, really frustrating. We had become a bit more resilient but today I felt at times there were signs of the old us.\n\"When the game becomes a basketball match for us, which I mean back and forth, we are the side that look like they are going to concede.\n\"Of course it has been a disappointing season but in football as quick as you are down you are always around the corner from a new challenge and the new challenge is the Championship next season. There were signs in our play today of what we are trying to do and that is something I love but, of course, there are some other things I am not keen on.\n\"We will be in tomorrow and will go through the finer details of pre-season. We will take a break next week and then it will be foot to the floor.\"\nPerez on fire again - the stats\nNewcastle have won their first league match at Craven Cottage since December 2007 - after a run of six defeats away at Fulham.\nNewcastle have scored four goals away from home in a league match for the first time since September 2016 (6-0 v Queens Park Rangers).\nThere was just 124 seconds between Shelvey's opener and Perez's second for Newcastle in their match against Fulham.\nFulham conceded two goals in the first 11 minutes of the match against Newcastle - the earliest they had conceded twice in a Premier League game since May 2011 v Liverpool.\nMatt Ritchie has provided 20 league assists since his Newcastle debut in August 2016; seven more than any other player.\nEight of Newcastle's last 15 Premier League goals have been scored by Perez.\nPerez is one of four players to score 10 Premier League goals in 2019 along with Liverpool's Sadio Mane (14), Leicester's Jamie Vardy (12) and Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (12)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-4 West Ham: Clinical Hammers secure top-10 finish\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini feels his team has \"grown a step\" as they clinched a top-10 finish for the first time since 2016 with an emphatic win over FA Cup finalists Watford at Vicarage Road.\nTwo goals from Mark Noble, plus one each from Manuel Lanzini and Marko Arnautovic sealed the points at Vicarage Road as Watford struggled after Jose Holebas was sent off for tugging back Michail Antonio.\nPellegrini, whose team have won their final three games of the season, said: \"I think that we have grown a step this season and we are happy to finish the way we did.\n\"We have improved on points, goals scored and goals conceded. I think the fans have enjoyed it more than they did last season.\"\nCaptain Noble got them off to the perfect start against the run of play, swapping passes with Antonio before dancing past Christian Kabasele to slot home the opener.\nLanzini doubled their lead five minutes before the break, heading home after Antonio's rasping drive had been turned on to the crossbar by Ben Foster.\nGerard Deulofeu briefly gave Watford hope as he scored 11 seconds into the second half, but just two minutes later the hosts were reduced to 10 men as Holebas was dismissed for hauling back Antonio.\nWatford visibly tired and Arnautovic took full advantage to seal the three points after Foster had saved Felipe Anderson's volley on to the post.\nThere was still time for Antonio to win a penalty for West Ham and Noble duly dispatched his second of the game past a wrong-footed Foster.\nThis result means Watford have managed just one win in six going into the FA Cup final with Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday.\nFollow reaction to today's Premier League action here\nAntonio sets tone for clinical West Ham\nAntonio may not have got the goal his dynamic performance deserved but he played a crucial part in West Ham's victory.\nHe scored the winner in West Ham's last away game at Tottenham and his bristling threat caused Watford problems all afternoon.\nHe served notice of his speed early on, barracking past Kabasele only to be squeezed out by Foster.\nShortly afterwards he got the first of his assists, showing excellent strength to hold off challenges from three Watford defenders before unleashing a venomous strike that Foster turned on to the crossbar.\nThe West Ham players rushed to congratulate him as much as their goalscorer Lanzini, who nodded the rebound home.\nAfter Deulofeu's goal briefly threatened a Watford revival, it was Antonio who nudged in behind the home defence and forced Holebas to tug him back, resulting in a red card for the defender and killing Watford's comeback.\nHe may have fallen a little easily for the West Ham penalty but there was no doubt that Kiko Femenia pulled him down, leaving Noble with the simple task of scoring from the spot.\nIt's been an inconsistent season for West Ham - excellent wins against Arsenal and Tottenham undermined by defeats at Cardiff and Brighton - but three successive wins to round off the campaign hints at a brighter future for Manuel Pellegrini's men.\nWatford end league campaign on a low\nFor most of the season, Watford have been overachievers, winning their first four games and being a firm fixture in the Premier League's top 10.\nJavi Gracia's side have been consistently solid, carried a real threat through Deulofeu and Troy Deeney, and made light work of the sides below them in the table.\nThey have secured their highest Premier League finish and best points tally, and have won plenty of friends with their performances.\nHowever, since making the FA Cup final in dramatic fashion five weeks ago, their form has tailed off drastically and it looks a tall order for them to topple Manchester City's treble quest at Wembley next week.\nAt times, they looked good against Watford. Slick interplay spearheaded by Abdoulaye Doucoure and Deulofeu deserved more, and being two goals down after dominating the first half was harsh.\nIt might have been different had Lukasz Fabianski not pulled off a wonder save from Troy Deeney on the stroke of half time or referee Christopher Kavanagh shown Holebas a yellow card instead of a red for the challenge on Antonio just two minutes after Deulofeu had halved the deficit.\n\"We will appeal the red card,\" Watford manager Javi Gracia said. \"It made it impossible for us and for a player to miss the FA Cup final based on that contact is not right.\n\"I want to recognise the work my players have done over the whole season as we have achieved the best season ever in the Premier League, and now we have the chance to play the FA Cup final.\"\nUnfortunately for Watford, their brave resistance wilted in the May sunshine and the Hornets were grateful to their 36-year-old keeper Foster for his fine saves of Arnautovic and Antonio in the final quarter.\nManager Gracia has proved himself to be a canny tactician all season.\nHe will need all of his nous at Wembley next week.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio\n'I didn't think it was a red card' - what they said\nWatford goalkeeper Ben Foster: \"We are really disappointed as we got into unbelievable positions and should have put the ball in the net. I didn't think it was a red card at all. It was a coming-together and one player has fallen down. I'm gutted for Jose Holebas that he won't play in the FA Cup final.\"\nWest Ham captain Mark Noble: \"The fans can be excited for next season as we've played some really good stuff. If we'd played like we had for the last month, we'd be a bit higher.\"\nMore red cards for Watford - the stats\nDespite their defeat today, Watford recorded their highest season finish (11th) in the top-flight of English football since 1986-87 (9th place).\nWest Ham won 15 games and picked up 52 points in the Premier League this season, both their most in a campaign since 2015-16 (16 wins, 62 points).\nWatford haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their last 12 Premier League games - only once previously have they had a longer such streak in the competition (20 games between September 1999 and March 2000).\nWest Ham have won consecutive away games in the Premier League for just the second time under manager Manuel Pellegrini, having previously won three in a row in December 2018.\nSince their return to the Premier League in 2015-16, Watford have picked up 16 red cards in the competitions, more than any other side.\nOnly Paolo Di Canio (47) has scored more Premier League goals for West Ham United than Mark Noble (42).\nGerard Deulofeu's goal for Watford (45:11) was the quickest at the start of the second half in the Premier League since January 2018 (also 45:11 - West Ham's Marko Arnautovic v Huddersfield).\nManuel Lanzini scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham since the final day of the 2017-18 season (two goals against Everton on May 13, 2018).\nWhat's next?\nWatford have their first FA Cup final in 35 years on Saturday, 18 May when they face Premier League champions Manchester City at Wembley (17:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-0 Wolves: Reds fall short in title bid despite win over Wolves\nLiverpool's bid for a first Premier League title and a first top-flight triumph in 29 years ended in failure despite a final-day victory over Wolves.\nIn the 'as it stands' table, the Reds were top for 21 first-half minutes, only for Manchester City to recover from falling behind at Brighton to record a convincing 4-1 victory.\nSadio Mane scored from close range after 17 minutes and again after 81 to join Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as the Premier League's top scorer on 22 goals.\nLiverpool keeper Alisson was confirmed as the Golden Glove winner with 21 clean sheets.\nThe victory was Liverpool's ninth in a row and their 30th overall in the league. They finished on 97 points, the third-highest top-flight total in English football history - behind City's title triumphs this season (98) and last season (100).\n'Jurgen Klopp restores Liverpool's fire to offer hope amid title pain'\n'Special season' is only the first step - Klopp\nThe best top two in history - the numbers behind remarkable title race\nThe 11mm title? The tiny margins that decided an extraordinary battle\nFrom the chief exec's Pep talk to Silva surprise - unseen moments that defined Man City's season\nSalah, Mane & Aubameyang share the Golden Boot\nSmoke, songs and a sea of red\nThe arrival of the Liverpool team bus has become an event in itself.\nHalf an hour before it turned onto Anfield Road, thousands were on the street waiting for its arrival. Supporters in the hospitality areas at the top of the magnificent new main stand looked down onto a sea of red, numerous flares going off as Jurgen Klopp and his side turned slowly left and drove into the stadium, the smoke clogging the air in unison with the songs being belted out.\nMany of those fans were either not alive, or old enough to remember the last time Liverpool were champions. The banner that was slowly handed across the lower tier of the Kenny Dalglish Stand before kick-off proclaiming '18 times' was a statement about the club's glorious past, before a game that might have ushered in a bright new future.\nAs the pre-match atmosphere grew and the teams went through their warm-ups, Klopp stood alone with his thoughts, knowing he had already delivered a season beyond any realistic expectation yet, incredibly, without being able to go into the final day as favourite.\nConfusion in the crowds, controlled on the pitch\nIn his programme notes, Klopp pointed out \"the job for all of us today is to make sure the focus stays here, on this game\". Quite rightly, he pointed out, it was the only thing Liverpool had any control over.\nTo their absolute credit, Klopp and his players followed the plea completely.\nIn the stands though, it was chaos.\nFrom kick-off, the volume was turned up a notch or two, the backing from the supporters to players hugely impressive, so much so that when Sadio Mane tapped home from six yards there was no noticeable change.\nThat didn't happen for about another eight minutes.\nWho knows how these things get started but cheers were heard for a Brighton goal that hadn't actually been scored. Fans all over were desperately trying to find out what was going on. Anyone who has tried to get a signal at any major sporting event knows that is not straightforward.\nPhones were refreshed and refreshed. The noise subsided. Nothing had happened. Then it did.\nThe celebration at Brighton's goal was more feverish than had been the case for Mane's. The sadness was that it was brought to an end quite so quickly. For 10 more minutes, Liverpool were still top. There was another ghost goal, another celebration. This time more muted. The optimism from before was disappearing. The belief starting to fade.\nNews City had gone in front came via the Wolves supporters, who taunted their hosts by telling them they would win nothing this season.\nBy the time Martin Atkinson blew his whistle for half-time, Matt Doherty had hit the bar for the visitors and the home fans had found their voice again. Anfield echoed to the strains of \"Liverpool we love you\".\nAnd now for Europe\nIt did not feel like the league title was on the line in the second half.\nWolves, as they have done so often against the big six this season, gave ample evidence to show they are a very good team. Next season they may go beyond their seventh-placed finish, their best since 1980, with astute recruitment in the summer.\nAs the goals went in on the south coast, Diogo Jota brought a good save from Alisson with his close-range header before Mane converted Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross nine minutes from time.\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain made only his second appearance of the season as a late substitute before the whistle blew on Liverpool's amazing domestic campaign.\nWolves will qualify for next season's Europa League if Manchester City complete the first ever domestic treble against Watford in the FA Cup final at Wembley next Saturday.\nLiverpool will aim for their sixth European title when they play Tottenham in the Champions League final in Madrid on 1 June.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\n'We could not shake City off' - what the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I know people will find something and say a point here or three. We had lucky moments, City had lucky moments - against Burnley and us. But we scored a strange goal against Everton and a late one against Newcastle.\n\"It's not about outplaying everyone, it's about keeping believing and staying in the race. City found it difficult to get rid of us, and we couldn't get rid of them.\n\"Being second in the Premier League isn't what we wanted tonight but we'll take it. This is a first step, that's how we see it. The team who played the last couple of weeks were together last year apart from Alisson.\n\"We were 25 points off last season. If we do those same steps again that will be a season.\n\"I do my job. The boys deserve it 100%. Congratulations to Manchester City, they played a good season. They took 198 points in two seasons, not bad.\"\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo: \"We had a good game against a fantastic opponent. We started not so good but we had good chances.\n\"It's the end of the season. Until the last minute we showed total commitment and that's what I went. We had chances but weren't clinical. We knew we would be facing a tough opponent. The commitment, belief and ideas were there.\n\"We will try to improve and build a good team next season.\"\nWhat have you got to do to win the title? The stats you may have missed\nLiverpool became the first team in top-flight history to win as many as 30 games and 97 points in a season and not win the title.\nNo side has ever previously lost just one game in a top-flight season and not won the title - the previous record was also held by Liverpool in the 2008-09 season (two defeats, finished second).\nLiverpool's tally of 97 points would have been enough to win the Premier League in all but one of the previous 26 seasons of the competition (2017-18).\nWolves have ended the season in seventh position - the highest by a newly promoted side in the Premier League since Ipswich Town finished fifth in 2000-01.\nSadio Mane scored 18 home Premier League goals for Liverpool in 2018-19 - the most by any player, and eight more than Huddersfield Town scored in total in their home games this season.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold provided 12 assists for Liverpool in the Premier League this season - the most by a defender in a single campaign in the competition's history.\nLiverpool won 22 home matches at Anfield in all competitions this season, their most home wins in a season since 2000-01 (also 22)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Huddersfield: Alex Pritchard punishes Angus Gunn in draw at St Mary's\nAlex Pritchard capitalised on Southampton keeper Angus Gunn's mistake to rescue a draw for Huddersfield in their final Premier League game before dropping into the Championship.\nThe hosts were cruising after Nathan Redmond's opener but Saints goalkeeper Gunn was too relaxed on the ball as Pritchard stole possession and rolled in a second-half equaliser.\nRedmond had fired a stunning opener after a disappointing first 40 minutes as Southampton looked on course to end a run of four games without victory.\nJames Ward-Prowse nearly doubled Saints' lead with an equally fierce strike after the interval but Premier League debutant Joel Coleman acrobatically tipped the ball over the bar.\nPritchard's equaliser ensured the Terriers claimed only their seventh point on the road as they finished bottom of the table.\nWhile Huddersfield drop down a division after two seasons in the Premier League, Southampton will have to eliminate their mistakes if they are to avoid flirting with a similar fate next season.\nEnd of season feel in the sunshine\nWith nothing riding on the result, the game failed to live up to the glorious weather on the south coast and Karlan Grant's tame effort was the only shot on target for 40 minutes in the beaming sunshine.\nBut with the game heading for the break, Redmond cut inside on to his favoured right foot before smashing past Coleman from just outside the area.\nThe visitors fluorescent shirts aside, the winger was the brightest spark on display, also making more key passes (6) than any other player on the pitch.\nAs he said after the game, the \"end of season feel\" made it difficult with \"nothing to play for\".\nGunn's careless error certainly added to the match's lackadaisical feel.\nThe 23-year-old was in no apparent danger from Ryan Bertrand's pass back, but his touch eluded him allowing Pritchard to take possession and score in front of the vociferous Huddersfield fans.\nSouthampton finished just five points above the drop zone and Ralph Hasenhuttl's recruitment drive over the summer will be key to ensuring they finish in a better position this time next year.\nLate season promise for Terriers\nHuddersfield's relegation was eventually confirmed six weeks ago during a hugely disappointing campaign.\nGoals have been a real issue for the Terriers and Gunn's final day gift was only their 22nd of the season - just four more than Derby County's Premier League record from 2007-08 for the fewest goals in a season.\nJan Siewert's side only produced three attempts on target, as Grant struck two shots from distance straight at Gunn before Pritchard secured a share of the spoils.\nHowever, seven goals in their last eight games, compared to four in their opening 10, suggests the west Yorkshire club played with greater freedom and attacking intent once their fate was sealed.\nA home draw with Manchester United and an away point at Southampton are two credible results to end an otherwise forgetful season, and Siewert will be hoping his players can carry that momentum through the summer into next term.\nHuddersfield may face a battle to keep some of their key players but retaining the likes of Pritchard and Aaron Mooy, who made more passes in the opposition half than any other player (42), will be crucial in their chances of returning to the top-flight.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond (Southampton)\n'Every time we make a mistake it's a goal' - what they said\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: \"We had the chances to kill the game but the problem with clean sheets has been a picture of the season. We must stop these mistakes and today it was Angus Gunn. We want to play out but decision making and good anticipation is important. At that moment we cannot dribble out like Angus did and it's been unbelievable this year that when we make a mistake it's a goal. We have to sort that next season.\n\"We know we have a lot of things to do in the summer and we will, with this squad and new players also. We need to bring a few guys in and then we have to work hard with them.\"\nOn Nathan Redmond's performance: \"It is one of his biggest threats to go inside and finish with the right foot. We had other chances but it is disappointing not to win the game and jump another place in the table.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Huddersfield manager Jan Siewert said: \"I would say we got a positive result. It's not easy after being relegated to play Man Utd and Southampton. I could see they were exhausted so it's credit to my players. We wanted to build momentum and we could have made more of our chances in the first half. Then they scored so we had to take that. It was a tough season for everyone at the club so it's important we forget about the season and go away on holiday and refresh.\"\nOn Joel Coleman's Premier League debut: \"He deserved his chance and I think he took it. These last two results will stay in the minds of the supporters and we have a chance to build on it. I'm looking forward to building in the summer but I'm looking forward to a holiday. There might be some interest in our players from other clubs but we have to make decisions which will suit our club and we have to look forward.\"\nRedmond's best season comes to an end - the stats\nOnly Derby in 2007-08 (11) and Sunderland in 2005-06 (15) have won fewer points in a single Premier League season than Huddersfield in 2018-19 (16).\nHuddersfield (-54) are just the second side in a 20-team Premier League season to finish with a goal difference worse than -50 after Derby County in 2007-08 (-69).\nSouthampton are unbeaten in their last five meetings with Huddersfield in all competitions (W2 D3), winning one and drawing three of their four Premier League games.\nSouthampton's Nathan Redmond has been directly involved in 10 Premier League goals this season (6 goals, 4 assists); his best return for goal involvements in a single campaign in the top-flight.\nNathan Redmond has scored as many Premier League goals under Ralph Hasenhuttl in 23 appearances (six) as he managed in his previous 75 Southampton matches."

I did not want them to play and only focus on me. I am a team player. The team have had a great season but last month it has not been the best in the league.\"\nA Burnley goal always seemed likely and, when it arrived, it was the 51st Arsenal had conceded in the league this season, matching last season's total as the most they have conceded in a Premier League campaign.\nAll eyes are now on the trip to Baku and a chance to win not only a trophy but get back into Europe's elite.\nFollowing that, Emery will need funds in the summer if he is to shore up his leaky defence while bettering this season's tally of just seven away wins will also be crucial if a top four finish is to be achieved. There could also be more involvement for Nketiah who scored his first Premier League goal in a lively cameo.\n\"I am proud of the players, we deserve to be fighting for the top four. At the last moment we didn't take it, but we are closer to the other teams,\" said Emery. \"Our first target in the league we can not take, but we have the Europa League to play for one title and this [Champions League] target.\nBurnley's long season finally over\nA 15th placed league finish is reward for a tough season that started on 26 July against Aberdeen in the Europa League qualifiers.\nTheir league form suffered and they sat in the relegation zone at Christmas and they never looked like reaching the heights that took them to seventh place last season.\nBut with safety secured at the end of last month, Sean Dyche could look forward to a long summer off and a full pre-season.\nNot that his side played like their minds were on their upcoming holidays as they dominated for large parts of the game. Chris Wood went closest when his shot hit the inside of the post, while Matthew Lowton's shot from close range was blocked by Mustafi in the first-half.\nThey battled hard and, in a feisty encounter, five Clarets players ended up in Mike Dean's book.\nEven after going behind, they showed character to pull one back and substitute Peter Crouch also went close at the end.\n\"I was pleased with today's performance but the cutting edge was lacking,\" said Dyche.\n\"I have been proud of the players all season. The way they have taken on the second-half of the season. They were under duress around Christmas, the noise outside the camp was people saying we were finished, but the way they have seen through that, concentrated and focused on the challenge in front has been magnificent.\"\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\nArsenal love the final day - the best stats\nBurnley have lost each of their last 10 meetings with Arsenal in all competitions\nArsenal haven't lost on the final day of a Premier League season since the 2004-05 campaign at Birmingham. The Gunners have won their final Premier League game of the season 18 times - no side has done so more\nArsenal have kept just one clean sheet away from home in the Premier League this season, their fewest in a single top-flight campaign since 1967-68 (also one)\nEddie Nketiah is the first teenager to score a Premier League goal for Arsenal since Alex Iwobi netted against Watford in April 2016\nAubameyang (31) is only the second Premier League player to score 30+ goals in all competitions this season, after Sergio Aguero\nBarnes has scored 12 Premier League goals this season, more than any other Burnley player in a single campaign in the competition"

We tried to win with him later on in the last 25 minutes. I think Eden has played here in Chelsea for seven seasons, trying in every match to do his best and now it's time to respect his decision, but I hope he will remain with us.\n\"The season is good. We were in trouble two or three months ago but third place is a very good result. Now we have to go to Baku for the Europa League final and we have the chance for our season to be wonderful.\"\nOn playing a friendly in the United States in midweek: \"It's a double feeling. I'm happy because we go there for a good reason. As a coach I am worried because we are tired and need to rest.\"\nLeicester City manager Brendan Rodgers: \"It was a very good game. They had one or two chances as did we. I was pleased with the mentality of the players and we didn't concede, which was important.\n\"Jamie [Vardy] is a constant threat - we had a few moments where we got in but it was just that final pass. The quality we showed at times was very good.\n\"They want to learn. We beat Arsenal, played well against Manchester City and got a point today. People thought we would not get any points from the last three games. It's been a nice induction into the club - the players have been good, the supporters. We'll now add that bit of depth to the squad.\"\nGolden oldie Caballero - the stats\nThere has been just one goal scored in the last three Premier League meetings between Leicester and Chelsea.\nThis was Chelsea's fourth goalless draw in the Premier League this season, their most since 2013-14 (also four).\nChelsea won just two of their last nine Premier League away games this season (W2 D2 L5), drawing their last two.\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers has faced Chelsea more often than any other Premier League side without winning (nine games - W0 D5 L4).\nChelsea ended the season in 3rd position, the 13th time in the last 16 seasons they've finished in the top-three of the Premier League.\nWilly Caballero, aged 37 years and 226 days, became Chelsea's second oldest Premier League player - only Mark Schwarzer has featured for the Blues at an older age (41y 217d in May 2014).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to the United States for a friendly against New England Revolution on Wednesday, 15 May before they face Arsenal in an all-English Europa League final in Baku, Azerbaijan on Wednesday, 29 May (20:00 BST)."

It took two preventable goals in three minutes from the visitors for Spurs to refocus.\nAnd it was Eriksen, absent for much of the game, who stepped up to deliver a moment of quality from his free-kick to ensure Tottenham would not depart for Madrid with defeat.\nManager Pochettino has said he would be \"stupid\" to stay at the club if he's expected to maintain his current levels of success without the club changing the way it operates, and this campaign - regardless of the outcome in three weeks' time - means Spurs must do whatever it takes to keep the Argentine at the club.\n\"I want to congratulate my players, they are superheroes,\" said Pochettino.\n\"I feel so proud but we have not finished our season. We have three weeks to prepare for the final, which will be one of the most important games in our history. The characteristic of this season is never giving up. The team's spirit has been fantastic.\"\nEverton's strong finish offers optimism under Silva\nA positive concluding chapter to Silva's first season with the Toffees ensured his side equalled their eighth place under Sam Allardyce following an unsettled 2017-18 campaign.\nA bright start to life under the Portuguese filled many with optimism, however a striking mid-season lull reminiscent of Silva's previous Premier League season at Watford rightly drew concern among fans.\nYet their closing form has been inspired, with victories over Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal in a run that has seen them suffer just two defeats in their final 11 league games.\nBut Everton, unable to catch Wolves in seventh before kick-off, were punished for a lethargic opening 20 minutes at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nThey survived persistent attacks from the hosts to remain in the contest until Bernard's testing low shot signalled a change in momentum.\nBernard and Lucas Digne linked up effortlessly down the left throughout but it was Walcott driving in from the opposite side that brought Everton level.\nThat was the start of a frantic period which saw Tosun eventually bundle the ball over the line before Eriksen left Jordan Pickford with little hope of keeping out Spurs' second.\nLast year, it was a resolute Burnley that prevented Everton taking the 'best of the rest' spot outside the top six, while this year it is an inspired Wolves.\nIt's 34 Premier League away matches since Everton last defeated one of the established top-six sides so success next season must surely be judged on Silva's ability to close the gap with the league's heavy-hitters.\n\"To be a top six club in this country now is really tough,\" said Silva.\n\"We must be realistic for our team. We must work hard and do everything perfectly. We will try, our job is to work really hard every day and improve what we did the season before. I have no doubts we are a stronger team than at the start of the season.\"\nMan of the match - Lucas Digne (Everton)\nEriksen strike breaks Premier League record - the stats\nChristian Eriksen's goal for Spurs was the 1,067th Premier League goal this season, beating the total from any previous 38-game season in the competition.\nTottenham's run of four consecutive top-four finishes in the top-flight is their best run since a run of five between 1959-60 and 1963-64.\nEverton finish eighth for a second consecutive season, but their goal difference is 22 goals better this term.\nSpurs are unbeaten in their last 13 Premier League meetings with Everton, winning seven, with their last defeat coming in December 2012.\nExcluding penalties, Everton - with 16 - have conceded the most goals from set-pieces of any team in the Premier League this season.\nSince his Premier League debut in September 2013, Christian Eriksen has scored the most direct free-kicks, with seven, and most goals from outside the box, with 22.\nDier's opener for Spurs after two minutes and 49 seconds was the earliest goal conceded by Everton in the Premier League since November 2017.\nEverton's Theo Walcott has been directly involved in 10 goals against Spurs in the Premier League, his joint-most against a single opponent in the competition."

The tiny margins that decided an extraordinary battle\nManchester City fans celebrate Premier League win\nMan City stung into action\nCity knew their task at kick-off in Sussex - but whether it was a combination of nerves or unwitting complacency, it took the fright of going behind to kick them into action.\nCity were careless and lacking in urgency until Murray bundled in a near-post header.\nIt was the signal for the last assault on the title.\nAguero swiftly put the show back on the road and once Laporte escape the attentions of Murray to head home, this was job done.\nIt was a fitting decoration that the final two goals of City's season were thunderous efforts from Mahrez and Gundogan, demonstrating the quality that is spread so liberally through this squad.\nBrighton, to their credit, did not simply stand aside and allow the party to take place: Chris Hughton's side were organised and resilient but once they levelled matters up, City were irresistible.\nAnd even the home fans accepted the inevitable by the final whistle, rising to first give a standing ovation to City captain Vincent Kompany when he was substituted and then to Guardiola and his team once referee Michael Oliver had sounded the final whistle that confirmed they were were Premier League champions for the fourth time and for the sixth time in total.\nCity's achievement, completed with that astonishing 14-game win towards the winning post, is underscored by the fact they saw off a Liverpool side that lost just once this season - to City - and amassed 97 points.\nThis is a magnificent feat by Guardiola and Manchester City.\nThe best team always ends as Premier League champions - and no matter how superbly Liverpool have performed, they came up against a truly outstanding team that was just one point better.\nBrighton survive again\nThis was a day of celebration for Manchester City - and also one of satisfaction for Brighton as they look forward to another season in the Premier League.\nIt was a particularly special day for their iconic 38-year-old Spanish defender Bruno, who was making his final appearance. He was cheered throughout and made an emotional farewell when he was taken off.\nBruno, clearly loved down here, was also acclaimed during a post-match speech.\nThe Brighton fans left for summer in good heart after surviving late worries they may be hauled into the relegation fight and now shrewd manager Hughton will start plotting again to ensure they are in position for another season of consolidation when it all starts again in August.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\nCity's sixth top-flight title - the stats\nManchester City have won their fourth Premier League title - only Manchester United (13) and Chelsea (5) have ever won more in the competition.\nOverall, City have won their sixth English top-flight title. They're the first side to retain the title since Manchester United in 2008-09.\nThis was the eighth time the Premier League title has been decided on the final day of the season, with Manchester City winning it on three of those occasions (2011-12, 2013-14 and 2018-19).\nCity's haul of 98 points is the joint-second highest for any team in English top-flight history (converting to three points for a win) - only City themselves have ever earned more (100 in 2017-18).\nCity conceded the first goal in a Premier League game for the first time since their 2-0 defeat at Chelsea in December - they were behind for just 83 seconds before Sergio Aguero's equaliser.\nCity have won their last 14 Premier League games - only City themselves (18 in December 2017) have had a longer winning run in the competition.\nCity have won 32 Premier League games this season - equalling their own record in the competition from last season for most wins in a single campaign in the competition.\nSergio Aguero has scored 32 goals in all competitions for Man City this season - only in 2016-17 (33) has he scored more in a single campaign for City.\nCity's David Silva has provided 18 assists for Sergio Aguero in the Premier League - only three players have ever assisted another for more goals in the competition (Frank Lampard to Didier Drogba, Darren Anderton to Teddy Sheringham and Steve McManaman to Robbie Fowler).\nGlenn Murray has scored 36% of Brighton's overall Premier League goals (25/69), the highest proportion of any team's goals in the competition's history.\n'My toughest title to win' - reaction\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We have to say congratulations to Liverpool and thank you so much, they pushed us to increase our standards.\n\"It's incredible, 98 points, to go back-to-back. We made the standard higher last season and Liverpool helped us. To win this title we had to win 14 (league games) in a row. We couldn't lose one point.\n\"It's the toughest title we have won in all my career, by far.\"\nManchester City forward Raheem Sterling, speaking to Sky Sports: \"I'm just delighted, this is exactly what I came to the club for, to win trophies and be in these moments.\n\"The manager here... his mentality is the best. It's always about winning. It's the way he sets us up. I'm happy to be here learning and winning.\n\"As a manager, he's got multiple players in each position challenging each other. No one is comfortable here but everyone is ready to take their chance - like Riyad today. He's not played much recently but I knew he was going to score today.\n\"It's been a lovely season after a difficult World Cup. Hopefully I can go one better next year.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton, speaking to Sky Sports: \"The next step for us is to learn from the disappointment we had in periods this season.\n\"We need to score more goals, that's the biggest thing. There are really good parts of our game that we can hold on to, but goals are the most important thing.\"\nOn Bruno's retirement: \"Bruno's an exceptional individual. It's not just about him being a great captain. The way he looks after himself and gets in the shape he is, it's great dedication.\n\"He's a fantastic individual and a person. That's why he's held in such high esteem here.\""

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 5-3 Bournemouth: Michy Batshuayi scores twice in entertaining finale\nManager Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace's win over Bournemouth was an \"attacking party\" after his side ended the season with an eight-goal thriller at Selhurst Park.\nPalace scored three times in the opening 37 minutes but were pegged back to 3-2, increased their lead to 4-2 only for Bournemouth to score again, before settling the game with a fifth goal in the 80th minute.\nThere were 33 shots in total - 17 by Palace and 16 by the Cherries - and both sides could have scored more.\n\"It was a fantastic end to the season,\" said Hodgson.\n\"It is nice now that I am standing here on the right end of the result that we could offer that spectacle to our fans in the final game of the season.\n\"I thought at 3-0 we would have a relatively comfortable second half but that wasn't the case. It was an attacking party out there.\"\nMichy Batshuayi, playing for Palace for the final time before his loan spell from Chelsea ends, opened the scoring in the 24th minute, capitalising on slack Bournemouth defending to volley home from six yards.\nThe Belgian slid in to convert Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross from close range eight minutes later before a Wilfried Zaha shot was blocked by keeper Mark Travers and rebounded in off Bournemouth defender Jack Simpson for an own goal.\nJefferson Lerma then crashed a stunning 30-yard shot in off the post just before the break and Jordon Ibe drilled into the bottom corner via a slight deflection 10 minutes after half-time to give the visitors hope.\nPatrick van Aanholt restored a two-goal lead for Palace, only for Joshua King to bundle home at a 73rd-minute corner.\nHowever, with 10 minutes remaining Zaha set up Andros Townsend who swept home to make sure of the three points for the hosts.\nReaction to the final day of the Premier League season\nRelive Crystal Palace v Bournemouth as it happened\nPalace win typical final-day encounter\nWith the two sides having little to play for other than positions in lower mid-table, it was no surprise they served up typical final-day performances, full of attacking intent and occasionally poor defending.\nThere were 33 shots in total - 17 by Palace and 16 by Bournemouth - and both sides could have added to the eight goals that were scored.\nBatshuayi had only scored four goals in 12 games before Sunday's game since joining on loan in January, but he took advantage of defensive lapses to add another two goals to his total.\nHodgson has previously said that he is unsure whether Palace will be able to sign the Belgian permanently in the summer, and it will be interesting to see whether the two goals persuade the Londoners to seek a deal.\nBatshuayi's fellow forward Zaha was another who impressed. He did not find the net himself but fed Van Aanholt smartly for Palace's fourth and produced a fine surging run before setting up Townsend for the fifth.\nHe was given a standing ovation when substituted late on, and the home fans will hope it was not the final time they see the highly rated Ivorian in a Palace shirt.\nThe win means Palace end with their highest Premier League points total from a 38-game campaign and Zaha will surely be crucial if they are to improve on that next season.\nBournemouth's season summed up in 90 minutes\nCherries manager Eddie Howe felt the game was a \"summary of their season\".\nThere were fine moments such as Lerma's spectacular strike, plus their ability to consistently create chances and respond to going behind - but they struggled defensively and were repeatedly hurt by Palace's quick attacking players.\n\"We had a real low in the first half,\" Howe said. \"We didn't defend well, didn't react well to the first goal. We wobbled a little bit, maybe due to the inexperience in our team.\n\"We responded really well in the second half and could have scored more.\n\"We felt we could cut them open but unfortunately it was the same for their attacking play. They had pace on the counter-attack, something we struggled to handle.\"\nBournemouth end the season having scored 56 goals - a figure only exceeded by the elite top six teams - but they also conceded 70. Only the bottom two sides, Fulham and Huddersfield, had a worse defensive record.\nIt has also been a strange campaign for Howe's side, having taken 26 of their 45 points in their opening 18 games, and then struggling for much of the second half of the season.\nThey were eighth in the table in December but finish 14th, two places worse off than last year - although they finished only one point shy of their record top-flight points tally of 46 from 2016-17.\n\"It has to be seen as another season of progression,\" Howe said.\n\"We have been able to withstand injuries to key players and blood some young players.\n\"The team has been in transition throughout the seasons so to maintain our Premier League status and at times play good football, it has been pleasing.\"\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\nHodgson's century of wins - the best stats\nCrystal Palace have scored five goals in a Premier League game for only the third time, and the first time since winning 5-0 v Leicester in April 2018.\nBournemouth's Premier League matches this season have featured a total of 126 goals (56 scored, 70 conceded), the most of any side in the competition this season.\nRoy Hodgson enjoyed his 100th Premier League win, becoming the oldest manager to reach that milestone at 71 years and 276 days.\nPalace striker Michy Batshuayi has ended on the winning side in all nine Premier League games where he has scored, with only Chris Smalling netting in more games with a 100% win record (Daniel Agger also on nine).\nBatshuayi has scored twice in each of his two Premier League appearances on the final day of the season, scoring two for Chelsea in May 2017 and a brace in this game.\nAndros Townsend has hit double figures for goal involvements in a Premier League season for the first time (six goals, four assists)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 4-3 Leicester City\nSubstitute Olivier Giroud headed in a dramatic late winner as Arsenal fought back to beat Leicester City in a thrilling start to the 2017-18 Premier League season.\nThe Gunners trailed 3-2 with seven minutes to go before Aaron Ramsey and Giroud swung the game back in the home side's favour at a euphoric Emirates Stadium.\nAlexandre Lacazette headed the Gunners ahead 94 seconds into his top-flight debut, only for Shinji Okazaki to nod in an equaliser just two minutes later.\nVardy then slid the visitors ahead from Marc Albrighton's cross, before Danny Welbeck drew Arsenal level at the end of a pulsating opening half.\nLeicester took the lead again when Vardy headed in Riyad Mahrez's corner before Arsene Wenger made an inspired double substitution which sparked Arsenal's comeback.\nSubstitute Ramsey smashed in an angled drive - from a corner which was won after Mesut Ozil handled in the build-up - before Giroud showed athleticism and strength to meet Granit Xhaka's corner.\nListen: 5 live Football Daily - Arsenal get season off to a flier\nGiroud proves his worth after deciding to stay\nGiroud's days at Arsenal appeared to be numbered following the arrival of fellow France striker Lacazette from Lyon for a club-record \u00a346.5m fee.\nAnd Wenger revealed after Friday's win that Giroud, who has scored 97 goals in 231 appearances since joining from Montpellier in 2012, could have left the Gunners this summer.\n\"At one stage I opened the door for him as I knew I had many strikers, and in the end he decided to stay,\" said Wenger.\n\"He doesn't want to leave and I'm happy he wants to stay.\"\nThe 30-year-old wasted no time in proving his worth with another vital goal after coming on as a substitute.\nGiroud offers a different, more physical option for Wenger, but is hoping for a more substantial role at the club.\nSince the start of last season, he has scored seven Premier League goals when coming off the bench - three more than any other player in the same period.\n\"I prefer to be on the pitch as much as I can but I want to help the team reach the targets,\" he said.\nArsenal rally to avoid another opening defeat\nArsenal started the new Premier League season having won just one of their previous five opening matches - all of which were also home fixtures.\nIn the build-up to Friday's game Wenger repeatedly stressed the importance of beginning with a positive result against Leicester - and the Gunners appeared to have listened to their manager as they made the dream start.\nLacazette was perfectly placed to take advantage of Wes Morgan misjudging Mohamed Elneny's cross, flicking in a low header to become the fastest-scoring debutant in Premier League history.\nThe joy did not last long, however. Leicester exploited sloppiness by the Gunners to go ahead, leading to murmurings of discontent among the home crowd.\nArsenal's failure to finish in the top four of the Premier League for the first time in 20 years last season, not to mention the criticism Wenger has received from some sections of the Gunners support, meant the Frenchman could ill-afford to begin with a defeat.\nAnd the mood ebbed and flowed inside the Emirates - with some of the familiar grumblings of discontent evident.\nThe atmosphere turned dark among the home fans after Vardy's first, the audible frustration subsiding when Welbeck calmly rolled in Saed Kolasinac's cut-back, only to return again when Vardy restored the Foxes lead.\nWenger looked on anxiously from the dugout, eventually appearing on the touchline when he introduced Ramsey and Giroud after 67 minutes.\nWithin 20 minutes both players had scored - and the mood completely changed - as Arsenal avoided losing their opening fixture for the fourth time in five years.\nLeicester show glimpses of their title-winning form\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare talked in his pre-match interview about the Foxes knowing their counter-attacking strengths and trying to use them to good effect against Arsenal's \"fashionable\" back three.\nThat is exactly what they did.\nThe visitors found joy down the flanks, exposing the Gunners' familiar defensive failings through Vardy's sharp movement and quick balls forward.\nTheir rapid breaks were reminiscent of their title-winning side of two seasons ago, as was their clinical finishing: the Foxes scored with each of their three efforts on target.\nUnfortunately for the 2015-16 champions, it was their own lapses of concentration which could not keep Arsenal out at the other end.\nLed by captain Wes Morgan and new signing Harry Maguire, Leicester remained resolute in the second half until the pressure from Arsenal - who had 27 attempts at goal - eventually told.\n\"Scoring three goals away from home is a positive and we'll get back on the training field to make sure we sort the problems out,\" said Vardy, who turned down a move to the Gunners last summer.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nPost-match reaction\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"We know defensively we can do better but overall we produced a top-quality game.\n\"When the substitutes came on they had enough quality to make the difference.\n\"I'm convinced that overall this kind of game can strengthen the belief. When you're in difficult situations you're reminded you've done it before so can do it again.\"\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare:\n\"We spoke about being compact and being a threat with the pace of Vardy. We executed that well. We're disappointed to score three and come away with a defeat.\n\"When teams make substitutes just before corners it's confusing. I'm disappointed with the handball in the build up, but once the corner's given you have to defend it better. I don't know whether it was lack of concentration or game management.\nArsenal just love playing against Leicester...\nThis was only the sixth time that an opening game in a Premier League season has seen seven goals scored - no game has seen more\nArsenal are now unbeaten in 22 Premier League games against Leicester City - winning 15 and drawing seven - and they have won 11 successive Premier League home games against the Foxes\nAlexandre Lacazette scored with his first shot (and second touch) as a Premier League player\nThe last player to score a goal faster on their Premier League debut was Thievy Bifouma, who came on for his Premier League debut for West Brom at half-time and scored after just 36 seconds in a 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace in February 2014\nLacazette is just the seventh player to score on his Premier League debut for Arsenal, after Kevin Campbell, Steve Bould, Fredrik Ljungberg, Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri and Thomas Vermaelen.\nJamie Vardy has now scored five goals in his last five Premier League appearances against Arsenal\nWhat's next?\nThe rest of the opening Premier League weekend, of course...\nAfter that, Arsenal go to Stoke City - a place where they have struggled in recent years, winning just one of their past seven trips - on Saturday, 19 August (17:30 BST).\nLeicester return home as they welcome newly-promoted Brighton on the same day (15:00 BST)."

He needs to see it,\" said Klopp.\n\"I cannot change it. We would have had defensive areas we need to work on if we'd won 3-2. We were the better team, we should have won.\"\nWatford boss Marco Silva said he had not seen whether his side's equaliser was offside.\nBattling Watford show spirit under Silva\nSilva's side were minutes away from losing a seventh successive Premier League match before Britos had the final say in the former Hull City manager's first league game in charge of the Hornets.\nSeven of the side that started against Liverpool were part of the team that was crushed 5-0 at home to Manchester City on the final day of last season.\nYet the Hornets produced an encouraging performance under their new Portuguese boss which suggests they could finish higher up the table than last season's 17th-placed finish.\nMidfielder Nathaniel Chalobah was the only one of Silva's six summer signings to start - club record \u00a318.5m buy Andre Gray beginning life on the bench and coming on in the second half.\nMan of the Match - Roberto Firmino (Liverpool)\nPost-match reaction\nWatford manager Marco Silva said: \"I think it's a fair result. We had a very good first half, a good intensity like I wanted.\n\"I didn't like the first 25 minutes of the second half. We expected a good reaction from Liverpool but we needed to be better. We made mistakes. But we reacted well.\n\"Our fans pushed our players on. We had some small injuries. We need to show this attitude and commitment in all our games.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said: \"The first half I wasn't too happy with. We passed but couldn't see what we actually wanted.\n\"The second half was a lot better. We forgot to close the game. We defended a little deep. We have to push up. Both teams struggled with 90 minutes, it's the first game. That's normal.\"\nDefender and deadly goal provider... the stats\nNo defender has provided more assists in the Premier League since the start of last season than Jose Holebas (five).\nLiverpool's Sadio Mane has netted five goals in his past seven Premier League appearances.\nMane has scored with his first shot on target in the Premier League in both the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons.\nFirmino has both scored more and assisted more Premier League goals than any other Liverpool player since the start of 2015-16 (22 goals, 15 assists).\nSalah is the 12th different player to score on his Premier League debut for Liverpool.\nOnly Jose Fonte (five) has given away more penalties in the Premier League than Heurelho Gomes (four) since the start of 2015-16.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool will hope for a better defensive performance when they face Hoffenheim in Germany on Tuesday in a Champions League play-off (19:45 BST).

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-0 Swansea City\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino praised the \"quality and spirit\" of his side despite being held by Swansea City in the Argentine's first competitive match in charge of the Saints.\nThe wasteful hosts created the better opportunities in an entertaining stalemate but were denied by poor finishing and good goalkeeping as chance after chance was spurned, particularly in a one-sided first half.\nStriker Manolo Gabbiadini hit a post with a header after only 90 seconds, Dusan Tadic fired wide from four yards and Maya Yoshida failed to find the target with an acrobatic volley and a late close-range header, while Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski also denied James Ward-Prowse.\nSub Charlie Austin hit the side-netting with a chance deep in stoppage time.\nRelive Southampton's goalless draw with Swansea as it happened\nReaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League football\n\"We did everything to win the game but we couldn't,\" added ex-Alaves boss Pellegrino, who replaced the sacked Claude Puel in June. \"We controlled the ball, created chances but this is football - you have to get goals and we couldn't do so.\n\"Sometimes it is really difficult to score - we had 29 shots. We have quality and spirit in the team and it is best to keep going, keep training.\"\nThe Swans failed to have a shot on target and their best opportunities were spurned when Tammy Abraham headed wide after 10 minutes and Leroy Fer blasted a volley off target just after the interval.\nHowever, boss Paul Clement was pleased to have gained a hard-fought point.\n\"It was a hard afternoon, they had a massive amount of chances, set-play after set-play, and we suffered at times,\" added Clement.\n\"I'm happy we ended up with a point and it could have been a lot worse. The last-gasp defending was good but we didn't use the ball well enough further up the pitch.\n\"We are pleased we have got out of here with a draw. I'm sure they will be disappointed and think 'how have we not won'.\"\nPellegrino off to a slow start\nThe Saints have not won a home opener since 1988-89 and have been victorious only twice in 19 seasons of Premier League football on the opening day.\nFor the Saints, there is instant pressure on manager Pellegrino to not only consolidate at a club that finished eighth last season and reached a cup final, but to do so playing a more entertaining brand of football than his predecessor Puel.\nThe Premier League's third Argentine manager will be seeking to match his efforts last year in Spain, having led Alaves to ninth in La Liga and the Copa del Rey final.\nSouthampton have finished in the top eight of the Premier League in each of the last four seasons, but they did not score in their final five home league fixtures last season and only managed 17 home goals all term at home.\nHowever, there was no shortage on chances created by his side against Paul Clement's men, with Gabbiadini heading against the woodwork within 90 seconds and Tadic missing a sitter from close range after superb link-up play from Ryan Bertrand and Nathan Redmond.\nEven in failing to score, there was at least a sense with the Saints fans that they were seeing a keener commitment to attacking football and they might have won it at the end, had Yoshida not headed wide from close range.\nIn the absence of last season's top scorer Fernando Llorente, who has a broken arm, and Everton transfer target Gylfi Sigurdsson, the Swans were without their top two attacking talents and they struggled to create much at all.\nMain men missing\nFor both clubs, the contest was notable as much for who did not feature as for who did, with both sides forced to do without their star players.\nFor Southampton, there remains a degree of uncertainty about defender Virgil Van Dijk, who has made clear his intention to leave St Mary's despite Saints' insistence he is unavailable for transfer. The club said he missed the big match with a virus.\nAfter the match, Pellegrino said he hoped the Dutch centre-half still had a future at St Mary's.\n\"He is part of the squad. I can't talk about something that right now, I can't manage,\" said the Argentine. \"Hopefully we are waiting for him to train with the team and be part of the team again.\n\"It is good news that he was here, like all his teammates. You have to be here supporting them.\n\"I have talked with him twice and the club was clear with him. We repeat again the same thing. All of us know Virgil is an important part of the club.\"\nSwansea expect key performer Gylfi Sigurdsson to complete his protracted move to Everton sooner rather than later, with the Iceland international having largely made himself unavailable for pre-season.\n\"There is a difference of opinion on the valuation of the player, but I don't think it is far off,\" said Clement, with Everton unwilling to pay the \u00a350m asking price for the player.\nThe absence of the \u00a3100m rated-pair has cast a large shadow over both clubs this summer and, as was the case at St Mary's, both managers must probably learn to do without their star men going forward. Swansea, especially, are clearly going to miss their attacking talisman.\nSwans likely to be in battle at bottom again?\nSwansea, of the two sides, will probably feel they have the most work to do in order to avoid a season of struggle after their remarkable escape from relegation last season.\nMuch of their hope will rest on young shoulders, with two players with an outside chance of forcing themselves into England World Cup contention likely to be pivotal.\nCentral defender Alfie Mawson started the season as he finished the last, in superb form, while on-loan Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham will reflect on what might have been.\nHe headed wide with Swansea's best opportunity and will need more consistent service if he is to match his tally of 27 goals for Bristol City in the Championship last term. A partnership between him and Llorente will tantalise Swans fans.\nHowever, the Swans will be content with how they defended in their opening encounter, having absorbed large spells of pressure, but they have now failed to score in seven of their 11 meetings with the Saints in the Premier League.\nMan of the match: Oriol Romeu (Southampton)\nSaints fail to score at home - again\nNone of the last six Southampton managers have won their first Premier League game in charge (including Mauricio Pellegrino).\nSouthampton have never won an opening-day home fixture in the Premier League (drawn six, lost four).\nSwansea are unbeaten in their last four Premier League season openers (won two, drawn two).\nSeven of Southampton's last nine Premier League games have been goalless at half-time.\nIndeed, Saints have now drawn a blank in six of their last seven top-flight matches.\nSwansea failed to land a single shot on target, while the hosts Southampton fired in just two despite attempting 29 shots in total (including blocks).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton have another home game as their match against West Ham on Saturday, 19 August (15:00 BST) will be played at St Mary's as the Hammers' London Stadium is unavailable following the end of the World Athletics Championships. Swansea entertain Manchester United in the early kick-off next Saturday (12:30 BST).\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-0 Stoke: Special moment to score winner, says Wayne Rooney\nWayne Rooney says it was a \"special moment\" to score the winning goal on his top-flight return to Everton after 13 years and one he has been looking forward to for a long time.\nThe 31-year-old, who left the club for Manchester United in 2004, headed in his 199th Premier League goal as the Toffees beat Stoke 1-0 at Goodison Park.\nRooney said a lot of \"relief and emotion\" came out as he celebrated what proved to be the decider before half-time.\n\"On a personal note, I'm absolutely delighted to score the winning goal at Goodison Park,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"It was a special moment for me. There was a lot of relief and a lot of emotion. It was an important goal just before half-time.\n\"I've felt at home since I first stepped in the training ground. I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time.\"\nRooney found space in the area to head a Dominic Calvert-Lewin cross past Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland in what was the Toffees' best move of the match - one the former England captain was twice involved in before adding the finishing touch.\nCalvert-Lewin also went close for the home side as Stoke struggled to break Everton down on the opening day.\nXherdan Shaqiri's long-range effort did force new Toffees goalkeeper Jordan Pickford into a fine save in stoppage-time, with the 23-year-old leaping across his line to tip wide.\nFollow the reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action from Goodison Park\nRooney's perfect homecoming\nRooney scored the first of his Premier League goals for Everton with a sublime strike against Arsenal as a 16-year-old in 2002. His 199th in the English top flight 15 years later wasn't quite as dramatic, but it will have meant just as much to the boyhood Blues fan.\nSir Alex Ferguson moved to snap up the teenager after some flashes of genius in an Everton shirt and Rooney returned to Goodison Park as England and Manchester United's all-time leading goalscorer.\nHe helped start the move that resulted in the winning goal with some neat link-up play with Idrissa Gueye and Sandro Ramirez, before showing all that experience to peel away in the area and guide a free header into the opposite corner.\nThe forward started tenaciously and could have found himself in the book for a late tackle on former United team-mate Darren Fletcher, but Rooney's desire to track back and help his side defensively also proved invaluable against a direct Stoke threat.\nThis season could go a long way to deciding his legacy among the Everton faithful, but the former England captain will also be hoping to play his way back into Gareth Southgate's plans with a World Cup looming next summer.\nThe winning goal on his Goodison Park homecoming proved a perfect start.\nHow did the new signings fare?\nEverton have spent the best part of \u00a3100m this summer, with a club record \u00a350m move for Swansea playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson potentially still to come before the deadline.\nPickford's late save from a Shaqiri effort that looked to be heading for the top corner will have helped prove his worth as the most expensive British goalkeeper, and the \u00a330m man also instilled confidence in his back three with his commanding presence around the Everton box.\nThe England Under-21 international was, alongside Rooney, the standout among five new arrivals who started for Ronald Koeman's side.\nStoke, meanwhile, have done most of their business on the cheap.\nKurt Zouma looks a solid acquisition for Mark Hughes' side and the on-loan Chelsea defender stopped Calvert-Lewin doubling the hosts' lead with a superb block in the second half.\nThe Potters snapped up Scotland international Fletcher from West Brom, and the 33-year-old central midfielder made more passes (45) than any other play on his side while also firing narrowly wide from distance.\nMan of the match - Idrissa Gueye (Everton)\n'Wayne is one of the best in his position'\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman said: \"The points are really welcome because you don't know what to expect on the first day. It wasn't the performance we like. The team looked nervous on the ball - that's the reason I changed the system at half-time. We need to improve a lot.\"\nOn Wayne Rooney scoring the winner: \"Wayne showed he is still one of the best in his position. He was very comfortable on the ball and made good decisions on the ball and scored a great goal.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes said: \"The story is all about him [Rooney] because he has won the game for Everton. The one man you don't want in those situations is Wayne.\n\"I'm disappointed with the result but not the performance.\"\nOn Jordan Pickford's late save to deny Xherdan Shaqiri an equaliser: \"It was fantastic. Obviously Everton have invested a lot of money in their side. There didn't seem a great deal of difference between the two sides.\"\nThe stats - 4,869 days between goals\nRooney set a new Premier League record for the longest gap between two appearances for the same team (4,837 days).\nRooney also set a new Premier League record for the longest gap between goals for the same club (4,869 days).\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals on the opening day than Rooney (eight - level with Alan Shearer and Frank Lampard).\nRooney's effort was his 300th goal involvement in the Premier League (199 goals, 101 assists), only Alan Shearer (324) has more.\nMark Hughes hasn't won any of his past seven opening day Premier League games (D2, L5) in charge of three different clubs in that time (Fulham, QPR and Stoke).\nThe Potters have failed to score in seven of their past nine away games in the Premier League.\nWhat next?\nEverton host Hajduk Split in the Europa League qualifying play-offs first leg on Thursday (20:05 BST), before visiting Manchester City on Monday, 21 August (20:00).\nStoke play Arsenal in the Premier League next Saturday (17:30), before welcoming Rochdale in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, 22 August (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-3 Burnley\nChampions Chelsea suffered a nightmare start to their Premier League title defence, having two men sent off as Burnley claimed a superb win at Stamford Bridge.\nIt would be easy but misleading to lay the blame for the Blues' defeat on the decision to show a red card to new club captain Gary Cahill for a lunging tackle on Steven Defour midway through the first half.\nBut that would deprive Burnley their due for a disciplined, energetic and ruthless first-half display that saw them score three times, with Sam Vokes netting twice - a header and a volley - either side of a lashing angled drive from Stephen Ward.\nThe Blues were better after the break and pulled a goal back when summer signing Alvaro Morata headed in shortly after coming off the bench.\nHowever, the Spaniard was also at fault for denying the home side a second goal, adding an unnecessary touch to Andreas Christiansen's goal-bound shot from an offside position.\nChelsea's hopes looked to have gone when a late challenge from Cesc Fabregas on Jack Cork added a second yellow to his first, received for dissent, to leave the Blues with nine men.\nBut David Luiz fired home from inside the box after being set up by a Morata header to set up a frantic final few minutes, during which Burnley struck the post through Robbie Brady before holding on to take the three points.\nRelive Chelsea 2-3 Burnley as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League fixtures\nCostly day for Conte and Chelsea\nIt has been a difficult summer for Chelsea and their boss Antonio Conte, who has openly voiced his frustration at the club's failure to recruit his desired targets - both in terms of quality and quantity.\nThis game felt like the culmination of such issues and could well be the breaking point that leads to further significant moves in the transfer market.\nAttacking midfielder Jeremie Boga is undoubtedly talented but his inclusion - along with a a bench populated largely by inexperienced young players - also felt like a point being made about the resources the Italian has available.\nThere was no Diego Costa (on his way out), no Eden Hazard or Pedro (injured) and, after 24 minutes, no Cahill, exposing the decisions to let Nathan Ake join Bournemouth and fellow defender Kurt Zouma go on loan to Stoke.\nCahill's red card ended Boga's shock debut early, as he was replaced by Christensen, and handed the initiative to Burnley, whose three-goal salvo added disbelief to the list of negative emotions ripping through the home support.\nOn the plus side for the Blues, Morata adapted quickly to life in the Premier League, showing an intelligence of movement and eagerness, even if this did lead him to deny his side a goal.\nBut Conte has plenty of thinking to do. This was the Blues' first opening-day league defeat since 1998 and they have now had four men sent off in their last three competitive games, dating back to last season's FA Cup final.\nAn away day to remember\nThere was no doubt about the secret behind Burnley's Premier League survival last season - their form at Turf Moor.\nSean Dyche's team had the ninth-best record in the top division - picking up 33 points at home.\nIn contrast, they mustered just seven away from home - and just one between the start of the season and the end of February, with a goalless draw at Manchester United on 29 October.\nThey didn't win away from Turf Moor until a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace on 29 April - and so the achievement of their opening-day victory at the current champions should not be underestimated.\nIf Burnley can regularly pick up points on their travels while maintaining the sort of form they showed at home, then it bodes well for their prospects this season.\nWith performances like this, they will do just that.\nLike their opponents, they have met with frustration in their attempts to recruit players, but Cork is an astute signing, bringing a steadying influence to midfield.\nResolute defensive displays from James Tarkowski and Ben Mee and a clinical attacking showing from Vokes suggest that Dyche may not have to go shopping to replace Michael Keane or find the requisite attacking edge.\n'This quietens a few stories' - post-match reaction\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"We are learning and building an assured view of the Premier League. But today big decisions changed the outcome, quite obviously. The first half pleased me because although Chelsea went to 10 men, it was not easy. We kept going, kept probing and it's 3-0 at the interval.\n\"Winning away from home on the first day quietens down some stories - we're written off at the start of every season. It kills off a few things early doors and it allows the players that space for growth.\n\"Chelsea have players of such calibre and to see the game through is so pleasing.\"\nBurnley goalscorer Sam Vokes: \"We were sloppy at times but we ground out the result and we're delighted.\n\"That's a huge result - a lot was made of our away form last season. It was always going to be tough here but we got our heads down and put in a performance.\"\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"The sending off of Cahill was a key moment, because to play the rest of the game with 10 and then nine men is not easy. I don't want to comment on the referee, absolutely not.\n\"We tried until the end to reach a good result against Burnley - it was a pity because our fight in the second half was very good. But in our first half, we kept losing our heads. After the red card we lost our heads, conceded three goals and then it's very difficult to change the final result.\n\"Morata is very important and it's important that he now adapts himself to our philosophy - today he played a good game with the right intensity. Now he has to continue to work with all the rest of our players.\"\nChelsea follow Leicester's lead - the stats you need to know\nChelsea are only the second reigning Premier League champions to lose the opening game of the following campaign (also Leicester last season).\nBurnley registered their first opening-day victory in the Premier League, after losing each of the previous three.\nChelsea are the first reigning Premier League champions to concede three goals in the opening game of the next season.\nChelsea picked up their first red card in the Premier League in 41 games, since John Terry was dismissed against Sunderland (May 2016).\nChelsea are the first side to pick up two red cards on the opening day of a Premier League season.\nThe Blues had two players sent off in a game for the seventh time in the Premier League and the first since March 2014 (against Aston Villa).\nSam Vokes is the first player to score in four consecutive Premier League appearances for the Clarets.\nAlvaro Morata is the 21st player to score on his Chelsea Premier League debut, and the first since Alexandre Pato in April 2016 (v Aston Villa).\nThis is the first time that the reigning champions have suffered a defeat on the first matchday in successive top-flight seasons since 1968 (Man Utd 1967-68 & Man City 1968-69).\nWhat next?\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte would doubtless want to see some new faces arrive at the club as a matter of urgency - but the next fixture for his team is a tough-looking trip to London rivals Tottenham on 20 August.\nBurnley welcome West Brom to Turf Moor a day earlier."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-3 Huddersfield Town\nHuddersfield Town made a dream start to their debut season in the Premier League as new Crystal Palace boss Frank de Boer endured a miserable first game.\nThe Terriers, playing in the English top flight for the first time since 1972, led when Mathias Jorgensen's header flew in off Palace's Joel Ward.\nBacked by almost 3,000 away fans, the Yorkshire side doubled their advantage when Steve Mounie powerfully nodded in.\nPalace's Scott Dann blazed over, just before Mounie cracked in the third.\nAnd the impressive victory against a poor Palace side puts the Terriers on top of the fledgling table after their opening game.\nDavid Wagner's side celebrated their first Premier League win with joyous celebrations, the players standing in a line and linking arms in front of their travelling supporters, who cheered loudly every time their heroes raised their hands in the air.\nFollow all the post-match reaction from today's Premier League games\nRelive Huddersfield's historic win\nA day to remember for Huddersfield\nHuddersfield upset the odds to reach the Premier League last season, combining indomitable team spirit and an aggressive pressing game to go up through the play-offs.\nThe Terriers have been tipped by many to go straight back down to the Championship, like the three previous play-off winners before them.\nOf the starting XI which started at Selhurst Park, only one player - former Palace loanee Tom Ince - had previous Premier League experience, but they were not overawed by the one of the biggest occasions in Town's recent history.\nWhatever happens over the course of the rest of this season, this will be a day that Terriers fans remember for the rest of their lives.\nGerman boss Wagner, the close friend of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp who masterminded promotion in his debut season in English football, instructed his side to be aggressive against Palace - and it worked.\nInce should have put the visitors ahead even before Ward bundled into his own net when Jorgensen beat a static Palace defence to Aaron Mooy's deep cross to the far post.\nMooy, who made his loan spell from Manchester City permanent after an \u00a38m summer move, also provided Town's second, Mounie climbing highest to powerfully head into the left corner.\nMounie, 22, eclipsed Mooy as Huddersfield's record signing when he arrived from French side Montpellier a few days later and showed why the West Yorkshire club were willing to pay \u00a312m for him.\nThe Benin international impressed with his tireless workrate in the lone striker's role, but showed he has plenty of ability as well as desire with another clinical finish to seal victory.\nHowever, he was denied a hat-trick when Palace debutant Timothy Fosu-Mensah's superb sliding tackle stopped him going clean through.\n\"A debut like this, scoring two goals and winning in our first Premier League game is amazing,\" he said.\nA day to forget for Palace and De Boer\nWhile it was a memorable Premier League debut for Huddersfield and their boss Wagner, Palace and De Boer will hoping to quickly move on from this one.\nDe Boer, who has previously managed Ajax and Inter Milan, arrived in the summer to replace Sam Allardyce, who left after helping Palace avoid relegation last season.\nThe 47-year-old Dutchman has promised a more possession-based, high-pressing game at Selhurst Park - like the one he played at Ajax and Barcelona under the tutelage of compatriot Louis van Gaal.\nBut first he must address the defensive vulnerability which his side showed throughout.\nDe Boer is a firm advocate of playing three centre-backs, but he will be concerned about the ease with which his defence was easily bypassed by quick balls into the area.\nThere were signs of attacking promise after the break and if centre-back Dann, who scored four goals last season, had buried a loose ball in the box rather than firing over then the outcome might have been different.\nInstead, Huddersfield scored seconds later as Palace failed to deal with another positive ball forward.\n\"Tactically, we did not do what we spoke about and paid an expensive price,\" said former Netherlands defender De Boer, whose side were booed off at half-time.\n\"We were not pressing up top and they were allowed to get crosses too. We did not make the right choices and got punished.\"\nMan of the match - Steve Mounie (Huddersfield Town)\nPost-match reaction\nCrystal Palace manager Frank de Boer:\n\"If you analyse the game, it is quite simple. We started well but after 10 minutes the game changed. We were close to making it 2-1 and if we did, I had a feeling we would get a point.\n\"You cannot go suddenly from one to 10, you have to do it step-by-step. We showed some good football but a game does not last 75 minutes, you have to concentrate for 95 minutes.\n\"Huddersfield did a fantastic job and compliments to them. They played how they always do, but if you lose 3-0, they deserve it.\"\nHuddersfield Town manager David Wagner:\n\"We came into the game quite well. Tom Ince missed a chance but we were clinical and had the right fight, attitude and togetherness. The result does not show how the game was because Palace had their chances too.\n\"Steve Mounie missed a big chance, we spoke about this rather than the two goals. He played well, coming into the Premier League with two goals, there is no better day for him.\"\nPalace's opening-day woes continue....\nPalace have won only one of their last six opening day matches in the Premier League, losing four of the last five\nHuddersfield are the first team to win on their Premier League debut since Blackpool in August 2010\nThe Terriers are just the fifth newly-promoted side to win on the opening day of the Premier League since 2008-09, after West Ham (2012), Blackpool (2010) and Hull (2008 and 2016)\nFrank de Boer has enjoyed just one win in his last eight league games as a manager\nOnly one of the eight Dutchmen to manage in the Premier League has won in their first game in the competition - Guus Hiddink\nHuddersfield are the first side to see their first Premier League goal come through an own-goal\nWhat's next?\nAnother huge occasion for Huddersfield when they host their first Premier League game. Newcastle United, one of the other newly promoted sides, visit the John Smith's Stadium on Sunday, 20 August (13:30 BST).\nPalace hope to bounce back when they travel to Liverpool on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Bournemouth\nAhmed Hegazi described scoring on his Premier League debut as \"a fantastic feeling\" as he helped West Brom beat Bournemouth in a tepid encounter at The Hawthorns.\nBournemouth had the majority of possession but failed to capitalise, and there was a sense of inevitability as a Baggies free-kick was safely nodded in by the Egyptian defender.\nThe Cherries had only one effort on target and that came in the final moments of the game as Nathan Ake headed a corner tamely into Ben Foster's arms.\nTony Pulis' summer signings performed well, with another debutant Jay Rodriguez twice coming close, and it was a tidy opening day performance for the Baggies.\n\"It is a very important thing that the team is winning,\" added Hegazi. \"I know before, we had fantastic defenders in our team and we tried to do more.\"\nFollow all the reaction from Saturday's Premier League matches\nBaggies' new boys perform well on debut\nWest Brom rounded off their home campaign last season with four 1-0 defeats - but Pulis' summer acquisitions gave his side the edge over Bournemouth, where he began his managerial career 25 years ago.\nStriker Rodriguez, who joined from Southampton for \u00a312m, set the tempo from the off and was well supported by Hegazi, who nearly added a second goal with an attempt from the edge of the box.\nPrior to arriving at West Brom, the centre-back had struggled with injury, but he put that behind him with a strong showing, twice beating Joshua King for pace as the Cherries attempted to defend set-pieces.\nThe main concern for Pulis will be his side's finishing. Rodriguez frequently found himself in good positions but curled consecutive attempts wide, and Chris Brunt sliced an effort across goal, despite being handed plenty of space by Bournemouth.\n\"How we never scored more than one, I just don't know. We had the most shots on goal and the most corners,\" Pulis reflected.\n\"But we need to get some players in, and quickly. They have to be players that will improve us and we have to work hard over the next two weeks.\"\nWhen Bournemouth did attack, West Brom did what they have done best over the past few seasons - defending stoutly to frustrate their opponents and keep themselves in front.\nDeja vu for Bournemouth\nThere was a sense of inevitability about West Brom's strike - having scored 49% of their goals last season from set-pieces, they continued that run with the aid of some poor Bournemouth defending.\nThe Cherries looked unsure from the opening moments, struggling to deal with two early Albion throws, and five Cherries shirts were rooted to the spot as Hegazi rounded them and nodded the ball beyond Asmir Begovic.\nBournemouth have now conceded goals from set-pieces on three successive visits to The Hawthorns, and only West Brom's poor finishing prevented a heavier defeat, with Rodriguez twice curling the ball beyond the near post.\nThe visitors' defensive frailties could have been worse had it not been for keeper Begovic - making his second Cherries debut after a loan spell in 2007 - who moved sharply throughout the match, getting down low to block a close-range Rodriguez shot and parrying Salomon Rondon's attempt from distance in stoppage time.\nBournemouth ended the match with two-thirds of the possession but only that one shot on target - a hint of the work that manager Eddie Howe has in front of him this season.\n\"It is unlike us to have so much possession and to not create chances is the most disappointing thing,\" Howe said. \"We controlled the game but we have to be a lot more efficient with the possession.\"\nMan of the match - Jay Rodriguez (West Brom)\nCherries' opening day struggles continue - the stats you need to know\nWest Brom have won successive opening league fixtures for the first time since 1992.\nBournemouth have lost all three of their opening day fixtures in the Premier League, going down 1-0 to Aston Villa in 2015, 3-1 to Manchester United last year and now WBA.\nThe Baggies had 28.8% possession - the 15th occasion they have had less than 30% possession in a Premier League game under Pulis. Of those 15, they have won six.\nAlbion's Rekeem Harper is only the second player born this century (8 March 2000) to play in the Premier League, after Manchester United's Angel Gomes on the final day of the 2016-17 season.\nChris Brunt has provided 14 assists direct from dead-ball scenarios in the Premier League since August 2014, more than any other player during this period.\nAhmed Hegazi is the first West Brom player to score on his Premier League debut since loanee Thievy in February 2014.\nWith Hegazi's goal added to Mohamed Salah's strike for Liverpool earlier in the day, it was the first time that two Egyptians have scored on the same day in the Premier League since 1 November 2008 (Mido and Amr Zaki).\n'This season is a fresh start' - what they said\nWest Brom forward Jay Rodriguez: \"It is a fresh start and I love football, and to be given the opportunity to play is brilliant. I was dying to score. The main thing is to get the three points for the team.\n\"We are a tight-knit squad and the lads made me feel welcome as soon as I came in. We want to win games and push up the table.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"The build-up to the goal was very disappointing - we gave away a needless free-kick, and against West Brom that is a dangerous thing.\n\"We have had enough football in pre-season to be ready, and I thought we were ready. The pitch was slow, and that is not an excuse. All our substitutes came on and gave us a bounce effect.\n\"We had our best spell towards the end of the game. I expected us to have the possession that we did but I thought we would have been more creative with it.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Brom travel to Burnley on Saturday, 19 August, while Bournemouth host Watford at Vitality Stadium on the same day.\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 0-2 Manchester City\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was relieved to see his side overcome promoted Brighton after their Premier League rivals slipped up earlier in the day.\nTitle favourites City had to wait to break down the Seagulls before two late goals gave them victory on the south coast.\nBut they never looked in serious danger of suffering an opening weekend upset in the manner of Chelsea, who lost at home to Burnley, or Liverpool, who were held by Watford.\n\"The first game is always complicated, in my experience, even with Barcelona - especially against a promoted side when they have the passion and are under no pressure at all,\" said the former Barca and Bayern Munich boss.\n\"We saw what happened to Liverpool and Chelsea and we spoke about it. It was unexpected but this is the Premier League - I learned this last season.\n\"Here every game is a battle, but we controlled the game and it was always in our hands.\"\nThe Seagulls, back in the top flight after a 34-year absence, had showed impressive organisation and resolve to keep City at bay until David Silva played in Sergio Aguero to fire home after 70 minutes.\nLewis Dunk headed Fernandinho's cross into his own net five minutes later to make sure of the points for Guardiola's new-look side.\nBrighton, who had 22% possession, spent most of the game defending in their own half but had chances with the score at 0-0.\nShane Duffy had a shot deflected just wide and, after City's new \u00a335m goalkeeper Ederson flapped at the resulting corner, Dunk had two shots blocked in quick succession.\nBut that was the only time City's defence was under pressure and the day was more of a test of whether Guardiola's rebooted team could break down a massed defence.\nThey did not do it enough in his first season at City but at the Amex Stadium, eventually, they found a way through.\nReaction & analysis to Manchester City's victory over Brighton\nCity not making most of new width\nNew personnel meant a change to a 3-1-4-2 formation for Guardiola, something he tried during his side's recent tour of the United States.\nIt was hard to gauge an accurate impression of City's new shape because Brighton sat so deep in their own half and saw so little of the ball.\nEven so, the signs are that City are still adjusting to it themselves.\nKyle Walker and Danilo, signed for a combined \u00a368m over the summer, did exactly what they were supposed to do as wing-backs - constantly getting forward and overlapping down the outside.\nAll too often, though, their runs were ignored and City played the ball inside, where space was limited, before attacks broke down.\nWidth was the way forward for City, however, and moves along the right flank provided both their goals.\nDale Stephens' mistake allowed Walker to start the attack that led to Aguero scoring, while Fernandinho provided the cross that Dunk put into his own net.\nCautious Brighton unable to shine\nA rousing atmosphere greeted the Brighton players at a packed stadium but Chris Hughton's side, which included five new signings, had little opportunity to show what they could do.\nIt was just their discipline and work-rate on show for the first hour or so, when they often had 10 men behind the ball.\nUp front, Tomer Hemed and Pascal Gross had a thankless task of chasing and harrying, without a sight of goal.\nThat second-half spell, when City wobbled but held out under pressure, brought an amazing response from the home fans and perhaps demonstrated what might have been possible had Brighton showed more ambition on their big day against a side playing a new system.\nChris Hughton's cautious approach came within 20 minutes of earning a point against a team with much greater talent and resources but could not quite get the job done - in the end, it was City who did that.\n\"For 70 minutes we played the game we had to play when you are up against the quality they have got,\" said Hughton.\n\"City have got designs on winning the Champions League - our target is to make sure we are in this division next season.\n\"For 70 minutes, we kept them to minimal good chances but probably the first moment we allowed ourselves to get really stretched as a team, they capitalised.\"\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Man City)\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have won each of their last seven opening day contests in the Premier League, the best current run in the competition.\nBrighton have won just one of their last six opening league fixtures (D1 L4).\nSergio Aguero has hit six goals in his seven opening day Premier League games.\nLewis Dunk is the seventh player to score an own-goal on his Premier League debut.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2010, David Silva has provided 65 assists in the competition, 14 more than any other player (Wayne Rooney is next on 51).\nBrighton & Hove Albion have scored just one goal in total in their last four league games.\nGoalkeeper Mat Ryan attempted more passes than any outfield Brighton player in this match (27).\nManchester City have failed to find the net in just one of their last 12 Premier League games, netting 29 in total in that run.\n'We were stable but must improve' - what the managers said\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola: \"We had chances in the first minutes. We have controlled the counter-attacks and we didn't concede one chance. We are going to improve the way we attack.\n\"I was very happy with the new players. I want to say thank you to the club. We have huge players with lots of talent. Big congratulations to all the people in Manchester City - we are a strong club.\n\"I want to continue with what we did in the last three games of pre-season. We were stable but we have to try to improve. The most important thing was to win the first game.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"It is disappointing but that is the quality Manchester City have got and we know that.\n\"We can take a lot of positives from the game. When you are playing Champions League-quality teams, you know that they can hurt you. It was always going to be difficult for us to score.\n\"We have to make sure that come the end of the window, we have a squad that can do well enough in this division. We have to win the games that we can do.\n\"The fans have been absolutely brilliant in my time here and I think they are realistic. They will certainly be behind us.

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham made a winning start to the 2017-18 Premier League season as 10-man Newcastle endured a difficult return to the top flight.\nThe Magpies, promoted as winners of the Championship last term, had captain Jonjo Shelvey sent off early in the second half for standing on Dele Alli.\nThe Spurs attacker then put his side ahead with a close-range finish before Ben Davies finished off a neat move for Tottenham's second.\nIt was a harsh re-introduction to life back in the Premier League for Newcastle, who were relegated from the division at the end of the 2015-16 season.\nRafael Benitez's side did not really threaten Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal until late on, Christian Atsu forcing the goalkeeper into a low save and Ciaran Clark going close with a volley from 12 yards.\nInstead, Spurs could have added to their lead as Harry Kane, last season's Premier League top scorer with 29 goals, struck the post in injury time.\nRelive Tottenham's win at Newcastle\nIf it ain't broke, don't fix it?\nTottenham are the only Premier League side yet to make any signings this summer and the lack of transfer activity has frustrated some fans, especially after the sale of right-back Kyle Walker to Manchester City for \u00a345m.\nMauricio Pochettino's team were runners-up to an imperious Chelsea side last season but finished the campaign strongly, winning 12 and losing one of their final 13 league games.\nIt could therefore be argued that the adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' suits Spurs. Alli and Christian Eriksen combined to score or assist 48 goals for Tottenham in 2016-17 and it was little surprise both were involved in the opener, Eriksen setting up his team-mate to finish at the back post.\nPochettino also boasts an excellent record of promoting players from the club's academy at the correct time. Walker's place at right-back was filled by 20-year-old youth product Kyle Walker-Peters, a World Cup winner with England Under-20s over the summer, and the youngster put in a man-of-the-match display with some strong runs and crosses.\nHowever, West Ham winger Michail Antonio, speaking on MOTD2 Extra before Sunday's game, believes Spurs will need to strengthen in the transfer market to maintain their momentum.\n\"Bringing in players to challenge the ones who are there makes sure those who are in the positions already are not comfortable,\" he said.\n\"You can basically pick nine of Tottenham's players before a game.\"\nShelvey dismissal the turning point\nNewcastle, while lacking bite, were good value for a point until Shelvey's sending off.\nThe 25-year-old, who was banned for five games last season after being found guilty of making racist comments towards Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss, stood on Alli's ankle in the 49th minute. Just 12 minutes later Spurs took the lead.\nShelvey's dismissal means Newcastle will now be without the influential midfielder for their next three games - against Huddersfield and West Ham in the Premier League and Nottingham Forest in the EFL Cup.\nNewcastle midfielder Christian Atsu revealed after the game that Shelvey had apologised to his team-mates.\n\"That's football - mistakes do happen,\" Atsu told Sky Sports. \"He'll learn from his mistakes.\n\"He's upset with himself. He thinks he let the team down. We are really behind him. We believe he will come back stronger. He apologised to everyone.\"\nAlli, meanwhile, said \"there was no need\" for Shelvey to react as he did.\n\"I'm sure he'll be disappointed,\" said the Tottenham attacker. \"It was important we stayed professional. I don't want to talk about it too much.\n\"I've been pulled up for my temper before but today we had to keep our cool. There was no need to react today.\"\nToon troubles highlight the need to strengthen\nOf the three teams promoted to the Premier League - Newcastle, Brighton and Huddersfield - Rafael Benitez's side are the ones who have been backed by many as the most likely to flourish.\nHowever, Benitez has been frustrated in his efforts to build a squad capable of doing just that.\nNewcastle brought in five players over the summer, defenders Florian Lejeune and Javier Manquillo and midfielders Mikel Merino, Atsu and Jacob Murphy, but the club missed out on some of Benitez's targets.\nSunday's match highlighted their need to strengthen in one area in particular - attack. The last time Newcastle hosted Tottenham, in May last year, the Magpies ran out 5-1 winners but there was never any danger of a repeat of that scoreline.\nThe hosts managed just one shot on target in more than an hour before finishing with a flourish but by then Tottenham were 2-0 up and had slowed down the tempo of their own attacks.\nShevley's dismissal, coupled with the first-half departure of defenders Paul Dummett and Lejeune to injury, will only strengthen Benitez's desire to add to his squad before the end of the month.\nMan of the match - Kyle Walker-Peters\nWhat the said\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez to BBC Sport: \"It was difficult from the beginning. We had to adapt things [after injuries]. The red card changed everything. I think we were defending well. We have to improve. We had our chances but we missed them.\"\nHe thought Harry Kane's foul on Florian Lejeune, which resulted in a yellow card and an injury, was worse than Jonjo Shelvey's stamp on Dele Alli, for which he was sent off.\n\"The Harry Kane tackle was worse than this one. It's more dangerous. We lost one player from that. We made a mistake, but I think maybe someone has to analyse these things to see what's more dangerous.\"\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino to BBC Sport: \"We knew how they play, so narrow and deep. It was difficult to move the ball quickly. We had control and we were helped by the red card but I think we deserved to win the game.\n\"It was not easy to find the space and create chances. It's important to improve. In a stadium that doesn't have good memories for us, it was important to win. It was a clear red card.\n\"If Harry Kane had scored to make it 3-0 at the end, that would have been a bit more fair.\"\nPutting promoted sides to the sword - the stats\nTottenham have won 29 of their last 31 Premier League games against newly-promoted sides, drawing the other two.\nDele Alli has scored 13 Premier League goals in 2017; among English players, only Harry Kane (21) has scored more.\nShelvey has been sent off twice under Rafael Benitez at Newcastle, more than any other player. He was also red carded in a Championship match at Nottingham Forest in December 2016.\nSince the start of the 2015-16 season, Christian Eriksen has assisted more Premier League goals than any other player (30).\nFlorian Lejeune became the 200th French player to feature in the Premier League and also the 27th to represent Newcastle, more than any other side in the competition's history.\nSpurs have now won 13 of their past 14 Premier League games (L1), winning each of their past four, scoring 17 goals in the process.\nBen Davies has scored twice in his past two Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 102 combined.\nNone of the past 10 winners of the Championship have won their opening match in the Premier League the following season (D2 L8).\nThis was Rafael Benitez's first home Premier League defeat against Spurs, having won five and drawn three of his previous eight matches on home soil against them.\nWhat next?\nNewcastle were promoted with Huddersfield from the Championship last season and the two sides meet at the Terriers' John Smith's Stadium on Saturday (13:30 BST).\nTottenham, meanwhile, have the chance to deliver an early blow to title rivals Chelsea. Spurs host Antonio Conte's men at Wembley on Sunday, 20 August (16:00 BST).\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

It is promising,\" said the former Everton and Chelsea striker.\nLimp display dampens Hammers' pre-season optimism\nOptimism has been high at West Ham after a productive summer for manager Slaven Bilic - but some of that may have disappeared after they were easily brushed aside at Old Trafford.\nBilic said afterwards it was hard to find any positives, but one poor performance on the opening weekend does not mean the Hammers should necessarily panic, especially as several key players - including Manuel Lanzini, Andy Carroll and Michail Antonio - were missing through injury.\nThe Hammers' transfer policy over the summer has been clear: experienced internationals who have proven Premier League quality.\nThat arrived in the shape of Manchester City title-winning duo Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta, Stoke attacking midfielder Marko Arnautovic and former Manchester United striker Hernandez.\nRight-back Zabaleta probably came out with the most credit after a typically industrious display.\nBut questions may be asked over the ease with which England keeper Hart allowed Pogba's strike to creep in, while Hernandez barely had a sniff of a chance against his former club.\nThe Hammers only had one serious chance in a limp first-half performance - Edimilson Fernandes's fierce shot parried by David De Gea in the final kick before half-time - before Arnautovic's half-chance after the break.\nMan of the match - Nemanja Matic (Manchester United)\nLukaku loves a debut...\nRomelu Lukaku has now scored on his Premier League debut for three different clubs (West Bromwich Albion, Everton, Manchester United)\nLukaku has scored more goals in all competitions against West Ham than he has against any other English side (11).\nThe Belgian also became the 18th player to score on his Premier League debut for Manchester United, and the fourth to score a brace\nJose Mourinho has now won nine league games against West Ham, more than he has against any other opponent he's faced in his managerial career\nThis was Mourinho's biggest Premier League win as United manager, and biggest home win in the Premier League since his Chelsea side beat Arsenal 6-0 in March 2014\nAnthony Martial became the first Red Devils player since Nani against Liverpool in March 2008 to both score and assist a Premier League goal as a substitute\nWhat's next?\nManchester United will look to follow up this fine opening win when they go to Swansea on Saturday (12:30 BST).\nWest Ham face another away game - because their London Stadium has been hosting the World Athletics Championships - as they visit Southampton on the same day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 0-4 Manchester United\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho said he \"let the horses run freely\" after a blistering three-goal burst in four second-half minutes saw his team sweep aside Swansea City to continue their impressive winning start to the Premier League season.\n\"There was happiness in our play,\" said the United boss. \"There was no need to close the door.\n\"I felt in control, if you had a chance to look at me and my body language I think you could see that.\"\nHaving initially struggled to unlock their opponents' well-drilled defence despite taking the lead, United then opened the floodgates after 80 minutes as Romelu Lukaku confidently struck his third goal in two games for the club.\nPaul Pogba added a third two minutes later with a delicately lifted finish and, shortly afterwards, substitute Anthony Martial fired in low to give United a second 4-0 win from their first two matches of the campaign.\n\"They were waiting with class, calm and consistency for the moment to kill the game,\" added the Portuguese.\nHartson: Manchester United 'have been faultless'\n'Swansea need to do a bit of transfer business'\n\"Swansea played with five in the back and they had a moment when they felt they had to change and when they did we had more space and killed the game.\n\"Anthony Martial is working hard. He is confident. The French language connection is there to help him a lot and get to the level we know he can be because the potential is huge.\"\nEric Bailly had tapped in just before half-time to give United a 1-0 lead after a frantic start to the match with both teams hitting the bar - Jordan Ayew's scooped cross for the hosts and Phil Jones' header for United.\nAfter thrashing West Ham on the opening weekend, it had appeared this would be a sterner examination for United against an organised and defensively diligent Swansea side.\nMourinho's men seemed frustrated at times - Pogba had to be warned by referee Jon Moss after a quick succession of fouls - but after taking the lead, they seldom looked like squandering it against their spirited but limited opponents.\nRelive Manchester United's thrashing of Swansea\nFootball Daily podcast: 'Faultless' Man Utd hit four again\nImpressive United bide their time\nMourinho has never failed to win the league title in his second season at a club - including both his spells at Chelsea. A summer of heavy spending had fuelled the belief he could do so again despite finishing last term 24 points adrift of the champions.\n\"The word that describes the team now is confident,\" said Mourinho.\n\"At the moment, everything is going in our favour - but it's not always motorway - you find difficult roads and roadworks.\"\nWith their team unchanged from last Sunday's drubbing of West Ham, United were quick to take control of this encounter, with Nemanja Matic and Pogba dictating the tempo from the base of midfield.\nThe visitors enjoyed as much as 66% of possession but initially lacked incision in the final third, which seemed to frustrate their players.\nPogba had to be warned by referee Moss after hauling Martin Olsson to the ground just a few minutes after he was booked for fouling Tom Carroll.\nThe France midfielder then went on to provide a powerful header which was brilliantly palmed on to the bar by Lukasz Fabianski, only for the ball to drop invitingly for Bailly to convert from close range.\nUnited were happy to sit on that lead until the 81st minute when Henrikh Mkhitaryan found Lukaku unmarked in the box, and the Belgian swept in with his first real opportunity of the game.\nMourinho's side cut loose from that point, Pogba clipping the ball smartly over Fabianski and Martial finishing off a swift counter-attack to produce a scoreline which arguably flattered the visitors, as impressive as they were.\nSwansea begin life after Sigurdsson\nHaving held on for a goalless draw at Southampton a week earlier, this was Swansea's first game since selling Gylfi Sigurdsson - pivotal in their escape from relegation last season - to Everton for \u00a345m.\nThe Iceland midfielder's peach of a free-kick at Old Trafford in April was his third goal in three visits to United's home, so Mourinho and his players might have been glad to face a Swans side shorn of the influential playmaker.\nAlthough the Swans defended stubbornly for long periods, they offered precious little going forward.\nStrikers Ayew and Tammy Abraham worked relentlessly to pressurise United's defenders, but neither had a clear scoring opportunity as their team-mates struggled to hold on to the ball.\n\"We were competitive for long periods of the game,\" said head coach Paul Clement afterwards.\n\"There were enough good things to say to the players - we mustn't get our confidence affected by that.\n\"The second goal was even more disappointing than the first, I thought it was a gift. We missed tackles in midfield and then we were out of position at the back. They punished us and then we played to their strengths. We were 2-0 down, but a loose pass, they are so strong on the counter-attack and in the set-plays. It's a hard one to take in the end.\"\nClement has said he wants to use the funds from Sigurdsson's sale to sign at least two or three players and, on the evidence of their first two games of the season, he will need to spend that money wisely and quickly.\nMan of the match - Nemanja Matic (Manchester United)\nWhat next?\nSwansea switch their attention to cup action, taking on League One MK Dons in the EFL Cup on Tuesday.\nManchester United do not enter that competition just yet - and do not have a midweek fixture. They play Leicester at Old Trafford in the Premier League at 17:30 BST on 26 August.\nUnited's most prolific start in 110 years - the stats\nManchester United have scored four or more goals in their opening two league games of a season for the first time in 110 years (1907-08)\nThis is just the second time a team has won their opening two top-flight games of a season by 4-0 (also Chelsea in 2010-11)\nThe Swans have managed just one shot on target in 180 minutes of Premier League action this season\nThis is the third successive Premier League season that Manchester United have won their opening two matches of the campaign - however, they finished both 2016-17 and 2015-16 outside the top four\nEric Bailly is just the third African player to score for Manchester United in the Premier League. Quinton Fortune and Mame Biram Diouf are the others\nPaul Pogba has scored in three consecutive league appearances for only the second time in his career (also in January 2015 for Juventus)\nThere were just three minutes and 41 seconds between Manchester United's final three goals of the game"

If you have talent, everything is more easy.\"\n'Disappointing' Bournemouth frustrate boss Howe\nBournemouth finished in their highest position in English football last season when they came ninth in the top flight, but they have made a terrible start to this campaign, losing twice and not scoring in either of those defeats.\nIn a lacklustre match, the hosts struggled and only had two shots on target with Gomes denying Afobe and blocking a Steve Cook header from a corner.\nThe Cherries signed Jermain Defoe in the summer on a free transfer from Sunderland, but the England striker failed to make an impact when he came on as a 59th-minute substitute, touching the ball only three times.\n\"I thought we were very disappointing and I'm scratching my head as to why,\" said Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe. \"We are hugely disappointed and I would expect us to play a lot better than that.\n\"We were very poor on the ball today. I'm concerned generally and we haven't looked like scoring so there is plenty of hard work to do. We now have Manchester City and Arsenal so we need to react very quickly.\"\nWatford deserve rare away win\nWatford, under former boss Walter Mazzarri, lost their last seven away matches of the 2016-17 campaign, but claimed an away league win at the first time of asking under Silva, who replaced the Italian in the summer.\nIt was a deserved victory, as the opening goal came not long after Nathaniel Chalobah had wasted the best opportunity of the match when he had been denied by Asmir Begovic with only the goalkeeper to beat.\nGray, making his first Watford start since his \u00a318.5m move from Burnley in the summer, had earlier missed a good chance when he shot over, but he made amends with a fine cross from the right wing which Richarlison prodded home at the second opportunity.\nWatford had not won an away Premier League match since a 2-1 victory over Arsenal on 31 January, and home stewards struggled to hold the away fans back after Richarlison's opener.\nThere were more reasons for the Hornets' supporters to celebrate with four minutes left when Capoue controlled the ball on his chest and hit a fine strike from 25 yards past Begovic in one of the few moments of genuine quality in the match.\nWatford finished only one place above the relegation zone last season and Silva was delighted with the efforts from his new side.\n\"I am very satisfied, it was a very good game between two teams who played to win the match,\" said Silva. \"Congratulations to our players, they did everything I wanted and we showed great character and attitude again.\n\"It was a balanced game in the first half and in the second half were were better.\n\"We had a very good second half, we controlled it and had lots of chances to score and we deserved the three points.

But it is only three points, we need to rest and analyse to prepare for the next match.\"\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Watford)\nWatford end poor run - the stats\nCourtesy of their win against Bournemouth, Watford ended a run of seven Premier League games without a victory (drew one, lost six).\nMarco Silva enjoyed his first-ever away win in the Premier League in his 10th game on the road in the competition (won one, drew two, lost seven).\nBournemouth have failed to score in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2016.\nThe Cherries have kept just four clean sheets in 2017 in the Premier League, fewer than any side to play in the top flight both last season and this season.\nRicharlison is the sixth Watford player to score on his first Premier League start for the Hornets and the first since Miguel Layun in August 2015 (vs Everton).\nEtienne Capoue has scored two goals in his past three Premier League games, as many as in his previous 30 appearances in the competition.\nWatford's tally of 19 shots was their most in a Premier League away game since they were re-promoted before 2015-16.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth play away at Championship side Birmingham City in the second round of the League Cup on Tuesday, 22 August (19:45 BST) before returning to Premier League action in the early game on Saturday, 26 August when they entertain Manchester City (12:30).\nFor Watford, they are at home in the League Cup against Bristol City of the Championship on Tuesday, before another home match, this time against Brighton, in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00)."

However, Benteke was well placed to give Palace a 57th-minute lead after excellent work by Loftus-Cheek but somehow hammered the ball over the bar. It was a huge let-off for Liverpool.\nNevertheless, this was a much-improved performance by Frank de Boer's team after their Huddersfield defeat, and they were well organised and solid at the back in the first half.\nThey also lost their opening two games of last season before bouncing back to finish seven points above the relegation zone in 14th spot.\nMan of the match - Andrew Robertson (Liverpool)\n'We defended brilliantly' - manager reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"It was difficult. We could have played a little clearer in the first half. We defended brilliantly and we had the ball all of the time - it felt like 85% possession. You need to make the right decisions and in the first half we didn't. We could have finished more often than we did, but had our moments.\n\"The second half was much better and I loved the goal we scored because it was not our best one-two in the game. It was a nice goal and we deserved it a lot.\n\"At 1-0 up we made the ball do the work. We could have closed the game earlier, we didn't. It was an all-inclusive package.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Frank de Boer:\n\"We were quite concentrated for almost all of the match. I saw a team who wants to fight for each other. It could be a draw, a Liverpool win or the other way - with our two chances it could have been different.\n\"A lot of times they were frustrated because we played very organised.\n\"Today this was the best tactic to get the result, but the coin could have fallen the other way.\"\n'Impressive debut' - the stats\nRobertson, who made his Premier League debut for the Reds, created more chances (three) and had more touches of the ball (134) than any other Liverpool player.\nDe Boer is only the second Dutch manager to suffer defeat in his first two Premier League games after Martin Jol, who lost his opening three in the competition.\nLiverpool have kept five clean sheets in their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.\nCrystal Palace have lost six of their past seven games in the Premier League, failing to score in each defeat.\nThe Reds kept a clean sheet against Crystal Palace for the first time in 14 competitive matches.\nLiverpool have lost just one of their past 14 Premier League matches - this fixture last season.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool will now look to finish off the job against Hoffenheim and secure a place in the Champions League group stage. The Reds lead the Bundesliga club 2-1 going into Wednesday's deciding play-off leg at Anfield (19:45 BST).\nPalace are also in midweek cup action.

The Austria international later apologised to the fans for his dismissal.\nThe first penalty was also an easy one to give, as former Saints defender Fonte pulled down Davis, but the second spot-kick in the 91st minute was a more contentious matter.\nZabaleta caught a rising Yoshida in the back, as he went to head the ball from close range, and Mason decided the Hammers defender had impeded his Southampton counter-part.\nWest Ham had earlier had a handball appeal against Stephens waved away, while the referee did not punish Mark Noble for his rash challenge on Saints midfielder Mario Lemina, who was making his debut following his \u00a318.1m move from Juventus.\nSaints finally start scoring\nBefore facing the Hammers, Southampton had not scored on home soil since 5 April - 576 minutes of football.\nThey had 29 shots against Swansea last week, landing only two on target in their goalless draw, so there was a collective sigh of relief around St Mary's when Gabbidani slotted home after Nathan Redmond's through ball.\nSaints were only able to score from open play once during the match, but Gabbiadini and Redmond both went close with long-range efforts.\nSubstitute Shane Long had the ball in the net in the second-half but referee Mason had already blown for a foul on goalkeeper Hart in the build-up.\nHernandez shines for unhappy Hammers\nWith their home ground out of use until next month following the athletics World Championships, it was always going to be a testing start to the season for West Ham.\nThey started their run of four consecutive away matches with an embarrassing 4-0 defeat against Manchester United last weekend, but put in a much-improved display at St Mary's - even after going down to 10 men.\nHernandez, who arrived for \u00a316m from Bayer Leverkusan, lived up to his reputation as a potent poacher with his first two goals for his new club.\nThe Mexico international tapped in West Ham's opener after Fraser Forster parried Michail Antonio's shot into his path, and did the same again for his second goal - this time after Diafra Sakho's header came off the woodwork.\nBoss Slaven Bilic said of his new striker: \"We knew what we were getting with Hernandez: a really great player, great character, team player, really enthusiastic.\n\"You're expecting goals from him but on top of the goals, his determination; he sacrificed for the team in the best possible way.\"\nWhile Hernandez looks to have settled in well, on-loan goalkeeper Hart still looked nervous at times and his confidence may be dented further after conceding seven goals in two matches.\nArnautovic apologises to the fans\nMarko Arnautovic posted a message on social media after the game: \"I want to apologise to all of the West Ham fans. Just want to let you know that I didn't want to let me team down and you fans. A big apology to you all.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic on Arnautovic's sending off: \"It is a big blow because you have to play with 10 men for a big part of the game. We have spoken about everything and that will stay inside the dressing room.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was a difficult game because we had everything under control after a sending off and two goals. This is football.\n\"West Ham are a strong team and they won a lot of balls in our box. It was a nice game to see, but difficult for a manager to be in.\"\nMan of the match - Dusan Tadic\nSaints' nine-hour wait for a goal\nGabbiadini's goal ended a run of nine hours and 15 minutes without a Premier League goal at St Mary's for Southampton.\nMarko Arnautovic has been sent off versus Southampton in each of his last two Premier League appearances against them.\nSince the start of 2015-16, West Ham have conceded more goals from the penalty spot than any other Premier League team (15).\nAll 39 of Javier Hernandez's Premier League goals have come inside the box.\nThere were more goals scored in this match (five) than in Southampton's previous five home Premier League games combined (three).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Wolves in the EFL Cup on Wednesday (19:45 BST), before returning to league action against Huddersfield on Saturday, 26 August (15:00 BST).\nWest Ham are also in EFL Cup action on Wednesday at League Two side Cheltenham Town (19:45 BST) before travelling to Newcastle on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

The Wales international, who came on seven minutes earlier, pounced on a Matt Phillips flick, held off two challenges and fired in low past keeper Tom Heaton.\nHowever, the 28-year-old striker did not see out the rest of the match as he was shown a red card in the 83rd minute for catching Matt Lowton with his elbow.\nBurnley wasted chances at the other end, and will be hoping Leeds striker Chris Wood, who they look likely to sign, will be less profligate.\nBen Mee had the Clarets' best chance but missed with a two-yard header, and team-mate Johann Berg Gudmundsson also went close with a low curling shot.\nRelive the action from Turf Moor\nReaction from Saturday's other Premier League matches\nRobson-Kanu's 20-minute cameo\nIt was a brief, yet eventful appearance by Robson-Kanu.\nHis goal was brilliant, and will rank alongside the strikes against Southampton last season and his Euro 2016 effort against Belgium.\nThis one was about perseverance. The forward, with the ball in possession, battled past Gudmundsson and James Tarkowski before striking past Heaton.\nHe led the line well after the goal, but then showed a bit too much aggression as he challenged Lowton for the ball right in front of referee Martin Atkinson.\nThere were few complaints from both Robson-Kanu and his team-mates.\nBurnley restricted by tight Baggies\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis will have been delighted with his side's display, particularly at the back.\nThe visitors restricted Burnley to largely half-chances, with six of the 15 efforts on goal falling to Jeff Hendrick.\nThe Republic of Ireland midfielder had one angled strike in the area superbly blocked and was rushed by the Baggies backline into producing inaccurate shots.\nIceland international Gudmundsson was unlucky to see his excellent low curling shot drift wide, but his team-mates Mee and Jon Walters will not want to see a replay of their golden heading chances.\n'There's good spirit in the Baggies dressing room' - reaction\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"It is a great start for us, especially with two clean sheets.\n\"I've not looked at the red card incident. I don't want to say things that will get me in trouble. The decisions stands. I am so pleased we got through that final 15 minutes with 10 men. There is good spirit in the dressing room and we needed that today. Our fitness level were fantastic.\"\nOn Jonny Evans and reported interest from Manchester City: \"They all deal through the football club, I won't get involved in that.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"The game is unfair sometimes and today I thought it was.

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion\nHarry Maguire scored his first Leicester goal as the Foxes eased to a first win of the season against a timid Brighton side in a scrappy affair at King Power Stadium.\nThe hosts led inside a minute when Shinji Okazaki tapped in after new Seagulls goalkeeper Mathew Ryan spilled a low effort from the impressive Riyad Mahrez.\nBrighton's Glenn Murray had a goal disallowed for offside before the break but, in truth, the newly promoted side offered little threat as they fell to a second successive defeat in the top tier.\nMaguire - who saw more of the ball than any Leicester player - rose at the back post to head in a Mahrez corner after the break, effectively ending the contest and ensuring the Foxes responded from last week's 4-3 defeat at Arsenal.\nCraig Shakespeare's side produced an efficient display without ever seeming to build relentless pressure, but their day was soured a little in injury time when Jamie Vardy was forced to hobble off after contesting a 50-50 ball with Ryan.\nRelive the action from King Power Stadium\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nMaguire shines as Foxes cruise\nVardy proved a willing runner throughout and had a fine chance of his own in the opening period but failed to make a solid connection after Okazaki had pulled the ball back to him about 10 yards out.\nOkazaki looked lively early on, dropping in behind Vardy with both sides playing 4-4-1-1, and he found himself perfectly placed when Ryan failed to hold a Mahrez strike which was straight at him.\nIt was the first goal scored inside a minute of the Premier League season and summed up why Leicester fans will hope interest in Mahrez from Roma cools as he drifted past defenders graciously in the build-up.\nIt gave Leicester the platform to play safe football against a Brighton side who never looked capable of taking the risks to open them up and Maguire's goal summed up the simplicity of the victory as he out-jumped Shane Duffy to nod in.\nThe summer signing from Hull City seemed comfortable alongside central defensive partner Wes Morgan and already looks like astute business at \u00a317m.\nImmediate thoughts will focus on the fitness of Vardy, though Shakespeare played down any worry over the ankle injury afterwards.\nVardy's energy remains critical to Shakespeare's side, who will surely believe they can offer more than they did in this scrappy showing, where they saw less of the ball and were less accurate with it than the visitors.\nWill Brighton find their feet?\nChris Hughton's side had 55% of possession and completed 83% of their passes compared to 78% achieved by their hosts. However, their cutting edge was minimal and they managed just two shots on target.\nSubstitute Tomer Hemed went closest, forcing a diving save from Kasper Schmeichel from 25 yards. The Israeli replaced Glenn Murray, who finished smartly in the first half only to be correctly ruled offside.\nThere will be moments Hughton can cling to. His side had a shout for a penalty when Morgan used a combination of chest and arm to block from Jamie Murphy before the break and they also looked solid in their shape without the ball.\nBut they seemed to lack the ability to turn that disciplined structure into any form of attacking force and the former Newcastle boss will surely know this defeat is another lesson on the way to finding what is needed at the top level.\nMistakes such as Ryan's at such key moments cannot happen - though there is much to look forward to, not least the debut of record signing Jose Izquierdo, who joined in midweek.\nHughton has broken the club's transfer record three times this summer and brought in players from leagues across Europe. His side looked like a unit yet to gel but they will have easier fixtures than a visit from Manchester City and a trip to the 2015-16 champions.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez\n'Professional performance' - manager talk\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare: \"When you get a start like that it's very pleasing. It was hard to break them down today but it was a professional performance to the end.\n\"It didn't feel as comfortable as the stats suggest. We learned cruelly about game management last week [in the 4-3 defeat by Arsenal], but to get the first win under the belt was the main thing.\"\nBrighton & Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton: \"We didn't help ourselves and the timing of both goals was very detrimental to our style of play.\n\"We've got to keep possession, we need to get into shape but we had ample opportunity over the 90 minutes to do better. They aren't a side who really opened us up, but where they needed to be sharper and keep possession they did. That's what we need to learn.\n\"We'll look to add to the squad. We'll work as hard as we can through to the end of window to make this team and squad as good as we can.\"\nWorrying Brighton form? - Key stats\nBrighton have failed to score in four of their last five league games, netting only one goal in that time (v Aston Villa in May).\nOkazaki has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time ever, with both of his goals coming within the first five minutes of games.\nRiyad Mahrez has assisted in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February 2016.\nHarry Maguire has netted three goals in his last eight Premier League games, after none in his 26 before that.\nThe Seagulls are without a win in five league games (D1 L4), their worst run since January 2016 (7 games).\nUp next?\nAfter a League Cup trip to Sheffield United in midweek Leicester will travel to top-of-the-table Manchester United for next Saturday's late kick-off. Brighton host Barnet in the EFL Cup on Tuesday and take on Watford at Vicarage Road next Saturday."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 1-0 Arsenal\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger complained his side were denied a goal and a penalty as Jese Rodriguez enjoyed a dream start to his Stoke City career by scoring the winner against the Gunners.\nFormer Real Madrid winger Jese, who was thrust straight into Mark Hughes' side after arriving from Paris St-Germain on Wednesday, slid in from a tight angle after being left unmarked to pick up Saido Berahino's pass.\nThe Spaniard's strike came just 90 seconds into the second half, after an opening 45 minutes the visitors had dominated.\nWenger felt his team should have been given a first-half penalty when Hector Bellerin fell under a clumsy challenge by Mame Biram Diouf.\n'I don't think we're in for a good season at all' - Arsenal fan\nPodcast: listen back to 5 live's 606 phone-in\nAnd Arsenal thought they had equalised when Alexandre Lacazette rifled in, only for the France striker to be ruled offside by a tiny margin.\n\"We know we don't get penalties,\" said Wenger. \"Look at the numbers and you will see.\n\"We had last year the highest number of penalties against us at home by a mile and the lowest number for us. So I give you just the numbers. I don't say anything else.\"\nWenger's side were awarded six penalties last season, a tally bettered by only five other Premier League sides. Four of those were given at Emirates Stadium, only Tottenham (seven) and Bournemouth (five) won more at home.\nThe Gunners conceded 10 penalties in their 38 games - the second highest tally after relegated Hull City (13). Five were given against Arsenal at the Emirates, while Hull had six awarded against them at home.\nOn Lacazette's disallowed strike, the Frenchman added: \"I believe we scored a regular goal that was not offside. It is an easy decision. Even his foot was not offside.\"\nThe Gunners continued to press in the closing stages at the Bet365 Stadium but Stoke, who had only 23% possession, remained resolute to earn their first win of the Premier League season.\nRelive the action from the Bet365 Stadium\nCan Stoke help Jese rebuild his career?\nStoke have managed to attract a few players with impressive pedigree over recent seasons, but perhaps none more exciting than Spain international Jese.\nThe 24-year-old forward was considered one of the best products of his generation in the Real Madrid academy by some observers, only for his career to stall after he suffered a serious knee injury - ironically as a result of a challenge from Arsenal opponent Saed Kolasinac, who was then playing for Schalke - shortly before the 2014 World Cup.\nAfter failing to force his way back into Real's plans following his recovery, an underwhelming spell at French giants Paris St-Germain followed before he attempted to rebuild his career with a loan move to hometown club Las Palmas.\nThe La Liga side decided he did not offer enough to warrant a longer deal - amid reports he was distracted by his rap band\n, external\n- which has allowed Stoke to bring him to the Premier League.\nOn the evidence of his match-winning debut, it may prove a shrewd signing by Potters boss Hughes.\nJese showed glimpses of his attacking flair and willingness to work throughout, none more so than for what proved to be the only goal of the game.\nHe started the move on the halfway line, driving forward with pace and purpose, before finding substitute Berahino on the left and then continuing his surge to collect a return pass and convert.\nEventually he ran out of steam - unsurprising after being left out of PSG's pre-season plans - and received a standing ovation when he was replaced after 70 minutes.\nStoke fans will be hoping his goal was the first of many during his season-long loan.\nArsenal's failings exposed again by Stoke\nStoke has long been considered a place where Arsenal's soft underbelly gets exposed against a physical home side - and so it proved again.\nArsenal won for the first time in seven trips to the Potteries when they cruised to a 4-1 victory at the end of last season, leading Arsene Wenger to confidently predict his team could cope with the challenge posed by the home side.\nBut, as has been an all too familiar sight for Gunners fans, they lacked steel and aggression in key areas of the pitch.\nThis was illustrated in the build-up to Stoke's winner.\nA sloppy pass from Granit Xhaka towards a flat-footed Mesut Ozil gave the ball back to Stoke, with neither player working hard enough to retrieve the ball as Jese broke forward.\n\"We know not to make defensive mistakes and we came out after half-time too sluggish. We were punished,\" said a frustrated Wenger.\nIn truth, Arsenal could have already been well in command after a dominant first-half performance in which they had over 70% possession.\nStill without the injured Alexis Sanchez, the visitors forced Potters keeper Jack Butland into a string of a splendid saves, particularly from angled drives by Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck, while Arsenal's players felt they should have been given a penalty when Bellerin burst into the penalty area.\nThe Gunners boss threw on substitutes Oliver Giroud - who rescued them in their opening win against Leicester - Theo Walcott and Alex Iwobi in the final stages, but the forwards could not mask their team's defensive deficiencies for the second game running.\nMan of the match - Jack Butland (Stoke City)\nPossession is not everything... - the stats\nStoke have lost just once in their past eight home Premier League games against the Gunners, winning four and drawing three.\nArsenal posted their highest amount of possession in a Premier League game (77.3%) since 2003-04.\nOnly five teams have won a Premier League game with a lower share of possession than Stoke.\nSince Stoke City's first Premier League campaign in 2008-09, Arsenal have suffered six defeats away at the Potters in all competitions. In this period, they've only suffered more competitive defeats at Manchester United (eight) and Chelsea (seven), and have also lost six times at Manchester City.\nThe Gunners (732) attempted 520 more passes than Stoke (212) in the game.\nArsenal have registered just one clean sheet in their past nine top-flight away games.\nArsenal have now failed to win both of their opening two league games every season since 2009-10.\nJese is the third player to score on their Premier League debut for Stoke, after Ricardo Fuller in 2008 and Michael Kightly in 2012.\nBerahino provided an assist for the first time in 57 Premier League appearances, since last assisting in April 2015 for West Brom against QPR.\nWhat's next?\nStoke boss Hughes has the chance, perhaps, to rotate his squad when the Potters host League One side Rochdale in the EFL Cup on Wednesday (20:00 BST).\nArsenal are not in midweek cup action as the Europa League qualifiers do not enter the competition until the third round, meaning they have an eight-day break before travelling to Liverpool in the Premier League next Sunday (16:00)."

Bar a superb save from Matt Ritchie, Danish goalkeeper Jonas Lossl did not have to repeat his heroics at Crystal Palace on the opening weekend.\nIt is now two defeats in two league games for Rafael Benitez's Newcastle, and with time running out in the transfer window the Toon Army might have to endure another nail-biting season.\nPremier League debutants Huddersfield looked far more confident in possession and did much to trouble Newcastle's back four if not goalkeeper Rob Elliot, with Tom Ince's first-half snap-shot their only other effort of note.\nRelive the action from John Smith's Stadium\nBBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nMooy is Huddersfield's key man\nMooy, the midfielder from Sydney, seems to have found his home at Huddersfield, having seen his career take him from St Mirren to Melbourne.\nHe scored only four goals in last season's promotion campaign, but it was his pressing, endless energy and quality of passing that saw him named the club's player of the season.\nThe 26-year-old appears to be playing a more advanced position this season, and against Newcastle he produced more passes in the opposition half than any of his team-mates.\nManager David Wagner will have been pleased with his work rate, and delighted with his 50th-minute goal.\nMooy drove forward and played a one-two with Elias Kachunga before placing a superb shot beyond the reach of Elliot.\nThe win moves the Yorkshire club level on points with leaders Manchester United.\nThe momentum is on Huddersfield's side and they will fancy their chances of making it three wins out of three when they host Southampton next weekend.\nMagpies set for another season of struggle?\nNewcastle fans will be thinking history is repeating.\nLike their 2015-16 relegation season, there has been a lack of movement in the transfer window, which has disheartened the Toon Army.\nInjuries to key defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune against Tottenham last week - and the straight red for captain Jonjo Shelvey - came at a bad time for a squad already lacking quality in depth.\nAgainst Huddersfield they were shaky at the back and lacked a cutting edge up top.\nHowever, the second-half cameo of \u00a35m signing Joselu no doubt lifted some of the travelling fans. The Spanish striker, who failed to settle at Stoke, held the ball up well to provide a useful attacking outlet.\nHe also produced a scuffed effort that needed Lossl to dive low and push away. It was an easy save, though.\nBenitez's side face fellow early-season strugglers West Ham at home next week.\nMan of the match - Aaron Mooy (Huddersfield)\n'We made one mistake' - reaction\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"I am very happy and proud the players followed our idea to keep Newcastle as far away from our goal as possible. We gave no big chances away and our defence was very sharp.\n\"We had one magic moment from Mooy, enough to win the game. I am delighted with the performance and result.\n\"We got promoted at Wembley but we have started the season with two wins and six points. This is unbelievable. Everybody has invested so much and I am happy for them.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"You cannot make too many mistakes in the Premier League. We made one mistake, gave Mooy too much time on the ball and we conceded.\n\"You have to take your chances. We tried to create more chances after the Matt Ritchie effort. The reaction from the team was good to going behind.\n\"We are at the beginning and we have to keep going. The only way to improve is to train harder.\"\nMooy exposes Newcastle again - the stats\nExcluding the debut season of the Premier League in 1992-93, Huddersfield are the first team to win their opening two games in the competition\nNewcastle have lost their first two games of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 1999-2000\nThe Terriers are the second newly promoted team to keep a clean sheet in their first two Premier League games following promotion (after Charlton in 1997-98)\nNewcastle have now gone 12 away games without a win in the Premier League, losing 10 of them (D2)\nTwo of Mooy's five league goals for Huddersfield have come against Newcastle, with both coming in home fixtures\nThe Australian's strike ended a Huddersfield run of 316 minutes without scoring in league competition at the John Smith's Stadium\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield are at home to Southampton in the league next Saturday, while the Magpies face West Ham at St James' Park on the same day (both 15:00 BST)."

He slumped in despair as he headed the chance wide.\nMorata had few more opportunities to show his undoubted class and looked out on his feet when he was replaced by Batshuayi.\nThe striker's undoubted pedigree will surface but this was all part of his Premier League education. He will have better days than this one.\nMan of the match - Marcos Alonso (Chelsea)\nWhat they said\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am disappointed because we deserved more but they were very clinical with two shots on target and two goals. We dominated and we were better but if you are not clinical, you can lose like today.\n\"We are one step ahead than last season.

City struggled to break them down.\nThis was a common theme in Guardiola's first season, as away teams arrived at the Etihad content to defend and leave with a point.\nWhile only losing once in front of their own fans, City racked up seven draws and their 40 points earned was only the sixth best home record in the top flight.\nAll was going smoothly at the start of Guardiola's reign - until Everton turned up in October.\nCity had 19 shots and 72% possession as the stubborn Toffees left with a 1-1 draw last season, providing a blueprint of how to frustrate the hosts which was successfully followed by Southampton, Middlesbrough and Stoke.\nEverton tried to implement the same tactic in a disciplined and almost perfect away performance. For 82 minutes, they largely managed to do that as City were restricted to just David Silva's first-half shot against the post and a wild strike over the bar by Sterling.\nEventually City's pressure told as a poor header by young full-back Holgate - who otherwise had an excellent game on the right - fell for Sterling to convert from 12 yards.\nMan of the match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nNot a happy 200th for Walker - the stats\nCity defender Walker's two yellow cards were just one minute and 57 seconds apart.\nIt was Walker's first Premier League red card in his 200th appearance in the competition.\nEverton are the first team Guardiola has failed to beat in his first three league meetings as a manager.\nEverton named eight English players in their starting XI - the first time they have had as many in a Premier League game since 26 December 1997.\nSterling's goal was the first Everton have let in this season, having gone 441 minutes without conceding before the 82nd-minute strike.\nSterling has scored in 11 different Premier League games for City, but this was the first time he has netted in one they did not win.\nAguero has now failed to score in his past seven Premier League appearances against Everton.\nWhat's next?\nCity, who won at Brighton on the opening weekend, go to Bournemouth on Saturday (12:30 BST) looking for their second win of the season on the south coast.\nEverton switch their attention to the Europa League, going to Hajduk Split on Thursday with a 2-0 first-leg advantage as they aim to reach the group stage.\nThe Toffees return to Premier League action with a trip to champions Chelsea on Sunday (13:30 BST)."

Hopefully they can call me and explain the reason why,\" Guardiola told BBC Sport.\nGabriel Jesus had earlier cancelled out Charlie Daniels' goal for Bournemouth.\nThe home side dominated the early exchanges and took a deserved lead on 13 minutes when Daniels drilled home a stunning half-volley off the crossbar from the edge of the area.\nBut City equalised eight minutes later with their first shot on target, David Silva picking out Jesus with a perfectly weighted pass for the Brazilian to roll the ball home.\nThe goal seemed to spark the visitors into life and they dominated the rest of the half without adding to their score.\nBoth teams had chances after the break, with Bournemouth's Joshua King and City's Nicolas Otamendi hitting the post.\nKing had another opportunity to win it for the hosts when he outmuscled Benjamin Mendy, but his shot was straight at Ederson.\nSterling's winner came moments later, sparking wild celebrations in a finale City captain Vincent Kompany described it as \"madness\".\nHe told Sky Sports: \"The first thing I did was say to Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva: 'Welcome to the Premier League'.\"\nRelive City's dramatic win at the Vitality Stadium\nWas Sterling's red card right?\nWhile City's fighting spirit will draw praise, Dean's performance will not elicit the same response.\nFootball's laws\n, external\nstate players must be cautioned if they \"approach the spectators in a manner which can cause safety and/or security issues\".\n\"We don't invite the fans? Maybe we play without fans?\" Guardiola said to Sky Sports.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer tweeted:\n, external\n\"Don't give me 'it's the law' nonsense. Mike Dean has clearly never experienced scoring the winning goal.\n\"And for all saying 'but it is the law' if we are going to rigidly apply law with no common sense, why did he only book Sterling?\"\nEx-West Ham striker Bobby Zamora wrote:\n, external\n\"Can't celebrate a goal now? Absolute joke.\"\nAnd former Spurs striker Garth Crooks, speaking on the BBC's Final Score, said: \"Who is Mike Dean appealing to by sending him off for that? It's certainly not the crowd.\"\nSterling is the first Premier League player to be sent off for excessive celebration since Frederic Piquionne for West Ham against Everton in January 2011.\nBut his dismissal was not the only controversial decision in the match.\nBournemouth's Nathan Ake could have been sent off for a blatant first-half trip on Jesus when the striker was through on goal. He was only booked.\n\"I think Mike Dean has got that one wrong,\" said former Premier League goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on BBC Radio 5 live. \"Ake should have been sent off.\"\nGuardiola rings the changes\nWhile Sterling's dismissal dominated the post-match analysis, all the talk before the game had centred on Guardiola's team selection.\nThe Spaniard made four changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Everton on Monday, with striker Sergio Aguero dropping to the bench.\nDefender John Stones was also among the substitutes, while Mendy made his debut and Danilo came in for the suspended Kyle Walker.\nCity, who played three at the back against Everton and Brighton, reverted to a back four, with full-backs Mendy and Danilo pushed high up the pitch.\nIn between them, and after an uncomfortable opening 20 minutes, Otamendi eventually settled alongside Kompany.\nCity had more than 70% possession in the match, and Guardiola was happy his team came away with all three points.\nHe told Sky Sports: \"Winning in the last minute is always special.\n\"It was a tough game. It is always complicated against Bournemouth. They play long balls, balls into the channels and play set-pieces, but we got into the game.\"\nFor Bournemouth's part, though they impressed for periods of the match, their third successive league defeat means they are yet to win a point this season.\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe told BBC Sport: \"We thought we had hung on for a point. We had chances to win it, too. I am disappointed for the players and the supporters.\n\"The second half was bitty, we wanted that to be the case. I am enthused by the performance, which was better than our first two.\n\"We started really well, very positively. We created more chances today than in our first two games, but we need to start getting some points quickly.\n\"We knew it would be a different test. We had to be disciplined, which I felt we were, but one or two moments of class from them can hurt you.\"\nMan of the match - David Silva\nCity streak continues, Cherries drop points again\nBournemouth have lost their first three league games in a campaign for the first time since 1994-95 in the third tier.\nSince the start of the 2015-16 season, only West Ham (41) have dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League than Bournemouth (39 - level with Liverpool).\nJesus has been directly involved in 12 goals in his 11 Premier League starts for Man City (eight goals, four assists).\nDaniels netted his eight goal in the Premier League, but this was his first from outside the box.\nCity have gone 11 Premier League games without defeat for the first time since September 2015 (won eight, drawn three).\nAguero failed to score in an away Premier League appearance for the first time since February, also against Bournemouth.\nSterling has scored six Premier League goals against Bournemouth; more than versus any other club in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, City host Liverpool on Saturday, 9 September, while Bournemouth travel to Arsenal."

Against West Ham, it was the system he played and the determination his players showed which won the day.\nBoth Ritchie and Isaac Hayden were exceptional with their dogged work in midfield, especially ex-Bournemouth winger Ritchie.\nHe forced midfielder Declan Rice into losing possession which resulted in the opener. The loose ball found its way to Merino, who played a beautifully-weighted pass for Atsu. The Ghana winger squared the ball for Joselu, who poked in under pressure.\nThe Magpies increased their lead when Scot Ritchie's cross from the right found defender Clark, who nodded in. And then Mitrovic, perhaps lucky not to see a card for a stray arm which caught Manuel Lanzini, added the third after Newcastle had again pinched the ball from West Ham in their final third.\nHammers teenager learns harsh lesson\nRice, 18, was taken off at half-time, seemingly because his confidence was shattered after the mistake that led to Newcastle's opener.\nHe was consoled by Hart straight after the goal, but the teenager knew the significance of his mistake in a side that was also short of confidence.\nTheir best chances came after the break when Rob Elliot blocked Aaron Cresswell's effort and took the sting out of Javier Hernandez's follow-up before Clark cleared the ball off the line.\nThe international break will give Hammers boss Slaven Bilic time to work out why it is not clicking for his side.\n'It was a game of mistakes' - reaction\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"When you are losing it is difficult, when you are winning everyone is happy.\n\"We won with everyone trying so hard. The fans were crucial last year and they have to be crucial this year - they are trying to help. I think I have some friends in the stands.\n\"I said before that Joselu needed to be fit. He did well. It was a great effort. Matt Ritchie is an important player - the way he works is an example for the others.\n\"We will try and bring in players that will give us something different. We know these players.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We made a mistake that led to their first goal and it gave them a boost.\n\"We came back in the second half and we better in the first 10 minutes, but it's a game of mistakes. We didn't play good. They were the better side. The goals helped them. They deserved those goals because they pressured high up the pitch.\n\"We have to admit they were better in everything, especially in determination and wanting to win second balls and making a transition when doing that. We didn't deserve anything. We had a midweek game but that had nothing to do with today's performance.\n\"We are trying to be active [in the transfer market] still but I was happy with the team, it was just the performance that was not good. We can talk about the away games but I expected a lot, lot more.\"\nMan of the match - Matt Ritchie (Newcastle)\nHart not keeping it clean - the stats\nWest Ham have lost all three of their Premier League games this season - the last time that they did this was in 2010-11, when they finished bottom\nThis was Newcastle's 18th Premier League win against West Ham - only against Aston Villa (22) and Tottenham (21) have they won more often\nThis was the 18th time (in 79 games) that West Ham have conceded three or more goals in a Premier League match under Slaven Bilic, including all three games this season\nMitrovic has scored five and provided assists for two more in his last 10 Premier League appearances\nIt is now 22 league appearances without a clean sheet for Hart (Premier League and Serie A combined) - last keeping one on 8 January for Torino against Sassuolo\nIn fact, Hart has conceded 20 goals in his last six appearances in league competition\nJoselu has now scored in five different Premier League matches and has ended on the winning side on each occasion\nJoselu became the fourth different Spanish player to net a Premier League goal for Newcastle, after Ayoze Perez (13), Albert Luque (1) and Xisco (1)\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle are at Swansea on Sunday, 10 September (16:00 BST) after the resumption and the Hammers host Huddersfield on Monday, 11 September (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-2 Swansea City\nCrystal Palace manager Frank de Boer said his side need to show more courage after Swansea picked up their first Premier League win of the season with a deserved victory at Selhurst Park.\nTammy Abraham put the away side ahead just before half-time with a low finish after beating Martin Kelly to Leroy Fer's cross, having earlier seen a close-range effort stopped by Wayne Hennessey following Timothy Fosu-Mensah's slip.\nKelly then tamely headed Palace's first effort on target from a corner after the break, before his mistake let Swansea in for their second.\nThe defender was robbed on the halfway line by Kyle Naughton, whose through ball was finished off by Jordan Ayew.\nYohan Cabaye came off the Palace bench for his first league appearance of the season and might have converted from a one-two with Jason Puncheon had it not been for Mike van der Hoorn's saving challenge, while Andros Townsend shot just wide after Alfie Mawson's sliced clearance with five minutes to go.\nPalace have now lost their opening three matches of the Premier League season under new boss Frank de Boer. They have failed to score a single goal, conceding five in two home matches.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, De Boer said: \"It wasn't until after we were 2-0 down that we showed we really can play.\n\"It is a very hard lesson for us. We have to show some balls from the first second of the game. If you do not show courage then you get punished,\" he added.\n\"In the second half you saw a different Palace - one who creates chances - and with a bit of luck you make one of those. It just wasn't the day for us. Hopefully you will see a different Palace after the international window.\"\nRelive Crystal Palace v Swansea\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nA happy return for Clement\n\"History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes,\" Mark Twain, author of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is supposed to have said.\nLast November Swansea beat Palace 5-4, with an astonishing seven goals scored after the break.\nBoth teams went into Saturday's game without a goal from their opening two matches of the new league season, but there was only really one side who looked like providing goals and entertainment.\nSwansea's front pair of Abraham and Ayew combined dangerously as early as the fourth minute when Ayew headed wide from Abraham's cross, and the away side controlled the entire first half, dominating possession and opening Palace up on several occasions.\nAfter the break Palace did improve slightly and there were a few errors at the back from defender Mawson, but once Ayew punished the home side for Kelly's mistake, the result never looked in doubt.\nSwansea manager Paul Clement watched his side beat Palace at Selhurst Park here in January, on the day he was appointed, and this was certainly a happy return.\nWorries for De Boer\nAfter James Tomkins was forced off injured in the first half - he appeared to suffer a muscle injury when striking a shot over the bar - Kelly came on to replace him.\nIt would be harsh to focus too much on one player in a toothless team performance, but the defender found himself at the heart of two key moments that ultimately may have settled the match.\nKelly will rue his missed header, directed straight towards Fabianksi after rising well above the static Mawson at a corner, and moments later the 27-year-old rashly tried to knock the ball past Naughton on the halfway line, a move the Swansea defender easily read.\nAyew was perhaps slightly lucky with his finish - Hennessey rushed out to block with his legs and the rebound fell kindly - but more worrying was the lack of confidence Palace displayed in the few chances they did create when trying to find a way back into the match.\nAfter the game, De Boer spoke of \"a lack of courage\" from his players, perhaps with the largely anonymous Christian Benteke in mind.\nMan of the match - Tammy Abraham (Swansea)\nThe Chelsea loanee scored Swansea's first goal of the season and looked a real threat up front in combination with Ayew. He had the strength to hold up play, the invention to find others, and displayed a clinical touch to find the net.\n'A positive start'\nSwansea boss Paul Clement, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is hard coming away from home in the Premier League, so four points out of two away games is very positive.\n\"Tammy Abraham and Jordan Ayew took their goals well, they both scored midweek, it's what you want from the strikers.

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-0 Leicester City\nSubstitutes Marcus Rashford and Marouane Fellaini both scored as Manchester United overcame a resolute Leicester to strengthen their position at the top of the Premier League.\nJose Mourinho's side had applied incessant pressure on the Foxes from kick-off, and Romelu Lukaku missed a second-half penalty prior to the goals, as they found it difficult to break the steadfast backline.\nThey finally breached the last line of defence when Rashford converted Henrikh Mkhitaryan's corner three minutes after coming on.\nAnd then midfielder Fellaini stuck out his knee to divert fellow substitute Jesse Lingard's drive past Kasper Schmeichel.\nUnited are the only side to have won all three of their opening league games this season and have yet to concede a goal.\nRelive the action from Old Trafford\nChange in tactics works for Mourinho\nUnited peppered the opposition area with crosses in the first half, but aside from a Paul Pogba strike that drifted narrowly wide, the threat from the wings was comfortably dealt with by the Foxes' defensive giants Wes Morgan and Harry Maguire.\nThere was a shift in manager Mourinho's thinking in the second half as his side began to breach the 18-yard area with shorter balls from a more central position.\nThat probing should have resulted in the opening goal. Leicester were once again on the back foot in their area before Anthony Martial struck a shot that came off Danny Simpson's arm. Referee Michael Oliver declared it to be deliberate handball.\nLukaku stepped up to the spot, but his hopes of a fourth league goal this season were thwarted by Schmeichel's dive to the right.\nLeicester continued to come under pressure and eventually succumbed when Rashford's instinctive shot flew past the Dane in goal in the 70th minute.\nHoles now began to appear in Leicester's previously watertight defence as they went looking for an equaliser.\nUnited capitalised again as substitute Lingard's low drive was diverted into the net by Fellaini, although replays suggested the Belgian was fractionally offside.\nFoxes lacked bite\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare should not be too despondent.\nHis side's valiant defensive display was reminiscent of those during the Premier League-winning campaign two seasons ago. It was at the other end that his men disappointed.\nAt Old Trafford, both Jamie Vardy - the Foxes' star striker of 2015-16 - and Shinji Okazaki were ineffective, while Riyad Mahrez teased the United defence without an end product.\nVardy was withdrawn with 15 minutes left, to be replaced by Islam Slimani.\nThe closest Leicester came to scoring was when substitute Andy King forced a brilliant point-blank save from David de Gea in the final few seconds of the match.\nMan of the match - Harry Maguire (Leicester)\n'Nine points after three matches is nothing different' - reaction\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho on winning the first three matches: \"We can look into perspective. Last season we won against Leicester at home so that doesn't make a difference, but we had too many draws at home last season.\n\"The difference is the quality of our football, we're playing better today. If we hadn't won this match I wouldn't have anyone to blame.\nThe team is playing very well and I'm very confident. We are comfortable on the ball and dangerous on the counter-attack. But nine points after three matches is nothing different for us, because we did that last season.\nLeicester boss Craig Shakespeare: \"I think we frustrated them for large parts of the game. When you come to Old Trafford in the form they are in, they will have big moments. We had our moments too, but could not see the game through.\n\"Set-pieces are our Achilles heel at the moment. We need to organise better.\n\"It was a harsh penalty, but a great save form Schmeichel. To go 1-0 down, it knocked a bit of spirit from us. I'm disappointed in the overall result, but we were nice and solid for large parts.\n\"You have to be disciplined; you know what the opposition's strengths are. We tried to attack in the second half.\n\"Maguire was carrying a knock but was desperate to play - he was solid.\"\nNew Man Utd penalty taker needed?\nManchester United have kept a clean sheet in their opening three league games of a season for the sixth time in their history and fourth in the Premier League era.\nHowever, the Red Devils failed to win the title in those previous five campaigns (1927-28, 1991-92, 1997-98, 2005-06, and 2015-16).\nManchester United will spend their 14th night at the top of the Premier League table in 2017-18 - the same number as in 2015-16 and 2016-17 combined (14).\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan equalled the Premier League record for most assists in his first three apps in a season (five by Ruel Fox in 1994-95).\nRomelu Lukaku has missed two of his last three penalties taken in the Premier League.\nSeven of Marcus Rashford's 11 Premier League goals have come at Old Trafford (64%).\nWhat's next?\nUnited are at Stoke on Saturday, 9 September (17:30 BST) when the Premier League resumes after the international break.

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-0 Everton\nChelsea produced a dominant home performance to comfortably beat Everton for their second win of the Premier League season.\nCesc Fabregas broke Everton's resistance by coolly clipping into the bottom corner from Alvaro Morata's instinctive knockdown, ending a smart move that began with a quick free-kick.\nMorata's thumping header doubled Chelsea's lead before the break, the Spaniard gleefully finishing from Cesar Azpilicueta's perfect cross.\nEverton did not get a sight of goal until Sandro's poor scuffed shot was deflected wide shortly after the break, a move that was only started by Azpilicueta's mistake.\nIn truth, Chelsea really ought to have scored more; Victor Moses shot straight at Jordan Pickford when played through, and Pedro drove just wide after nutmegging Gylfi Sigurdsson on the edge of the box.\nThe Toffees, playing their third tricky away game in seven days, have now failed to win in their past 23 league matches at Stamford Bridge.\nFor Chelsea, this was the perfect follow-up to last weekend's impressive victory over Tottenham at Wembley.\nRelive Chelsea's win over Everton\nBetter late than never\nAfter suffering a shock defeat by Burnley on the Premier League's opening weekend, Chelsea needed a performance that was more in tune with the home form of last season's title win.\nThey got it. Right from the outset there was an intensity to their passing, movement and pressing that was only matched by the animated Antoino Conte's cajoling on the sidelines.\nEverton, perhaps fatigued having followed their draw at Manchester City on Monday with Europa League progression at Hajduk Split on Thursday, could not hold them back for long.\nMorata was the only Chelsea player on the pitch who had been slow to make an impression, but he reacted impressively, after Ashley Williams blocked his initial pass, to set up Fabregas perfectly for a richly deserved opener.\nThe former Real Madrid striker looked to be struggling with the physicality and pace of the opening stages, but in scoring his header he became the first player in Premier League history to both score and assist a goal in each of his first two home games.\nThe reigning champions of England's top division have never lost their opening two home fixtures of a top-flight season, and by the time Morata was roundly applauded as he was replaced by Michy Batshuayi, Chelsea were heading for a straightforward victory.\nEverton limit damage but rarely threaten\nThree away games in seven days was never going to be easy, no matter the opposition, but Everton barely troubled Thibaut Courtois. It wasn't until the 87th minute that Chelsea's keeper was forced into making a save - from Idrissa Gueye's shot that appeared to be going over the bar.\nHaving been soundly outplayed in the first half, the second period felt more like damage control.\nMuhamed Besic, whose father was shot in his native Bosnia on Saturday, replaced the disappointing Tom Davies at the break, but Aaron Lennon, making his first league appearance since February, had more impact from the bench.\nHis cross caused momentary panic in a Chelsea box that had seen very little action, before Williams glanced just wide from Sigurdsson's cross in the closing stages.\nThere were positives - notably Mason Holgate's composed display after his mistake at City on Monday - but Everton are clearly still feeling the absence of Romelu Lukaku.\nWayne Rooney, Sigurdsson and Sandro never really combined convincingly, and Rooney appeared to let frustration over a first-half Marcos Alonso challenge affect his game.\nThe 31-year-old was finally shown a yellow card for dissent towards the end of a game he and his team-mates will want to forget.\nThe Toffees have never won a Premier League game in which they've been two or more goals behind at the break, a run that now stretches into four draws and 55 defeats.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nEverton's seven touches in the box - the stats\nEverton had three touches in opposition box before the 85th minute in this match - in the final five minutes (and injury time) they had four.\nEverton have conceded 10 goals against Chelsea under Ronald Koeman, more than twice as many against any other opponent during his tenure.\nEight of Alvaro Morata's 17 league goals since the start of 2016-17 have been headers (47%).\nBoth his Chelsea goals have been scored with his head and both assists have been headed passes.\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte told BBC Sport: \"We must be pleased with the performance. We played a really good game. We dominated and had plenty of chances.\n\"The only negative thing is we should be more clinical. But there were a lot of positive things.\n\"There are maybe four or five days to go before the close of the transfer market. I think the club is trying to work very hard to improve the squad. I need to rotate my players - for that I need a good number of players. I'm sure the club are trying to do their best.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \"The quality of our opponent made it really tough, but I'm still disappointed at our first half. I was proud of how we fought until the end. We made a lot of mistakes in the first half. They were more aggressive.\n\"If you have a few games in a short amount of time with a lot of travelling, it's hard to do with 11 players. We need a striker more to bring in. Sandro needs to adapt to the Premier League. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is only 20. You can't do a whole tough season with different competitions, you need one more striker.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea next play in the Premier League away to Leicester on Saturday, 9 September (15:00 BST), after the international break.\nEverton also next play in the league on 9 September, at home to Tottenham (15:00)."

You look at the money that Stoke have invested and they are a good side. We wanted Kurt Zouma but couldn't afford that loan fee.\n\"That's eight or nine games I have managed against Stoke and I am unbeaten. The game here, we were the better team. It's been a great start to the season.\"\nOn deals before the transfer window \"The chairman has just come in and we are hoping we can bring the players in we need. We have specific areas, and specific players.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We have gone behind against the run of play and showed good character to come back. We were the team that was pushing to the end. It wasn't a high quality game - a poor game, I have to admit. But you have to stick with it. I was pleased we were able to show that mentality.\n\"The conditions took the edge off both sides. Warm day, long grass, no water on the pitch. At the end we will take the point. In my view we should have had a penalty for a handball but the referee disagrees.\"\nHughes also hinted at a few new faces before the transfer window closed adding: \"The group could have maybe do with one or two to add to the quality we have. We will try.\"\nCrouch ahead of the rest - the stats you need to know\nThis was West Brom's first Premier League draw at The Hawthorns since October 2016 (1-1 against Tottenham)\nTony Pulis is yet to lose a Premier League game against former side Stoke (W5 D2)\nJay Rodriguez netted his first Premier League goal for West Brom and his second in all competitions, having scored against Accrington in the EFL Cup in midweek\nRodriguez has scored three Premier League goals against Stoke - against no side has he scored more (also three against Newcastle)\nOnly six players have scored more Premier League goals as a substitute than Peter Crouch (13)\nIt was Crouch's 51st headed Premier League goal, more than any other player.

        "article_text": "Liverpool 4-0 Arsenal\nLiverpool produced a dazzling attacking display to destroy Arsenal as Arsene Wenger's side were humiliated at Anfield.\nWenger surprisingly chose to leave out summer signing Alexandre Lacazette, and the \u00a352.6m striker could only look on as every one of the Gunners' old, familiar failings were brutally exposed by Liverpool's pace, movement and sheer desire.\nRoberto Firmino headed in Joe Gomez's cross to give Liverpool a 17th-minute lead to start an attacking blitz that ended in a final scoreline that actually flattered Arsenal.\nFollow reaction to the game here\nSadio Mane curled in Liverpool's second before Mohamed Salah ran half the length of the field on the break to stroke home the third after 57 minutes. The fact that the goal came from an Arsenal corner merely emphasised the shambolic nature of their display, which lacked organisation, commitment and passion.\nArsenal - who have now lost two of their first three league games - were overrun and showed no stomach for the fight. Liverpool substitute Daniel Sturridge gave the scoreline a more realistic appearance when he headed home the fourth at the far post from Salah's cross 13 minutes from the end.\nHave Liverpool found Suarez's replacement?\nLiverpool struggled to find the fire and verve that almost took them to the Premier League title in 2014 after their inspiration and talisman Luis Suarez left for Barcelona.\nThe fear factor Suarez possessed disappeared and in many respects it signalled the beginning of the end for Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager.\nCould it be that Mane has provided that crucial missing link in a Liverpool attack that now carries enough pace and movement to trouble any defence in the game?\nThe 25-year-old Senegal striker had a fine first season at Anfield following his \u00a334m move from Southampton in summer 2016, although his impact was reduced by injury and absence at the Africa Cup Of Nations, which hurt Liverpool's season.\nThis season, in combination with Firmino and new boy Salah, he is moving into the highest class and performing in a manner that is drawing comparison with Suarez.\nMane's goal was a typical piece of work, cutting inside from the left before placing a perfect right-foot shot low past Petr Cech.\nHe possesses the 'X Factor' of unpredictability without Suarez's unpalatable excesses, as well as lightning pace and tactical discipline. Mane will be crucial to Liverpool's season.\nMane may not yet be in the exalted class of Suarez when he was at Liverpool - but he is certainly looking like the closest they have had since the departure of the brilliant but temperamental Uruguayan.\nWhy would Sanchez stay at Arsenal?\nWenger insists Alexis Sanchez, who made his first appearance of the season, will not be sold before Thursday's transfer deadline - but that is unlikely to stop Manchester City making one final attempt to prise the Chilean away from Emirates Stadium.\nSanchez has shown no inclination to sign a new contract at Arsenal so Wenger's decision means the Gunners now risk losing an asset worth at least \u00a350m for nothing at the end of this season.\nThe brutal question after Arsenal's ambitions were laid bare once more is: what is there on offer in terms of serious success that would keep him at Arsenal?\nLiverpool looked light years ahead of Arsenal as potential title contenders, and with no Champions League football, there was very little that was appetising enough to tempt Sanchez to stay.\nSanchez was even denied the assistance of Lacazette, who was reduced to the role of substitute while Arsenal were subjected to the sort of hammering they have received at Anfield on a couple of occasions in recent seasons.\nIt is now a question of whether Arsenal stick or twist in the next few days - and whether a huge offer from City might just be tempting.\nIn a further irony, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who looks certain to leave Arsenal before the transfer deadline, was warmly applauded by Liverpool's fans when he was substituted, clearly in the hope he could be tempted to Anfield rather than Chelsea.\nKlopp and Wenger make big calls\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Arsenal counterpart Wenger both made big selection decisions before kick-off for one of the big early-season games.\nKlopp decided to \"rest\" goalkeeper Simon Mignolet - although no-one was quite sure what he was being rested for - and replaced him with young German Loris Karius, while Wenger produced an equally big surprise by leaving out Lacazette.\nLiverpool's only anxious moments came via Karius' uncertainty with the ball at his feet, the keeper twice almost caught in possession by Danny Welbeck but getting lucky as the ball bounced to safety.\nArsenal were so abject in attack that he was not tested in any other way - although the buzz of anxiety that whipped around Anfield when he had the ball at his feet sounded a note of concern for Klopp.\nThe Reds were again without Barcelona target Philippe Coutinho, who has a back injury - although they did not miss him.\nLacazette - who came on for the final 28 minutes - was probably best being kept out of this one, as Arsenal were swept aside by a red tidal wave of attacks. But it is a mystery why Wenger would spend big money on a player then leave him out for such a vital game.\nArsenal's other summer signing, defender Sead Kolasinac, the man who was supposedly going to beef up a soft side, was also excluded on a chastening day that left Wenger facing familiar and painful questions.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nAnalysis - 'Arsenal need freshening up'\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage at Anfield:\nLiverpool haven't beaten Arsenal, they have destroyed them. Thumped them. Torn them apart.\nIt doesn't matter what formation you play or your tactics, it's also about desire and winning second balls. I don't think enough Arsenal players want to play that kind of football.\nWhere are the leaders on the park for Arsenal, getting the likes of Xhaka and Monreal by the scruff of the neck and demanding to know what they are doing?\nIf I was an Arsenal fan I'd want to see my manager. Arsene Wenger and Steve Bould are simply sitting there doing nothing. Get out there and give your team a rollocking.\nTalk about body language. Think of the Arsenal teams of the past - leaders like Adams, Keown and Bould.\nThat was one of Liverpool's very best performances in a number of years. The midfield controlled the game with the pace and power of Wijnaldum, Can and Henderson combined with the pace of the attacking threat of Salah, Firmino and Mane.\nIt was almost perfect as a performance and it could easily have been more.\nFormer Arsenal striker John Hartson on Radio 5 live's 606\nLiverpool won every battle today for the entire game. If you get the better of your opposing man, then usually the team will win. I cannot think of any area where Liverpool lost out.\nWhen you travel to a notorious place, Anfield, mentally you've got to be prepared for a tough game, you've got to be prepared to run back, to tackle and to earn the right. Arsenal did not earn the right - they were lacking all over the pitch.\nBlame Arsene Wenger all you want but if the Arsenal players cannot muster up some fight then there must be something seriously wrong at the football club.\nI would have liked to have seen Wenger leave at the end of last season after winning three FA Cups in four years. He'd have left with the respect of the crowd and with his head held high.\nThe club needs freshening up.\nReaction - 'Simon is the number one'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \"After midweek games you have to reach the mountain immediately. You really feel it is intense, we wanted to force ourselves to be strong physically and that is what we were. We were really well organised.\n\"If you give Arsenal space and time you lose before the game starts so I don't think they could do a lot of what they wanted, Arsenal, and that is all credit to the boys because they worked really hard.\"\nOn the decision to rest Simon Mignolet: \"It is a completely normal decision. We want to have three strong goalkeepers. Simon is always spot on, always really good, a smart guy, he is a machine, he is the number one.\n\"But when you have three you have to give Simon a rest. He was not overly happy. He did not ask for the rest, but it is a mental rest more than a physical rest.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We put [the players] in ideal conditions, I think overall the performance from back to forward was not at the level requested and it raises many questions.\n\"I still believe you have to think these players are good enough but it is sure that today we were not at the level.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth clubs have almost a two-week break because of the upcoming international fixtures, with their next games coming after the transfer deadline.\nLiverpool visit Manchester City on Saturday, 9 September (12:30 BST), with Arsenal hosting Bournemouth at 15:00 BST.\nThe stats you need to know - more Gunners woe at Anfield\nThis was Arsenal's heaviest Premier League defeat since a 4-0 loss at Southampton on Boxing Day 2015.\nFour of Arsenal's eight Premier League defeats by a margin of 4+ goals have come against Liverpool at Anfield.\nOnly West Ham (10) have conceded more Premier League goals this season than Arsenal (eight).\nArsenal did not attempt a single shot on target in this match - the first time they have not had one in a Premier League game since 5 October 2014 (v Chelsea).\nLiverpool have kept four clean sheets in a row at Anfield in the Premier League for the first time since September 2013.\nArsenal have lost nine of their past 14 Premier League away matches (W4 D1 L9) - their previous nine away defeats in the competition came over a period of 47 games (W25 D13 L9).\nLiverpool's third goal (Mohamed Salah) came only 12 seconds after Arsenal took a corner.\nRoberto Firmino has scored and assisted in a game on eight occasions since his Premier League debut in August 2015; no player has done so more often than him in this period (Costa & Lukaku also on eight).\nSadio Mane is only the third player to score in the first three Premier League games of a season for Liverpool (after Robbie Fowler in 1994-95 & Daniel Sturridge in 2013-14).\nMane has scored in all three of his Premier League appearances for Liverpool against Arsenal."

The way we concede the goal is not Wembley. It's because of us.\"\nSpurs had looked on course for victory after Dele Alli put them ahead with a calm finish after Ben Mee fluffed a clearance from a corner.\nHarry Kane twice went close for Tottenham as they looked to make the result safe - only to curl the ball wide from a good position and see a shot well saved by Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal.\nHowever, Wood ensured the Clarets left with a point when he latched on to Robbie Brady's pass and slotted the ball past Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in the second minute of added time.\nTottenham's Wembley woes continue\nMuch has been made of Tottenham's struggles at the new Wembley and they have now won just twice in 12 matches at the rebuilt national stadium.\nPochettino's side again lacked much of the intensity which characterised performances in their final season at White Hart Lane when they went unbeaten.\nPerhaps the size of the Wembley pitch - which Tottenham had a request to make smaller turned down by the Premier League\n, external\n- is a factor in being unable to reproduce that kind of high-octane approach.\nThe atmosphere, inevitably, is also noticeably more subdued at their temporary home, compared to the cauldron feel generated inside their old ground.\nAfter taking the lead, Spurs, who lost 2-1 to Chelsea in their opening home game of the season, should really have put the contest to bed.\nBut as the match reached the latter stages they sat deep, looked nervous against a sustained spell of late pressure, and were duly punished by Wood.\nThe draw ensured Tottenham's wait for a home victory will be prolonged until at least mid-September.\nDream start for Wood\nBurnley paid Leeds United a club record \u00a315m for Wood and the New Zealand striker repaid the first part of that with a goal on his league debut for the Clarets.\nThe 25-year-old scored 44 goals in 88 appearances for Leeds after joining the Championship side from Leicester City in July 2015.\nWood played previously in the Premier League with Leicester and West Brom but never really convinced he was quite up to the required level.\nHe had previously scored just once in the top flight before this encounter for Leicester against Everton in August 2014 making this his first Premier League goal for 1107 days.\nThe clinical manner in which he took his goal at Wembley, after coming on as a 57th-minute substitute, indicated that perhaps he has developed into a player ready to grab his chance this time around.\n\"The Premier League is a lot different from the Championship,\" Wood said after the match. \"There are more good players who can carve you up. It is nice to be back. It is where my dreams and ambitions lie.\"\nThe powerful striker might not be the quickest player in a league where pace is seen as being a key attribute but Wood has plenty of other qualities to become a key figure for Sean Dyche's side following the sale of Andre Gray.\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski (Burnley)\n'We need to stay clam and work hard' - reaction\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said: \"The feeling is not so great because of the way we conceded the last goal. That is football. It was a tough game. Difficult for us to play. We had the chance to score a second or third but we missed. Sometimes you pay.\n\"It is true we concede against Chelsea and the same again today. We need to stay calm and work hard and be more focused to the end.\n\"This is only the beginning of the season. It is better it happens now. The only way to fix conceding is to work hard during the week. When everyone is back from the international break we will do that.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said: \"There is a lot made of the stadium but they remain a good side.\n\"They got a goal from a scruffy situation but we rose after that and we were terrific.\n\"We needed something. Sometimes the game pans out how you want but we thought if we could keep it tight and affect it from the bench that might work for us. The fitness of my players was terrific. They were strong at the end and got the goal.\"\nKane unable to break August hoodoo - the stats\nTottenham's Harry Kane has failed to score in every Premier League match he has played in August (13 games), despite attempting 42 shots in those games.\nSpurs failed to beat Burnley in a home league game for the first time since October 1974.\nTottenham dropped their first points after going ahead in a league game since losing 2-1 to Chelsea in November 2016 - they had won 21 consecutive matches when taking the lead before this match.\nDele Alli has never ended on the losing side in a Premier League match in which he has scored.\nBurnley remain unbeaten away from home in the Premier League this season (W1 D1), the first time since 1973-74 they've avoided defeat in their first two top-flight away matches of a season.\nClarets striker Chris Wood has scored 29 league goals since the start of last season - only Sheffield United's Billy Sharp has scored more (34) in English league football in that time.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Tottenham travel to Merseyside on Saturday, 9 September (15:00 BST) to face Everton.

        "article_text": "'Liverpool's 5-0 loss to Man City must be put in context'\nLiverpool's bright start to the Premier League season came crashing down to earth from the heights of the scintillating win over Arsenal at Anfield to the depths of painful defeat at Manchester City.\nThe 5-0 loss - Jurgen Klopp's heaviest in almost two years at Liverpool and his joint worst defeat as a manager after losing 6-1 to Werder Bremen at Mainz in Germany - must be placed in context.\nLiverpool were reduced to 10 men when key forward Sadio Mane was sent off for a high challenge that saw Manchester City keeper Ederson taken off on a stretcher after 37 minutes and were also up against a City side that can be an irresistible attacking force.\nIt was, however, still a harrowing afternoon for Liverpool and Klopp, a hefty comedown from the euphoria of the champagne football that swept Arsenal aside.\nPep and I didn't think it was a red - Klopp\nGame was tight before Mane red - Guardiola\nWhat next for Philippe Coutinho, Virgil van Dijk and Alexis Sanchez?\nLiverpool's brutal reality check\nLiverpool deserved every bouquet that was thrown in their direction after their destruction of Arsenal - in fact, perhaps they did not get enough credit.\nThe Gunners' failings were picked over relentlessly almost to the detriment of a Liverpool display that was a flashback to the 2013-14 season when they almost brought the title to Anfield on a tidal wave of attacking football.\nLiverpool were high on optimism when they arrived at Etihad Stadium, buoyed by an impressive recent record against Manchester City and their own burgeoning confidence.\nThere were good signs early on but it was the cold showers of reality that were falling on Klopp and his players from leaden skies above Etihad Stadium.\nManchester City took real relish in dishing out heavy punishment to a side and manager that have troubled them in recent seasons and the second half was a chastening experience as the victory margin could have been even wider.\nKlopp, quite rightly after Liverpool's first Premier League defeat of the season, was quick to try to restore order and avoid over-reaction as he said: \"If City take too much confidence from this game they make a mistake, and if we lose confidence from this game we also make a mistake.\"\nIt is a message he will be keen to reinforce with his players before they face Sevilla at Anfield on their return to the Champions League on Wednesday, because this was a heavy hit on the day they hoped to re-affirm their title ambitions.\nLiverpool's defensive frailty exposed\nLiverpool will point to Mane's red card as the moment which threw the door fully open for Manchester City - but the defensive failings they have yet to fully address were being unpicked even before the Senegal forward's dismissal.\nWatford hinted at problems unresolved in the 3-3 draw at Vicarage Road on the opening weekend - and City's array of attacking talent was always likely to probe that soft underbelly even more forensically.\nLiverpool's defence was going to be tested even before they had to operate with a numerical disadvantage, but there has to be real concern at the manner in which they were constantly cut apart in the second half, 10 men or not.\nThe return of the journeyman Ragnar Klavan in place of Dejan Lovren underscored the need for reinforcements in central defence, although it would be harsh to place responsibility at his door when Liverpool's midfield offered little in the way of protection.\nSouthampton's Virgil van Dijk was Klopp's top priority in the summer transfer market, with Liverpool willing to smash their transfer record and pay around \u00a360m for the Netherlands defender.\nAs has been well chronicled, the deal failed after things got messy amid allegations of illegal approaches to the player, a subsequent Liverpool apology and withdrawal of interest - plus Southampton's refusal to sell.\nKlopp, and plenty will say this is to his credit, refused to pay money on cheaper imitations or second choices when his first pick was out of reach. It does not, though, cure a very immediate difficulty.\nLiverpool's performance at Manchester City not only illustrated why Klopp needs that figure of authority and leadership at the heart of his defence as a partner for Joel Matip but also why the club's owners FSG need to find a way to make Southampton change their position on Van Dijk in January.\nKlopp will also surely look at finding a way to make Andrew Robertson, signed from Hull City in an initial \u00a38m deal, a regular fixture in his side at left-back. The Scot showed his promise in the win against Crystal Palace at Anfield and he looks a better bet than the flawed Alberto Moreno.\nLiverpool's manager had Simon Mignolet back in goal after he was replaced by Loris Karius against Arsenal in a strange interlude, so there is currently an air of uncertainty around the rearguard unit.\nFormer England winger Chris Waddle, who watched the game at Etihad Stadium for BBC Radio 5 live, said: \"You've got to question the back four and the keeper of Liverpool - it could let them down during the season.\"\nIt is not a new problem and will be well known to sides like Manchester City and coaches like Guardiola. Klopp must address it.\nLiverpool's collapse comes as a surprise\nLiverpool were on the back foot and a goal down when Mane saw red - a situation exacerbated by Gabriel Jesus adding to Sergio Aguero's opener with a second for City before half-time.\nIt was still a shock to see the manner in which Liverpool capitulated so completely in a second half that City could easily have inflicted even more pain than a five-goal thrashing.\nKlopp's half-time change, substituting the dangerous Mohamed Salah for \u00a335m new boy Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, had no effect and City's substitute keeper Claudio Bravo was little more than a bystander, the odd clearance apart.\nLiverpool, on this occasion at least, lacked the stomach for the fight and looked utterly dispirited from the moment the second half started. It was certainly a tough introduction for Oxlade-Chamberlain, walking into a 5-0 loss after saying farewell to Arsenal with that 4-0 defeat at Anfield.\nThe whole performance, even before Mane's departure, disappointed Klopp.\nThe German appeared to be questioning Liverpool's self-belief as he said: \"I was really angry at half-time, not because of the result or red card. I was angry because I didn't see before the red card that we really understood that we could have got everything.\n\"The red card was a game-changer, but even though City were 2-0 up and we had 10 men, I couldn't believe we had no chance any more.\n\"I thought there was something to come but then the second half was not the biggest joy for any Liverpool fan and we say sorry for that.\"\nIt was also out of character given Liverpool's record against close rivals since Klopp arrived at Anfield. They have thrived on the greater challenges.\nThis was Klopp's first Premier League defeat away from home to one of last season's top seven, having previously boasted a record of played nine, won five and drawn four.\nHe will now hope this was simply a one-off aberration and Liverpool will revert to type as they begin the crucial Champions League campaign.\nLiverpool still have plenty to savour\nLiverpool and Klopp will be bitterly disappointed at what was ultimately a humiliating experience - but there is still much to excite all at Anfield.\nKlopp's squad must pass the physical and mental test of having a Champions League programme to fit into their calendar after enjoying rest periods last season when they finished fourth.\nIt will be a long, hard campaign and it remains to be seen how they will cope with the added demands on their squad.\nWhat is not in doubt is the exciting attacking quality that will surely make the Reds top-four contenders again this season and a danger to any team they face in the Champions League.\nKlopp is confident he can re-integrate Philippe Coutinho into Liverpool's squad despite the Brazilian's very obvious desire to be with Barcelona at the Nou Camp rather than Anfield.\nIf he is successful - and Coutinho has the incentive of a World Cup in Russia to inspire him - then Liverpool are likely to produce some of the most attractive attacking football on show in the Premier League.\nThe front three of Mane, Roberto Firmino and Salah is a potent combination of raw pace and high-class talent. If Klopp can fit Coutinho back in - and with Oxlade-Chamberlain as his latest option - then there are likely to be more good days than bad.\nKlopp's immediate task, as he said himself, is to make Liverpool forget the result but not the mistakes that made this 5-0 loss the grimmest statistic of his Anfield reign."

They did not score in six of their last eight league matches last season, a run that contributed to the sacking of Claude Puel in June, despite him guiding the club to an eighth-placed finish and the League Cup final.\nMauricio Pellegrino, who replaced Puel in the summer and then sold England striker Jay Rodriguez to West Brom for \u00a312m in July, will be hoping his team can quickly improve up front.\nMan of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford)\nRare win for Watford over the Saints - the stats\nWatford enjoyed a league win over Southampton for the first time in eight attempts (won one, drew three, lost four); their first since October 2008 (3-0 at St Mary's).\nSouthampton have failed to score in nine of their last 12 Premier League matches, including three of their four games so far in 2017-18.\nWatford have kept a clean sheet in three successive Premier League games for the first time since October 2016.\nThe Hornets have sealed successive Premier League away wins for only the second time, also doing so in December 2015.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure scored his 14th top-flight goal in his career, but this was his first from outside the box (Premier League and Ligue 1 combined).\nDaryl Janmaat's now scored three Premier League goals for Watford - all away from home. Before joining the Hornets, all three of his Premier League goals had come in home games (at Newcastle).\nWatford's seven goals in the Premier League this season have come via six different goalscorers - only Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 has scored more than once in the competition for them in 2017-18.\n'Very proud' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"They were better in the first half, especially with second balls and physically they were fresher than us. For me it was two soft goals that we have to try to avoid in the future. Second half we were much better but could not create.\n\"We have to keep trying, I have confidence in my squad, I think we will improve and we will have to keep going.\"\nOn his side's failure to score for a fourth time in five matches: \"It is part of football, sometimes we don't have our day, like today. It is really difficult to create to score goals, but we have to keep going. I am confident we can improve.\n\"Watford had a lot of people behind the ball. We have to push on and keep working.\"\nWatford manager Marco Silva: \"It is really pleasing, and I am really proud of what we did.\n\"Congratulations for our team and our fans, they created a fantastic atmosphere and we deserved the win. It is not easy to come here and play how we played and control it how we did. We put pressure on the opponent, I do not remember a clear chance for them.\n\"The players work every day and this commitment and attitude means we can enjoy the match.\n\"Three clean sheets in a row is very important and gives the team confidence, but we played at times with a lot of quality and deserved the three points as we were stronger than our opponents.\n\"If you analyse the matches, we have had a lot of problems, we have used six centre backs and that is not normal, but we have kept three clean sheets. It is a very good start but we need to continue in this way.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton visit Crystal Palace in the early Premier League game on Saturday, 16 September (12:30 BST), before Watford entertain Manchester City at 15:00 BST.\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-0 Bournemouth\nDanny Welbeck scored twice as Arsenal returned to winning ways and condemned winless Bournemouth to a fourth successive defeat.\nThe Gunners came into the game on the back of two costly defeats by Stoke and Liverpool, but made the perfect start when Welbeck headed them in front after six minutes.\nRecord signing Alexandre Lacazette doubled the lead on 27 minutes, bending a shot past Asmir Begovic from the edge of the area.\nWelbeck than added a third just after half-time, scoring from a tight angle into Begovic's far corner.\nAlexis Sanchez, who was close to joining Manchester City on transfer deadline day, started the day on the bench, but came on for Welbeck with 15 minutes remaining.\nThe Cherries failed to register an attempt in the first half and Jermain Defoe's header against the post after half-time was the best it got for the visitors.\nArsenal were reduced to 10 men for the final 10 minutes, when substitute Francis Coquelin was forced off with a hamstring injury but Bournemouth failed to take advantage.\nEddie Howe's side are only off the bottom of the Premier League on goal difference and have lost their opening four games in a season for only the third time.\nRelive Arsenal's easy win against Bournemouth\nGunners find home comforts\nArsene Wenger's side were woeful in a 4-0 defeat at Anfield two weeks ago, which followed a 1-0 loss at Stoke.\nThen came the final week of the transfer window, which saw a failed bid for Monaco's Thomas Lemar and left the club clinging on to Sanchez, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain signed for Liverpool.\nThe home fans needed a performance and were treated to a clinical one as the Gunners cruised against a poor Bournemouth side.\nWenger set up his team with a back three of Laurent Koscielny, Shkodran Mustafi and Nacho Monreal, who restricted the visitors to just two shots on target in the whole game.\nWing-back Sead Kolasinac led the attacking efforts in the first half, getting forward at every opportunity and providing the cross for Welbeck's opener.\nAlmost half of Arsenal's play came down the left side of the pitch in the first 45 minutes, while right wing-back Hector Bellerin was crucial to the second half, running down his wing on the counter-attack, tipping the balance in favour of the right.\nMesut Ozil, Granit Xhaka and Ramsey all played like they had a point to prove, while Welbeck and Lacazette started to show signs of a handy partnership.\nSuch was the performance that Wenger did not need to introduce Sanchez until late in the game and when he did come on, the Chilean looked desperate to get on the scoresheet.\n\"Sanchez will win the fans back, and win them back very quickly,\" Wenger said.\nThe loss of Coquelin on 81 minutes might have usually caused some anxious moments, but Arsenal saw out the game in a professional manner.\nCherries' performance a cause for concern\n\"You can get bad results in the Premier League, but when you don't have performances, that's where concerns creep in,\" Howe said.\nThe Cherries' performance was definitely found wanting at the Emirates.\nHowe's side had been only narrowly beaten by Manchester City two weeks ago, with Raheem Sterling scoring a 97th-minute winner.\nBut they were barely in the game against Arsenal.\nThe Cherries have become only the ninth team to lose their opening four games in a Premier League season, although four of the previous eight have managed to avoid relegation.\nIn defence they toiled against Arsenal's attack, looking unorganised - their efforts summed up when Begovic made a mess of Tyrone Mings' backpass, almost allowing Welbeck and then Lacazette another opening.\nThey had Begovic to thank for keeping the scoreline respectable, saving a curling Ozil free-kick in the first-half and a good stop from a Giroud shot in the second half.\nThe real worry for Howe will be his side's attack, with the team having scored just one league goal this season.\nEngland striker Defoe had just one touch inside the Gunners' box all game and managed just 16 touches in total.\nJoshua King, who scored 16 league goals last season, was restricted to just one shot on target.\nThe most worrying statistic of all is that Bournemouth did not have their first shot on target until the 85th minute.\nMan of the match - Danny Welbeck\nWhat they said\nBournemouth striker Jermain Defoe: \"A disappointing performance, we are not happy. We can give so much more than that.\n\"The next game is massive for us. We believe we can perform. It is not for the want of trying, we prepare right. Sometimes when your confidence is low nothing seems to go your way and hopefully it will turn.\n\"We have to be men and stand up and be counted. We can only do it together.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"That was nowhere near where we need to be.\n\"We are not creating chances, we are giving up too many chances and we are not passing the ball well.\"\nThe stats you need to know - Lacazette's quick start\nArsenal have won their last seven Premier League games at the Emirates, their longest such run at home since April 2015 (nine successive wins).\nLacazette became only the second Arsenal player to score in his first two home Premier League games for the club, after Marouane Chamakh in 2010.\nWelbeck has scored three goals in four Premier League games this season, having scored just two in 16 appearances in the competition last term.\nThis was only the second time Danny Welbeck has both scored and provided an assist in a Premier League game for Arsenal, with the other being at Aston Villa in September 2014.\nKolasinac has delivered two assists in his three league games for Arsenal so far, with both being provided for Welbeck.\nThe Gunners have won by at least a two-goal margin in all four of their previous home meetings with Bournemouth in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal venture into the Europa League, hosting German side FC Koln on Thursday, before a game at Premier League champions Chelsea next Sunday.\nBournemouth will hope to bounce back at home to Premier League new boys Brighton on Friday."

        "article_text": "Harry Kane: Tottenham striker delighted with 'lucky' 100th goal in win over Everton\nHarry Kane admitted his 100th goal for Tottenham was a fluke but was delighted to reach the milestone in his side's ruthless 3-0 win over Everton at Goodison Park.\nThe forward reached his century with the first of Spurs' three unanswered goals on Saturday - an attempted cross from the right that looped over home keeper Jordan Pickford and found the net.\nChristian Eriksen scored Spurs' second from close range before Kane sealed the game with his 101st goal - a neat finish, 47 seconds after the break.\n\"I got a lucky one but sometimes you need that,\" said Kane.\n\"It is fantastic. It has been a crazy few years and to get the 100th goal was amazing. Hopefully I can get a few more.\"\nIn truth, the game could have have ended 6-0 to a totally dominant away side, who now have seven points and have moved up to fifth in the table.\nFor Everton, after their loss at Chelsea in their previous game, this is another chastening defeat against a top-four side they aspired to match following a summer of heavy spending in the transfer market.\nRelive Tottenham's win at Everton\nFollow reaction to Saturday's football\nKane brings up his century\nKane has yet to score a Premier League goal in August, despite having 25 shots last month.\nCome September, he scores at the first time of asking in a top-flight game with his first shot of the month - an effort that was not even intended as a crack at goal.\nThe England striker now has four goals in two games since the end of August - having also scored twice against Malta for his country during the international break.\nKane's century of goals was amassed in 169 games.\nSpurs fire a warning to the rest\nAfter finishing second last season, Tottenham have been somewhat inconsistent at the start of this one, winning comfortably away at Newcastle but then dropping points at home as they continue to find their feet at Wembley.\nHowever, this performance, against a side with lofty aspirations of their own, shows that they once again mean business and that the consistency of their starting XI over the last three campaigns brings with it a fluency unrivalled by most in the division.\nOnce Mauricio Pochettino's side had found a foothold in the game, Everton were unable to get a look in. Kane's second goal essentially killed the contest, but it may as well have been over from the moment his first found the net.\nKane will rightly take the headlines, but this was a team performance, with Eriksen the creative force, topped by his own first goal of the season - a close-range finish after Pickford had palmed out Ben Davies' shot.\nThe Dane played in front of a back three made that much more assured by the presence of summer signing Davinson Sanchez.\nBefore the three goals, Eriksen fired wide and Moussa Sissoko had a goal-bound effort blocked in the box.\nAfter them, an unmarked and central Dele Alli air-kicked a cross from Kane, who later pulled a shot wide from inside the box.\nThe 3-0 scoreline was more flattering to Everton than Spurs.\nLots spent but plenty still to do for Everton\nThis was a brutal remainder for Ronald Koeman and Everton that spending lavishly on a host of high-profile players does not instantly result in a fluent, cohesive, incisive side.\nThere was endeavour from the home side, especially in the opening quarter with the score still at 0-0, but precious little guile in the final third.\nGylfi Sigurdsson and Davy Klaassen were marginalised, Sandro anonymous and, as an apt contrast to Kane's milestone, the industrious but ineffective Wayne Rooney became the second player in Premier League history to receive 100 yellow cards for a foul late in the game.\nEverton will have much better days than this and will no doubt challenge at the top end of the table - they have too much talent not to - but they will need to be patient and work hard.\nAs an indication of what this can bring, they need only look at the side who so brutally put them to the sword.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\n'We were too nice' - what they said:\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am disappointed. I thought the first 25 minutes was OK. We had some chances but after the lucky 1-0 down it was really difficult. We lost control in the game. Tottenham's midfield diamond was difficult to control.\n\"Straight away in the second half the third goal killed the confidence in our team and Tottenham grew even more.\n\"The frustration is the second half. I don't ask for yellow or red cards but in several situations we were too nice. We were too nice, too weak in the second half but that is also something about confidence.\n\"I know how it works in football. If you sign some players they are losing a bit being realistic. Everyone is talking Everton top six but if you know the qualities of the players in the top six it is a challenge. We have enough games coming up to have a good reaction.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a fantastic performance. Very solid. We played really well against a very good team that is difficult here at Goodison Park.\"\nOn Harry Kane scoring his 100th and 101st Tottenham goals: \"It was fantastic for him to find the net again. It is fantastic for him and the team, I have no doubt about him. It was a very short few games without scoring but he is a great, great striker.\"\nAnother September launch for Kane - the stats you need to know\nKane, who has failed to score in his 13 Premier League appearances during August, has now scored in his first game in September in each of the past two seasons.\nTottenham have won four successive away games in the Premier League for the first time since January 2014 (five in a row).\nChristian Eriksen is now the joint-highest scoring Dane in Premier League history, with 32 goals (level with Nicklas Bendtner).\nEverton are winless in their past 10 Premier League games against Spurs (D5 L5), since a 2-1 win in December 2012.\nTottenham have won their past seven Premier League games in September, scoring 16 and conceding just two.\nWayne Rooney is the second player in Premier League history to receive 100 yellow cards after Gareth Barry (119).\nWhat next?\nEverton are in action in the Europa League, with a trip to Italian side Atalanta on Thursday (18:00 BST). Their next league game is at Manchester United the following Sunday (16:00).\nTottenham host Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League at Wembley on Wednesday (19:45) before returning to Premier League action next Saturday in a 17:30 kick-off at home against Swansea."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 1-2 Chelsea\nN'Golo Kante says he did not celebrate after scoring against Leicester out of respect for his former side, as Chelsea beat the Foxes to climb into the top three.\nBoth sides struggled to find a finishing touch before Alvaro Morata nodded in Cesar Azpilicueta's searching pass to put Chelsea ahead before half-time.\nThe visitors pressed home their advantage after the break as former Foxes midfielder Kante, gifted time and space, drilled home low from 30 yards.\nIn contrast to fellow ex-Leicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater, who received a mixed reception after his deadline-day move to Chelsea, Kante had earlier been warmly received by the Leicester crowd.\n\"It is always special to play my old team. I had an amazing year here but when I come I try to win,\" said Kante, who was part of Leicester's title-winning side.\n\"It is always a pleasure to score but I keep my celebration inside because I want to respect my old team.\"\nChelsea appeared to be cruising to the points after Kante's strike but a foul by Thibaut Courtois saw Leicester awarded a penalty that Jamie Vardy converted, sparking the hosts into life in a frenetic final half-hour.\nBut it was Chelsea substitute Willian who came closest to adding to the scoring with a curling strike just wide of the post.\nLeicester, who slip to 17th, have now lost six of their last seven home games against Chelsea.\nAll the reaction from today's Premier League matches\nRelive Chelsea's win at Leicester\nChelsea end September blues\nPrior to this match, Chelsea had not won a Premier League away fixture in September in any of the last four seasons - but Antonio Conte's side have put in strong performances at the King Power in recent times.\nThey started brightly and dominated possession in the opening stages but the visitors' finishing left something to be desired.\nMorata was in the mix throughout the first half but was kept in check by Leicester captain Wes Morgan, who provided two crucial blocks in the box to deny him.\nThe Spaniard eventually got the best of their personal duel, peeling away from the veteran defender to guide a glancing header beyond Kasper Schmeichel from Azpilicueta's pinpoint pass.\nKante's strike against his former club - which Schmeichel, quite rightly, looked annoyed to have allowed past him - should have been the end of the match as a contest, but the visitors seemed to lose focus.\nCourtois' clumsy challenge on Vardy for the penalty handed Craig Shakespeare's men a lifeline, but they could not use the momentum of that goal to claim an equaliser.\nConte's introduction of Eden Hazard - returning after an ankle injury - and new signing Davide Zappacosta appeared to steady the visitors.\nZappacosta almost marked his debut with a goal after connecting with Hazard's cross, but it was fellow substitute Willian who had the best chance late in the game when he fired Hazard's pass low into Schmeichel's gloves.\n\"It was a tough game. They had a lot of chances but we fight and had some chances but we won and that is the most important thing,\" Kante added.\nLeicester fall short\nThis is the first time the Foxes have lost three of their opening four top-flight fixtures since 1994-95 - a campaign that ended in relegation.\nThere is still a long way to go this term but Leicester seem to lack cohesiveness in the middle of the park, and Shakespeare was no doubt rueing the absence of Adrien Silva from his plans after the \u00a322m midfielder's transfer from Sporting Lisbon missed the deadline by 14 seconds.\nWith Japan forward Shinji Okazaki missing with jet lag, Islam Slimani partnered Vardy up front but they were starved of possession in the first half.\nRiyad Mahrez's direct running created a good opening for Slimani that Courtois did well to save, but any confidence Leicester gleaned from that moment was swiftly erased by Morata's breakthrough goal shortly after.\nLeicester stepped back defensively and, after gifting Cesc Fabregas too much room in the first half, did the same to Kante in the second, and their former star player duly punished them from distance.\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante (Chelsea)\nMorata's head reaps rewards - the stats you need to know\nLeicester have lost 12 of their last 14 games against Chelsea in all competitions (W1 D1).\nSince the start of the 2014-15 season, Jamie Vardy has won more penalties in the Premier League than any other player (11).\nVardy has netted four goals in his last five Premier League appearances for the Foxes, including three in 2017-18.\nOnly Andrea Belotti (10) has scored more headed league goals in Europe's big five divisions since August 2016 than Alvaro Morata (9).\nAll three of Morata's goals and assists in the Premier League have come from his head (three goals, two assists).\nOnly Diego Costa (7) and Cesc Fabregas (6) had more goal involvements within their first four PL apps for Chelsea than Morata (5 - level with Eden Hazard).\n'The big moments are going against us' - what the managers said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"We must be delighted because we had a good performance. We played very well. We were in total control and could have scored more goals.\n\"The penalty changed the situation. They tried to push but despite this we had chances to improve the score. It is a good result and a good performance. After the international break it is not easy.\n\"Alvaro is improving a lot. It is important for strikers to score goals but also to be involved. We know very well the importance of Eden. He needs time to find his best. We must be patient and give him the opportunity but I am happy for him.\"\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare: \"The big moments are going against us at the moment. We had a chance and a minute later they go down the other end and score.\n\"We were disappointed and had to change our shape. The players applied themselves magnificently in the second half, on another day it might have gone our way.\n\"We said the first six games would be a challenge. We go again and have to dust ourselves down.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Azerbaijani side FK Qarabag in the group stage of the Champions League group on Tuesday (19:45 BST) before a big Premier League match at home to Arsenal on Sunday (13:30). Leicester's next outing is a league match at newly-promoted Huddersfield on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 3-1 West Bromwich Albion\nBrighton recorded their first top-flight win for 34 years as two goals from Pascal Gross helped them to an emphatic victory over West Brom.\nThe German's twin strikes and an effort from Tomer Hemed were also the first goals scored by Chris Hughton's side since their promotion to the Premier League.\nIt was an exemplary attacking display against a side who had only conceded one league goal in their first three matches this season.\nGross scored the opener just before the break when he converted Solly March's cross from close range. Three minutes after the restart the 26-year-old made it 2-0 when he drove forward before sending a tame strike past the reach of Ben Foster.\nAnd Hemed, who fed the pass for Gross' second, then had the favour repaid when he headed in an inch-perfect cross from the German.\nWest Brom rallied in the closing moments and broke Brighton's resistance when substitute James Morrison squeezed his shot past defender Shane Duffy on the line.\nRelive the action from the Amex Stadium\nBrighton end long wait for goal\nDealing with the basics first is of paramount importance to Seagulls boss Chris Hughton.\nAgainst the Baggies, his side nullified the right-wing threat of Matt Phillips while his centre-backs easily dealt with balls played up to the anonymous Salomon Rondon in attack.\nThey then set about trying to expose a usually water-tight West Brom defence. It looked like it would be a stalemate at the break before Gross - a summer signing from German second division side Ingolstadt - managed to guide a shot past a crowd for the home side's first goal of the campaign.\nGross would have been long odds to score and a ridiculous price to score two, but he managed that feat shortly after the break when he ran towards goal before shooting past Foster. The 34-year-old keeper should have done better.\nThe previously goal-starved Brighton fans were then treated to a third as Hemed, who valiantly held the line in attack, got in front of Jonny Evans to convert the former Germany youth midfielder's delivery.\nThe Baggies lacking bite\nThe perennial problem for West Brom is scoring - it is now only eight goals in their past 13 league games.\nRondon was once again poor with no efforts and a 41.2% passing accuracy, which is not ideal if your role is to bring others into play.\nManager Tony Pulis might have been encouraged with the cameos of new signings Kieran Gibbs and Oliver Burke. They came on in the second half and played a big part in the solitary Baggies goal.\nFull-back Gibbs crossed to the far post for Burke who then nodded back across goal for another substitute Morrison to fire in - although defender Shane Duffy did his best to stop the shot with his hand.\nScotland international Morrison was close to grabbing a second, but saw his shot blocked by the alert Australia keeper Mat Ryan.\n'This was disappointing' - reaction\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"I think we thoroughly deserved it. The scoreline reflected the game. They were always going to put us under pressure.\n\"There were some really good performances. We're feeling a lot better now after our first win but we need to take this one forward.\n\"It's a good platform to build on but we are very conscious of how difficult this division is.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"You have to give Brighton credit. I'm not pleased with the way we played during certain stages of the game.\n\"If you're not at all in stages of the game, you will get beaten. It's disappointing.\"\n\"We conceded three poor goals. We had a lot of possession to have created more too.\n\"Everybody has to deal with the international break but some of our players turned up on Thursday afternoon and they looked like it.\"\nMan of the match - Pascal Gross (Brighton)\nShot-happy Brighton - the stats\nGross' 45th-minute opener was Brighton's first in the Premier League, and first in the top-flight since May 1983 when Gordon Smith scored against Norwich.\nBrighton had as many shots on target in this game (six) as they had in their first three Premier League games combined.\nThis was Pulis' first away defeat at a newly promoted club in the Premier League since his Stoke side lost 1-2 at QPR in May 2012. He had previously gone 11 games in a row unbeaten against newly promoted opposition.\nHemed is the first Israeli player to score a Premier League goal since Itay Schecter for Swansea against Wigan in May 2013.\nMorrison's goal was his 29th in the Premier League for the Baggies, putting him just one behind their all-time top scorer in the competition (Peter Odemwingie, 30).\nWest Brom recorded over 50% possession for just the 10th time in their 98 Premier League games under Pulis (W4 D0 L6).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton are away at fellow south coast club Bournemouth next Friday (20:00 BST) and West Brom are at home to West Ham next Saturday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 2-2 Manchester United\nEric Maxim Choupo-Moting scored twice as Stoke ended Manchester United's 100% start to the new Premier League season.\nSummer signing Choupo-Moting put Stoke ahead in the 43rd minute, powerfully finishing a fine team move for his first goal for the club.\nThat was the first goal United had conceded in 535 minutes of league football, a run stretching back to last season, but Jose Mourinho's side equalised less than three minutes later.\nPaul Pogba headed towards goal from a corner and the ball was inadvertently directed into the net off the back of Marcus Rashford's head.\nRomelu Lukaku put the Red Devils in front shortly after the break but Choupo-Moting levelled in the 63rd minute, heading in Xherdan Shaqiri's corner at the back post.\nAs both sides pushed for a winner, Lukaku wasted an excellent chance in the 81st minute when he fired over from Antonio Valencia's cross after losing his marker eight yards out.\nStoke goalkeeper Jack Butland then produced a brilliant reaction save to prevent an own goal in stoppage time.\nThe draw ends a run of three consecutive victories for United although they do return to the top of the table on goal difference from Manchester City.\nRelive the match as it happened\nDefensive mistakes cost United\nUnited have been free-flowing in their three victories so far this season, but on a ground where they have not won since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson they were again left frustrated.\nAs well as scoring 10 goals in their opening three games they had also also kept three clean sheets, and Mourinho may point to defensive errors as the reason for dropping their first points.\nFor the first goal, Mame Biram Diouf was given too much space to cross and Eric Bailly lost Choupo-Moting in the penalty area. For the hosts' second, Phil Jones stumbled to allow the Cameroon winger to head home unmarked.\nBut United had chances to win the game, with Lukaku's miss late in the second half a poor effort.\nRashford had two efforts saved in the first half by Butland and it would have been harsh on Stoke had the England goalkeeper been beaten in stoppage time through a deflection off Kurt Zouma.\nInstead Butland dropped low to his right to palm away the ball and secure a second successive draw that takes Mark Hughes' side up to 10th.\nChoupo-Moting provides finish for Stoke\nHughes has signed a number of flair players in recent years with varying degrees of success, but Choupo-Moting showed he could well be the clinical player Stoke have been searching for.\nThe 28-year-old, who joined on a free transfer following the end of his contract at Bundesliga club Schalke, was effective playing in a fluid forward line alongside Shaqiri and Jese Rodriguez.\nShaqiri had two strikes from distance smartly saved by David de Gea in the first half and Jese forced the Spaniard into a sensational save in the second period from point-blank range.\nFormer United pair Darren Fletcher and Diouf also impressed and each played a key role in the Potters' well-worked opener.\nFletcher found Diouf with an accurate cross-field before the wing-back's excellent early centre was swept home by Choupo-Moting.\n'I offered my hand but Jose didn't want to take it'\nMourinho and Hughes did not shake hands at full-time after the pair exchanged words earlier in the match.\nFormer United striker Hughes said: \"I'm not sure why he didn't want to shake my hand. I didn't think there were any issues.\n\"There was a time he came into my technical box and I told him to get out but that was it. Maybe that was what upset him.\"\nMourinho swiftly ended his post-match interview with the BBC after being asked about the incident.\n\"I prefer not to answer the question. Your question is a bad question,\" he said.\n\"It makes it look like it's my fault, my problem, and your question is not correct. I'm sorry.\"\nIt is understood Mourinho felt he had been insulted by Hughes after stepping into the Welshman's technical area.\nMan of the match - Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting\n'One team tried to win' - what they said\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"He [Choupo-Moting] will get the headlines and rightly so because he was a big part of the performance and the result overall.\n\"He should be pleased and I was delighted when I got him here. It was a decent bit of business.\n\"We were up against the best side in the Premier League judging by what they have shown so far. We didn't allow them as much space and everything I asked the guys to do, they fulfilled.\"\nManchester United Jose Mourinho: \"I'm not satisfied with a point because we were the team closer to winning. It is a result I accept, though.\n\"One team tried to win, one team tried to get the point but they fought hard to get that point - they defended well, they counter-attacked and in set-pieces they are powerful.\n\"That was a great save by David de Gea - the only one he did, because in the first half there was only a couple of slow shots by Xherdan Shaqiri.\n\"But we couldn't protect the corner and he was punished, we were punished.\"\nUnited missing Fergie in the Potteries - the best stats\nManchester United haven't won any of their five Premier League away games at Stoke since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 (D3 L2) - only at Chelsea, Tottenham (4 each) and Cardiff (once) have they failed to win in the league since the Scotsman left.\nChoupo-Moting's opener was the first goal Manchester United had conceded in 535 minutes of Premier League football, since Harry Kane's strike at White Hart Lane in May.\nOnly Wayne Rooney (15) scored more Premier League goals as a teenager for Man Utd than Rashford has (currently 12, same as Ryan Giggs).\nLukaku's strike was his 150th in club football (47 Anderlecht, 17 West Brom, 87 Everton and 5 for Manchester United).\nNo player has scored more goals in their first four Premier League games for Man Utd than Lukaku (4, same as Louis Saha, Robin van Persie and Zlatan Ibrahimovic).\nChoupo-Moting became the first player to open his Premier League goal account with a brace against Manchester United since Afonso Alves in April 2008.\nMark Hughes has become only the second manager to go unbeaten in four consecutive Premier League managerial clashes with Jose Mourinho, after Ronald Koeman (5 games).\n60% of Stoke's shots were taken by Chopou-Moting (6/10), who scored with both of his shots on target.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United host FC Basel in their Champions League opener on Tuesday (19:45 BST) before facing Everton at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday (16:00). Stoke meanwhile travel to St James' Park to face Newcastle in the league on Saturday (15:00)."

A combination of misfortune and good defending on the line prevented Dann scoring with two goalbound shots, but only the Palace defender knows what was going through his head when, with a minute to go, he tried to use it to steer home a cross from Yohan Cabaye from just yards out instead of burying it.\nDe Boer can lament an unjust defeat but it leaves him vulnerable in what, as his chairman dispassionately stated this week, is a \"results-based business\".\nBurnley building with Wood\nWood is already beginning to make the \u00a315m Burnley spent to bring him to Turf Moor look like good business.\nHe showed predatory instincts to grab his side a point in the closing stages against Tottenham at Wembley before the international break and was equally lethal when gifted a route to goal by Lee on Sunday.\nPrior to today the former West Brom and Leicester striker had never played more than 35 minutes in a Premier League match, managing only 11 substitute appearances, but after scoring 30 times for Leeds last season he now looks at home in the top flight.\nIt is fortunate for Burnley that he does, because they only managed one other shot on target over the whole 90 minutes on Sunday - a curling effort from Ashley Barnes that Wayne Hennessey palmed away.\nBut the Clarets' victory was a team effort and owed as much to their application and organisation at the back as the wastefulness of their opponents.\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski (Burnley)\n'Palace were better than us' - What they said...\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We were resolute, that was the key. Palace were the better side today - we didn't get into our stride at all.\n\"They played well throughout the game. Sometimes it's just not your day. It's our worst performance of the season so far but the shape of the team, the belief in each other, was on show.\n\"Chris Wood has made a good start and he scored a hat-trick for his country in midweek as well. He has a desire to prove himself in the Premier League. It was a great finish.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Frank De Boer: \"I cannot believe we lost. There is still frustration about the result but not about our performance.\n\"The goal we conceded was very disappointing. We have given a lot of sloppy goals away already and that was even worse.\n\"We did not give much away, controlled the game and you have to reward yourself by scoring goals. That is what football is about.\n\"I am not disappointed about the performance and it gives me a lot of hope for the future - I said straight after after to the boys that if you do like this you will get your goals and your rewards.\"\nGet rid of it! - the stats you need to know\nPalace have lost their past six Premier League games in which they've registered at least 60% possession.\nChris Wood is just the second player from Oceania to score in their first start in the Premier League - the other was Brett Emerton in August 2003 for Blackburn against Wolves.\nWood's strike was scored just 169 seconds into the match, Burnley's fastest Premier League goal since November 2016, also against Palace - Sam Vokes firing the Clarets ahead 78 seconds into that match.\nWood is the first Burnley player to score in both of his first two Premier League appearances for the club.\nWood became just the sixth player from New Zealand to start a Premier League match, after Ryan Nelsen, Winston Reid, Simon Elliott, Danny Hay and Lee Norfolk.\nThe Clarets are guaranteed to end today in the top eight of the top-flight outside August for the first time since April 18th 1975.\nWhat next?\nBurnley travel to Liverpool next Saturday for a Premier League game at 15:00 BST before hosting Wood's former side Leeds in the EFL Cup the following Tuesday night.\nPalace host Southampton in Saturday's early kick-off and then welcome Huddersfield to Selhurst Park in the EFL Cup on Tuesday."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 0-1 Newcastle United\nNewcastle United earned a second successive Premier League win as captain Jamaal Lascelles proved their match-winner in attack and defence at Swansea City.\nA soporific first half was enlivened by a flurry of late chances at both ends and a failed Newcastle appeal for a penalty after Mikel Merino appeared to dive under pressure from Alfie Mawson.\nTammy Abraham was a whisker away from giving Swansea the lead but, after he rounded visiting goalkeeper Rob Elliot, his shot was superbly cleared off the line by Lascelles.\nThe Newcastle centre-back then rose highest from a Matt Ritchie corner to score the game's only goal with a thumping header.\nA first away win in the Premier League since 2015 sees the Magpies climb up to 10th in the table, while the Swans slip to 15th after losing their opening two home league games of the season for the first time since 1985.\nRelive Swansea's match with Newcastle as it happened\nNewcastle win without Benitez\nNewcastle were without their manager Rafael Benitez on the touchline as the Spaniard recovered from surgery to deal with an infection from a hernia operation two years ago.\nHe had overseen a first win of the season in the previous game before the international break - a handsome 3-0 victory over West Ham - but his side initially struggled to reproduce that form in his absence.\nThe visitors eventually settled and Joselu's glancing header was brilliantly palmed away by Lukasz Fabianski, although Newcastle's goalkeeper Elliot also had to show sharp reflexes to deny Jordan Ayew.\nIn between those chances there was a moment which prompted howls of fury from both sets of fans as Merino fell under a challenge from Mawson and appealed in vain for a penalty, with replays showing the Spaniard had dived and was lucky not to be booked.\nIt was not the only significant refereeing decision of the match - Ritchie booked for a high challenge on Mawson that was similar to the tackle that saw Sadio Mane dismissed for Liverpool on Saturday.\nThe Merino incident proved to be academic as Newcastle grew in confidence and looked increasingly threatening in attack, with the breakthrough coming after 76 minutes as Lascelles evaded Mawson to power his header beyond Fabianski.\nThere was further good news for Newcastle as assistant manager Francisco de Miguel Moreno told BBC Sport that Benitez would return to the club later this week.\n\"He wanted to attend but the weather conditions were not the best,\" said De Miguel Moreno. \"He has been active in the game and kept in touch with us throughout the game.\n\"After the game, Rafa rang us and congratulated all the team because they did a fantastic job. He said 'we are now under way'.\n\"We need Rafa back as soon as possible. This week he will join us, probably on Tuesday.\"\nSwansea's new signings fail to fire\nSwansea handed a first start to Renato Sanches, the Portuguese midfielder who joined from Bayern Munich on a season-long loan on transfer deadline day.\nThere were high hopes for the 20-year-old, a former Manchester United target who had joined Bayern from Benfica for 35m euros last year, although it was a mixed beginning to life in south Wales for Sanches as he showed some neat touches but also misplaced several passes.\nHis display personified a disjointed encounter which failed to produce any action of note until the closing stages of the first half.\nAnother of Swansea's deadline-day arrivals, Wilfried Bony, was given a hero's welcome on his return from Manchester City but the Ivorian striker had little impact on the game when he came on as a second-half substitute.\nAlthough head coach Paul Clement had made the seemingly positive change from a 5-3-2 formation to 4-4-2 for this game, the Swans looked blunt in attack and, apart from Abraham's chance, seldom troubled their opponents.\nMan of the match - Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\nAnother Lascelles header - the stats\nSince the start of last season, no side in the top four tiers of English football has won more away league games than Newcastle (15, level with Chelsea and Exeter).\nThe Swans have lost their opening two home league games of a season without scoring a goal for just the second time in their history (1985-86).\nMatt Ritchie has registered an assist in all three of his Premier League appearances against Swansea (three in total).\nAll three of Jamaal Lascelles goals for Newcastle in the Premier League have been headers from a corner - with two of those coming against Swansea.\nJesus Gamez - aged 32 years and 152 days - became the second oldest Premier League debutant of 2017/18, behind Bruno of Brighton & Hove Albion (36 years and 314 days).\nNewcastle have failed to score in the first half of their last 14 away Premier League matches since Papiss Cisse scored against Crystal Palace in November 2015.\nSwansea have lost back-to-back home Premier League games under Paul Clement for the first time.\nThe Swans have faced 16 shots on target in home Premier League games this season, more than any other side; Newcastle, meanwhile, have fired in 13 shots on target in away Premier League games, with only league leaders Manchester United (16) having more so far this campaign.\n'A missed opportunity' - what they said\nSwansea manager Paul Clement told BBC Sport: \"I'm not very happy. The margin of the defeat was small and decided by a set play but we weren't at the level I expect.\n\"Our preparation was good and the atmosphere around the team was good. We were second best in lots of areas. We pushed to the end but never really created anything and Newcastle were better than us.\n\"Any system can be undone whether it is man-to-man or zonal. Both have strengths and weaknesses. It worked well for us last season. We have conceded two from corners this season so the details aren't right. We don't need to change how we defend, just go about our defending in a better way.\n\"It was a missed opportunity. We are a good side but we didn't execute today. At this level you have to do that. We have to move on quickly. We have a hard game at Tottenham next week and it is important we are better.\"\nOn Renato Sanches, Clement added: \"He has come to a new club and has new team-mates, a new language, new culture. He did things today that were good and some that weren't good. He is a quality player.\"\nNewcastle assistant manager Francisco de Miguel Moreno told Sky Sports: \"I feel very happy, very glad for the performance of the players.\n\"We expected them to play with five at the back and we realised it was four but everything was as planned. We tried to control their midfielders and attack down wide.\n\"Jamaal Lascelles has the spirit of a captain, without doubt. He manages everything so well and is involved in all situations.\"\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle play at home against Stoke City on Saturday, 16 September (15:00 BST), before Swansea play away at Tottenham in the late game on Saturday (17:30 BST)"

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-0 Huddersfield Town\nPedro Obiang's heavily deflected goal was the moment of luck West Ham needed to set them on the way to their first points of the Premier League season as Huddersfield suffered their first defeat.\nThe Hammers, whose manager Slaven Bilic was under pressure after three successive league defeats, were below par - although the visitors offered little threat.\nJavier Hernandez hit the bar in the first half, in one of West Ham's few clear-cut chances.\nThe breakthrough came in the 72nd minute when Obiang's 25-yard strike hit Mathias Jorgensen's back and looped over keeper Jonas Lossl.\nIt was the first goal that Huddersfield - or Lossl - have conceded in their first season back in the top flight.\nAnd the second came five minutes later when substitute Andre Ayew - whose introduction for Hernandez was booed by West Ham's fans - turned the ball home from three yards out.\nHuddersfield's major opportunity came with 10 minutes left as Thomas Ince hit the crossbar from the edge of the box.\nRelive the action from London Stadium\nBirthday boss Bilic eases some pressure with win\nBilic came into the game under plenty of pressure after the Hammers had conceded 10 goals in their opening three league games.\nAnd the Croat, celebrating his 49th birthday, has also had public disagreements with the club's owners over their failure to sign his key target William Carvalho, as well as Renato Sanches and Grzegorz Krychowiak.\nOn their first game at home this season - with London Stadium not initially ready following the World Athletics Championships - the Hammers did not look great.\nAndy Carroll made his first appearance this season following a thigh injury, with Mexico striker Hernandez having to move out to the wing to make space for the target man.\nHernandez was quiet - although Michail Antonio was excellent on the other flank.\nThe Hammers' finishing was poor - with Cheikhou Kouyate, James Collins, Jose Fonte and Antonio all squandering chances.\nAnd it looked as if criticism of Bilic would grow when the replacement of Hernandez with Ayew was met with boos from the home crowd.\nBut it was actually a match-winning substitution. Ayew set up Obiang's goal and then poked home after Fonte's shot from Aaron Cresswell's corner was blocked.\nHuddersfield brought back down to earth\nThe Terriers had enjoyed an excellent start to their maiden Premier League season, their first in the top flight since 1971-72, winning two and drawing one.\nPerhaps the international break came at a bad time because they put in their worst performance of the fledgling season.\nAgainst a team out of form, they did not play with the usual energy and dynamic attacking play they had shown so far under boss David Wagner.\nDespite having more of the ball and completing more passes, they only forced Joe Hart to make two saves, with both efforts from outside the box - via Philip Billing and Steve Mounie.\n'We were not good enough' - manager reaction\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner on BBC Radio 5 live: \"Unfortunately it was a deserved defeat. We were not good today especially with the ball.\n\"In defence we worked and fought, even if the goal was unlucky. We have to be honest that we were not good enough with the ball - not confident enough or brave enough.\n\"This is the Premier League and in the Premier League it is so difficult to keep clean sheets. We had the chance to keep one today. The goals were unlucky, but our performance was not good enough.\n\"If everyone was on it like [defender] Christopher Schindler was today, we would have had a better chance to get a result. We had seven or eight players not on it. We will learn from it.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am really pleased with how we acted in a difficult situation. After three defeats your confidence is a bit down but the lads did everything we asked from them.\n\"We had a game plan and from the first moment we were on the front foot. We stopped them from creating anything. We got our reward, a little bit lucky for the first goal but overall we deserved it.\n\"I said even if we did not win the game I would have been pleased with the performance of the guys because we had done everything.\n\"The first goal was at a crucial time because we had lost the momentum a little bit and that brought us back into a good zone.\"\nMatch facts - Hart ends clean-sheet drought\nWest Ham scored twice in this game, as many as in their previous four home league games combined.\nHuddersfield are the last team in this season's Premier League to concede a goal, after 342 minutes of action.\nThe Hammers have now kept four clean sheets in their past five top-flight home games.\nAndre Ayew has been directly involved in four goals in his past five Premier League games [a goal and assist v Huddersfield and a goal and assist v Burnley last May].\nAndy Carroll won 13 aerial duels in the game, the most of any player in a Premier League game this season.\nWest Ham scored with two of their three shots on target in the game.\nHuddersfield have won just two of their past seven away league games (D1 L4).\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham - who remain in the relegation zone on goal difference - visit West Brom on Saturday (15:00 BST). Huddersfield, who remain sixth, host Leicester City at the same time."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-1 Brighton & Hove Albion\nJermain Defoe scored a well-taken winner as Bournemouth came from behind to claim their first Premier League win of the season against Brighton.\nDefoe turned in the box and drilled home a clinical finish - his first goal since joining the Cherries in the summer - after being put through by substitute Jordon Ibe.\nWinger Ibe has struggled since arriving at Bournemouth from Liverpool for \u00a315m in 2016, but he also made the first goal with a clever backheel to Andrew Surman, who coolly stroked in.\nAfter a dismal first half, the game came to life in the second period as Solly March headed in the opener for visitors Brighton from Pascal Gross' pinpoint cross.\nMinutes earlier, defender Dale Stephens nodded an effort against the crossbar after Surman had cleared Shane Duffy's header and Davy Propper's follow-up off the line.\nThe two sides meet again at the Vitality Stadium on Tuesday in the third round of the EFL Cup.\nRelive Bournemouth's victory over Brighton\nIbe finally contributes\nUp until Ibe's introduction on 65 minutes in place of Ryan Fraser, the Cherries were largely poor, failing to break down a Seagulls backline which had been sitting deep.\nFull-back Charlie Daniels, who scored a stunner against Manchester City in the last league game, strode forward and struck a rising drive straight at Mathew Ryan, and striker Defoe came close when he spun and struck from the edge of the box.\nBut England Under-21 international Ibe, who provided no goals or assists in 25 league games last season, laid on two goals on Friday and almost got on the scoresheet late on with a free-kick that curled inches wide.\nThe pressure had been mounting on Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe after starting the Premier League campaign with four straight defeats, but the win moves them three points clear of bottom side Crystal Palace, who host Southampton on Saturday.\nHowe said of Ibe's contribution: \"He made a huge difference, the ability to beat people and be positive with the ball. The two assists were excellent and I am really pleased for him.\"\nGross looks pretty for Brighton\nThis was a meeting of two south-coast teams living a fairytale in the top flight of English football.\nIn 2008-09, Bournemouth were hit with a 17-point deduction after financial problems and they finished the season just two places above the relegation zone in League Two.\nBrighton's long climb to the Premier League came having finished 23rd out of 24 teams in the old Division Three - now League Two - in 1997-98. The previous season, they finished in the same position and on the same points as Hereford, but stayed in the Football League by virtue of having scored three more goals than the Bulls.\nChris Hughton's side were proving tough to break down early on against Bournemouth and managed to take the lead courtesy of Gross' cross to fellow midfielder March.\nGerman Gross, who created the most chances (98) in the Bundesliga for Ingolstadt last season, will be key if the Seagulls are to stay in the division, having been involved in all his team's goals this term - two goals and two assists.\nMan of the match - Andrew Surman (Bournemouth)\nAnalysis\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on BBC Radio 5 live\nGive credit to the Bournemouth players and manager.\nEddie Howe would have been very disappointed with what he saw in the first half. He let them come out in the second half and then decided to make a change. And Jordon Ibe made the difference - with two assists.\nYou can sense the relief around this stadium and on the players' faces with the celebrations - they'll feel they can kick on now. It shows good togetherness that they have come through this.\nTo be fair to Eddie Howe, he never veers away from how they play football. The reason it hasn't been going great is because individually they haven't been performing.\nBut winning and scoring goals breeds confidence. There'll be smiles on faces at training now and looking forward to their next games.\nI thought Brighton were cruising for 65 minutes. Chris Hughton will be disappointed.\n'A confidence lift' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to Match of the Day: \"A lot of emotions, relief is probably the biggest one. We have had a tough run of fixtures and today was really important.\n\"They played deep, they were compact and we knew it would be difficult. The two goals have given everyone a confidence lift.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Incredibly disappointed. They have a lot of quality and move the ball well, but we handled it well for a lot of the game. It was two poor goals we conceded that we never looked like conceding before then.\n\"I thought it was a really good period for us just before we scored. Up until then they had a lot of possession but I felt we were always in the game.\"\nJer-main man - the stats\nBournemouth extended their unbeaten run against Brighton to seven games (won four, drawn four).\nDefoe scored his first goal for Bournemouth since May 2001 (5,977 days ago), when he was playing alongside Howe for the Cherries at Reading.\nDefoe has now scored against 36 different Premier League teams. Only three players have scored against more - Frank Lampard (39), Andrew Cole (38) and Alan Shearer (37).\nDefoe has scored in 17 different Premier League seasons, with only three players scoring in more - Lampard (18), Paul Scholes (19) and Ryan Giggs (21).\nIbe is the first Bournemouth player to provide two assists in a Premier League game."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-1 Southampton\nCrystal Palace became the first club in top-flight history to lose their opening five games without scoring as Roy Hodgson's first match as manager ended in defeat by Southampton.\nThe Eagles paid for slack defending in just the sixth minute when a Dusan Tadic cross-shot was parried to the feet of Steven Davis, who side-footed home from 10 yards.\nPalace's direct approach was contained for the most part, though Saints keeper Fraser Forster did have to make point-blank saves to deny Christian Benteke and Jason Puncheon either side of half-time.\nHis resistance meant the hosts set a new top-flight record as they surpassed the 438 minutes Newcastle went without a goal at the start of the 2005-06 season.\nPalace did not offer enough and allowed the away side to keep possession too easily as they secured a first win since 19 August.\nSaints introduced Virgil van Dijk from the bench late on, the defender making his first appearance since declaring he wanted to leave in the summer.\nHis impact was minimal as his side easily saw out the closing stages, with Palace resorting to hopeful crosses and long balls, as they had for much of the afternoon.\nReaction: Hodgson fears 'even worse scenario'\nRelive Crystal Palace v Southampton here.\nDirect Palace lack cutting edge\nHodgson's appointment following the sacking of Frank de Boer failed to produce any notable increase in intensity or quality. In fact, Palace looked more threatening in De Boer's final game, a 1-0 defeat at Burnley.\nThe Dutchman had used a 3-5-2 formation in his opening three league games, switching to 4-3-3 at Turf Moor. Hodgson opted for 4-4-1-1, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek charged with playing close to Benteke.\nIt pointed a little to his days in charge of Fulham, where a pragmatic 4-4-2 proved hard to break down as he guided the Cottagers to safety against the odds in 2007-08.\nBut his side were anything but hard to get at in the early exchanges and Tadic easily found shooting space to allow Davis a tap-in for his first goal in 489 days.\nThe home side's brief seemed to be to play direct to Benteke, and it looked as though they would need a clever flick or fortunate bounce to create meaningful openings.\nAll too often their crosses were from deep, with Saints full-backs Ryan Bertrand and Cedric Soares rarely letting their rivals in behind them to deliver from dangerous areas.\nWhat can Hodgson build on?\nLoftus-Cheek was a positive for Palace - he fizzed an effort wide from range in the opening period and had a shot blocked by Bertrand after a powerful run. His late withdrawal prompted some booing.\nHe looks capable of delivering on his promise, and afterwards Hodgson pointed to the fact he also has key players such as Wilfried Zaha to return to his squad.\nSo there are plus points, and the atmosphere generated by Palace's fans before kick-off points to a fanbase which holds belief.\nWhile their sides' play looked limited, they did create two chances which on any other day could have found the net. Benteke and later Puncheon should have done better when somehow Forster denied them.\nPalace now join the Ipswich side of 1970-71 in going five games without a goal at the start of a season. But the Tractor Boys survived that season, a feat former Palace player Hodgson says he feels confident of replicating at Selhurst Park.\nHe acknowledged his new side \"didn't play well enough\" against Southampton but his belief in stating he will keep them up must now filter through to players. The fact their next three league games are against Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea will test the legitimacy of his claim.\nSaints build on solid foundation\nHodgson had his head in his hands during the first 45 minutes. Southampton, by contrast, may view this as a perfect day.\nVan Dijk's first appearance of the season will begin the process of putting his transfer saga behind him, and Mauricio Pellegrino's side looked organised throughout as they secured a third clean sheet in five league games.\nForster will take the headlines, but Wesley Hoedt and Maya Yoshida were an almost impenetrable central-defensive pairing, and were protected superbly by Mario Lemina.\nLemina had 97 touches, made five tackles and won possession 15 times - doing all three more than anyone else on the field.\nWith him and Oriol Romeu protecting the back four, and the energy Davis showed in running more than 12 kilometres, it appears they have the foundations on which to build a fine season.\nHow far they go may well come down to their ability in the final third. All too often, Saints found excellent crossing positions - particularly through Tadic down the right - but failed to find a good final ball.\nTheir play was neat and their desire to get the ball down clear. It proved enough, and doubts over the impact Pellegrino has made in succeeding Claude Puel will ease a little.\nMan of the match - Mario Lemina\n450 minutes and counting - the stats\nPalace are without a goal in 450 minutes this season, the longest run from the start of a Premier League campaign.\nThe Eagles have failed to find the back of the net in six consecutive league games for the first since January 1995 (a run of nine), with three different managers taking charge during this run (Sam Allardyce, Frank de Boer and Roy Hodgson).\nHodgson (70 years and 38 days) became the third manager to take charge of a Premier League game in his 70s after Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Bobby Robson.\nSteven Davis scored his first Premier League goal since 15 May 2016 - also against Palace 489 days ago.\nDavis has scored 15 goals in the Premier League. Only three other Northern Ireland players have netted more in the competition (Iain Dowie 33, Chris Brunt 24 and Keith Gillespie 17).\n'We didn't deserve a fairytale' - manager reaction\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson:\n\"We didn't deserve a fairytale ending. We didn't play well enough. After the goal you could see the nerves and the anxiety. The only comfort I could take is that we got better as the game went on. The players care and they hurt and you couldn't say they weren't trying.\n\"It wasn't a game with loads of chances but they had too much possession and we allowed that because we weren't compact enough.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"The first half was good, we created chances. In the second-half they pressed higher but generally we controlled the game. Our spirit in every single action from the beginning to the end was there.\"\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace host Huddersfield in the EFL Cup on Wednesday before travelling to Manchester City on Saturday, when Southampton will host Manchester United."

They went on to finish 11th that season, but this Rafa Benitez side are flirting with the top four.\nTheir stay there may well be brief, but after what appeared to be a summer of frustration and missed transfer targets for the Spanish boss, he will be delighted by the performance of the squad at his disposal.\nThe wonderful left foot of Ritchie laid on both goals for the hosts, with Atsu drifting in at the back post to poke home a well-weighted cross for the opener.\nCaptain Lascelles said after the game Newcastle could have had \"three, four or five\" goals, but it was his header that proved to be the winner from another teasing Ritchie delivery.\nThe 28-year-old former Bournemouth man made three key passes as he and Ghana winger Atsu drifted between the lines to cause Stoke problems, especially in the first half.\nJoselu, facing his former club for the first time since joining Newcastle in August, was one of those guilty of not putting more gloss on the scoreline, with only one of his five shots finding the target.\nShaqiri - the fox outside the box\nStoke winger Shaqiri does not score simple goals.\nIt was a fantastic finish to pull his side level from the Switzerland international, whose past six Premier League goals have all come from outside the box.\nShaqiri's brilliance was a rare clinical moment for the visitors, who saw Mame Biram Diouf head wide when unmarked in stoppage time having earlier sliced off target from inside the area.\nStoke have taken points off Arsenal and Manchester United in recent weeks, but Mark Hughes called for his side to be more \"vigilant\" after they were too easily prised open by Newcastle at St James' Park.\nHughes opted for a back three, in which Kurt Zouma shone, as the Chelsea loanee won 100% of his aerial duels and proved a starting point for Stoke to attack.\nBut it was fellow defenders Bruno Martins Indi and Kevin Wimmer who struggled with Joselu's relentless running before the ex-Potters striker was replaced late on.\nMan of the match - Matt Ritchie (Newcastle)\n'The fans are thinking about Europe'\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez, who was back in the dugout after missing the win at Swansea last week following surgery: \"Normally I am a little bit more agitated, but today I have to be careful, it will take some time to heal, but at least winning is always easier.\n\"This group of players works very hard. Sometimes we have some problems, but with the chances we can create we know they can give us the points.\n\"The fans, when you win so many games in a row, they are excited and thinking about Europe - for me it is one game at a time.\n\"It is a very competitive league and we are learning from that.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We have played better than that in recent weeks and it's disappointing from our point of view. We were loose in our general play and the accuracy of our passing.\n\"We had to be vigilant, but towards the end of the game we made a mistake on the set-play after working really hard to get back on level terms.\n\"We went for it at the end, but it wasn't to be.\n\"Second half we controlled the game for the vast majority, they were just looking to break on us. We didn't quite do our jobs at a corner and Jack [Butland] wasn't able to save it. We'll move on to the next one.\n\"We are a good side and we can knock it around, but at key moments we have to be clinical.\"\nThe stats - Stoke's struggles on the road continue\nNewcastle have won three consecutive top-flight games for the first time since November 2014.\nStoke have enjoyed just one win in their past 11 away league games, drawing three and losing seven.\nChristian Atsu scored his first-ever Premier League goal in his 10th appearance in the competition (despite making his English top-flight debut in August 2014).\nMatt Ritchie has provided 11 assists in the league since the start of last season, more than any other Newcastle player.\nRitchie has registered four assists in his past three Premier League games.\nOnly two of Xherdan Shaqiri's eight goals in the competition have come from inside the area.\nThe Swiss winger has been directly involved in two goals in his past two top-flight games (one goal, one assist), after none in his previous eight.\nAll four of Jamaal Lascelles' Premier League goals have been headers from corners.\nWhat's next?\nStoke travel to Bristol City in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, before hosting Chelsea in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 BST).

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 1-1 Leicester City\nJamie Vardy's second-half penalty earned Leicester City a point against a dominant Huddersfield Town at John Smith's Stadium.\nAndy King won the spot-kick for the Foxes after he was tripped from behind by Chris Lowe inside the box. The subsequent goal was the first that Jonas Lossl has conceded at home in the Premier League this season.\nThe Terriers led through Laurent Depoitre, who scored the opener inside the first minute of the second half on his full debut in the top flight.\nThe hosts found the back of the net again just after Vardy's equaliser, when Elias Kachunga got the final touch on Mathias Jorgensen's effort, but it was ruled offside and the goal was disallowed.\nLeicester had another penalty shout in the closing stages when Jorgensen made contact with Demarai Gray from behind, but referee Jon Moss didn't give it.\nDavid Wagner's side remain unbeaten at home in the Premier League and have risen to fifth in the table.\nRelive Huddersfield v Leicester here.\nFollow the reaction to Saturday's games\nA point that favours the Foxes\nWagner was left frustrated by the decision to rule out Kachunga's goal and felt Huddersfield were unlucky not to take three points.\nHaving watched the goal back, Wagner said Kachunga was \"clearly onside\". He added: \"This was obvious and should not happen and was not difficult to see.\n\"I am disappointed because I think we deserved the second goal. We have to accept that we only have one point but we were able to get more.\"\nThe point favours a Leicester City side who have had a tricky start to the season with four points from five games.\nOther than their penalty, Leicester didn't have a single shot on target and produced only five shots throughout the match, compared with Huddersfield's 15.\nWith 15 goals in his past 18 games, Jamie Vardy has found some of his form from Leicester's title-winning campaign. Shakespeare is constantly stressing the importance of Vardy's role in the team, but he was restricted to just three touches in Huddersfield's box on Saturday.\nIt would have been four, and ultimately the winning goal when he missed a golden opportunity with 10 minutes to go. Riyad Mahrez whipped in a perfect cross towards Vardy at the far post. All he needed was a touch but it just wasn't his day.\nShakespeare's side have now won just one of their past eight Premier League games.\nTerriers can be competitive\nAlthough the fixture list has been kind to Huddersfield with games against Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Southampton, West Ham and Leicester, Wagner's side have shown they can be competitive in the Premier League.\nTheir attacking style of play has been refreshing to watch, and with an average possession of 59.8% against Leicester, Huddersfield are not a team to park the bus and sit back.\nWith Tottenham, Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea to come before Christmas, the Terriers will want as many points as possible.\nTheir home form is going to be key, and although they remain unbeaten at John Smith's Stadium this season, they have won only one of their past five home league games.\nThe fans were again like the twelfth man and the atmosphere was brilliant throughout. That will be vital, especially in the trickier fixtures.\nMan of the match - Aaron Mooy\n'It has to be a good point' - manager reaction\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner:\n\"Performance wise we played well. High intensity and very energetic. The performance was very good from my point of view. The whole team has shown a great attitude and great spirit. They showed the reaction we expected and we bounced back. I am disappointed because I think we deserved the second goal.\n\"We were a little bit disorganised in the minutes after we scored and then we were a little bit unlucky and conceded the penalty, but we shouldn't forget it's Leicester who are a top quality side. We accept the point even if it doesn't feel good because we scored the second goal which unfortunately didn't count.\n\"We've shown today again that we are capable and competitive and are able to stick to our way of football. We had one very poor performance and four performances where we were good and collected points. This is fair so far even when I think we were able to get three points today.\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare:\n\"I think it has to be a good point. I said to the players if they offered us a point at half-time we'd have taken it. To go a goal down straight after half-time was disappointing and we had to show a lot of character. Scoring soon after was important, but in the first half we were second best.\n\"We had quite a few players off the pace today but ultimately we have to be pleased with a point.\"\nDebut goals and penalty records - the stats\nHuddersfield have won just one of their past five home league games (D2 L2), after winning nine of the 12 before that.\nLeicester have registered just one clean sheet in their past eight PL games, shipping 18 goals in that period.\nLaurent Depoitre scored on his first Premier League start for Huddersfield, with only his second shot on target overall for the Terriers in the competition.\nJamie Vardy has had a hand in 15 goals [12 goals, three assists] in 18 Premier League appearances under Craig Shakespeare.\nSince their return to the top flight in 2014-15, the Foxes have won 25 penalties, scoring 19 of them, only Manchester City [26 taken, 20 scored] can better them on both counts.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield travel to Crystal Palace on Tuesday in the EFL Cup, before returning to the Premier League on Saturday with a trip to Turf Moor (15:00 BST).\nLeicester host Liverpool twice in the space of five days. Jurgen Klopp's side will make the trip to King Power Stadium on Tuesday in the EFL Cup, and again on Saturday in the Premier League late kick-off (17:30 BST)."

We are so happy'\nTalks of a hangover from a midweek 4-0 win at Feyenoord in the Champions League were quickly put to bed when Manchester City got started at Vicarage Road.\nGuardiola's side controlled possession throughout, and returned from the half-time break wanting more even after taking a 3-0 first-half lead.\n\"It was so good. Especially after an away game in the Champions League. The way we played as a team, we are so happy,\" said the City boss.\n\"I was lucky to manage Barcelona with many outstanding performances but this week has been a lot of goals. We have found our game, we can make short passes and we have a lot of energy from our full-backs.\"\nCity had 28 shots in total with 10 on target - five in each half - while individually, David Silva had 88 touches, completing 93% of his passes with two assists, and De Bruyne also impressed making four key passes and setting up the opener.\nBut Aguero was the one man who impressed the most.\nAguero closes in on all-time City record\nAguero was in uncompromising form in front of goal once again, and he has now scored nine goals in five games against the Hornets.\nGuardiola particularly enjoyed the 29-year-old's third goal, where he received the ball from Kyle Walker, ran past several yellow shirts and maintained his composure to sneak the ball home from an acute angle.\n\"His numbers speak for themselves,\" said Guardiola. \"I'm so happy for the third goal because he's so clever in the box. He's able to score a goal at any point.\"\nAguero's hat-trick - his sixth in the Premier League and 10th for City - has moved the Argentine only two away from Manchester City's all-time scoring record of 177, set by Eric Brook between 1928 and 1940.\nSilva brought down to earth with a bang\nMarco Silva had made a good start to life as Watford manager, with two wins and two draws from their opening four league matches.\nBut City provided the Hornets with their first real test from a title contender and they buckled under the pressure.\nDespite being under the cosh for the first half an hour, Watford were able to break forward on the counter-attack and Richarlison had the best chance to head home before City went on the rampage.\nSilva felt aggrieved that the offside flag was not raised for Aguero's opener and Jesus's goal in the first half, although the decisions were not wildly contested by the players on the field.\nThey also had a penalty shout when Walker clumsily clattered into Nathaniel Chalobah.\nThe Hornets did not play badly, but City were just too good.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero\nMan City love a trip to Vicarage Road\nMan City (11) have scored more goals in their last two Premier League games at Vicarage Road than Watford (10) have in their last nine at the ground.\nGabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 15 goals in his 15 Premier League appearances (11 goals, 4 assists).\nSergio Aguero scored his sixth Premier League hat-trick; only Alan Shearer (11), Robbie Fowler (9), Michael Owen and Thierry Henry (8) have scored more.\nAguero has been involved in 11 goals in five appearances against Watford in all competitions (nine goals, two assists).\nDavid Silva provided two assists in a Premier League game for the first time since March 2016 versus Aston Villa.\nPost-match reaction\nWatford boss Marco Silva: \"The first and third goals are offside, it is not a normal game. We had a clear penalty for Chalobah. Everything is difficult for us this afternoon.\n\"City deserved the three points, we learn as a team. We can't make mistakes. But it's really difficult with these decisions.\"\nManchester City forward Raheem Sterling: \"Everyone's buzzing, it was a great performance. We were really clinical and that's what the manager wants from us.\n\"We have shown signs of great football but we need to be clinical and in the last few games that's what has happened. I'm always pleased to score.\n\"Give Sergio Aguero a chance and nine times out of 10 he'll score.\"\nWho's up next\nWatford travel to Swansea on Saturday in the Premier League (15:00 BST) while Manchester City face West Brom in the EFL Cup on Wednesday (20:00 BST)"

        "article_text": "Liverpool 1-1 Burnley\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said he was \"angry with the result but pleased with the performance\" after Burnley frustrated his side on Philippe Coutinho's return to the starting line-up.\nThe Reds racked up 35 efforts at goal to the Clarets' five, but could have lost had Joel Matip not cleared Ben Mee's header off the line late on.\n\"It's our fault. We were dominant, fantastic attitude. We played good, were fluent with seven changes, but only one goal,\" added Klopp.\n\"It's the best we have played against Burnley since I have been in. In the past we didn't feel good in the game. Today I saw fluid movements, passing between the lines, speed, crosses.\n\"We have to take the point and carry on.\"\nBurnley went ahead through Scott Arfield's crisp finish on a rare foray forward in the 27th minute.\nMohamed Salah swivelled to dispatch a shot past goalkeeper Nick Pope three minutes later, but the seemingly inevitable second never arrived for the hosts.\nSubstitute Dominic Solanke's instinctive side-foot volley against the bar was as close as the Reds came, as Burnley enjoyed another fruitful away day after an opening-day victory at Chelsea and a draw against Tottenham.\nListen: 'Biggest clown of the lot is Klopp' - Liverpool fan's rant on 606\nMissing Mane?\nThe suspension of Sadio Mane in the wake of his red card at Manchester City ushered in the return of Philippe Coutinho to Jurgen Klopp's starting line-up and the Brazilian seemed eager to show his commitment to the cause after an unsettled summer, featuring several offers from Barcelona.\nAfforded a deeper role behind the attacking trio of Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge and Salah, he was as industrious as he was inventive.\nOnly centre-back Ragnar Klaven recorded more touches than Coutinho despite the attacker being brought off with 11 minutes to go.\nLike his team though, his finishing was not good enough to convert pressure into a lead. Too often, Liverpool's shots were too wayward and from too far out.\nOn an afternoon of deep frustration, Klopp may take solace from the performance of Salah, whose speed and direct running provided a contrasting threat to Coutinho's clever angles and probing passes.\nThe Egyptian's return of five goals in eight games since signing from Roma in the summer could be even more impressive however - too often he found goalkeeper Pope rather than the back of the net when well placed. The suspicion is that Mane would not be found similarly wanting.\nBurnley's happy travels continue\nBurnley won only seven of their 40 points last season away from Turf Moor.\nBut they are only two away from matching that total after trips to Stamford Bridge, Wembley and Anfield in their opening three away fixtures of this campaign.\nOccasionally the visitors rode their luck.\nMee could have seen a penalty awarded against him for a foul on Salah and 25-year-old Pope - excellent on his first Premier League start in place of the injured Tom Heaton - was helpless as Solanke hit the woodwork.\nBut the Clarets' trademark organisation and concentration - embodying boss Sean Dyche's priorities- restricted Liverpool to efforts from distance for long periods.\nThey are seventh, above today's opponents on goal difference, and can look forward to a more comfortable fight against relegation, at the very least, if they continue to prosper on the road.\nBurnley exploit familiar failing\nBurnley boss Dyche admitted after the match that he encouraged his team to play direct and test Liverpool's defence after seeing their discomfort in the air at times this season.\nA new centre-back combination of Klavan and Matip did little to solidify the Reds rearguard and Chris Wood's presence was enough to distract both in the lead-up to the opener.\nMee came close with headers from successive corners in the final 10 minutes and the frustration from the stands in reaction was surely aimed, not just at today's performance, but at the club's failure to strengthen in that area over the summer.\nIt is a failing that continues to undermine Liverpool's free-flowing attacking unit.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\n'It's not about their defending' - reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"When you have shots on goal it's not about their defending. Their keeper made a few outstanding saves.\nPhilippe had a really good game. He had a little cramp at the end. We did not plan to take him off but we had to decide differently.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"I'm not afraid to get the ball forward and I thought that was effective. Our shape was good and Popey was excellent in goal.\n\"We know it's tough coming to these places and we are willing to do the bits that are nitty gritty in the game. Very few teams will come here and dominate, we knew we would have to do the basics. Now and again you need a bit of luck.\n\"We are still learning a little bit, me included but I'm very pleased with today.\"\nLots of shots, short on points - match stats\nLiverpool had 35 attempts on goal - since 2003-04, they've only had more in a single Premier League match once (37 in the 4-0 win over Everton in April 2016).\nBurnley have scored in consecutive league games at Anfield for the first time since August 1969.\nThese were the first points Burnley earned in a league match at Anfield since a 1-0 win in September 1974 - they had lost their previous four in a row before today.\nEmre Can has provided as many assists in his four Premier League games this season as he had in his previous 89 combined in the competition (2).\nLiverpool have averaged 72% possession over their last three Premier League games against Burnley, but have only managed to win one of those games (D1 L1).\nMohamed Salah is now Liverpool's top scorer in all competitions this season with five goals.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Leicester in the League Cup on Tuesday before making the same trip in the Premier League on Saturday, 23 September.\nBurnley take on Championship high-flyers Leeds in the League Cup on Tuesday before welcoming Huddersfield to Turf Moor the following Saturday in the league."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 0-0 West Ham United\nGareth Barry can play for \"another two or three years\" after making a record-equalling 632nd Premier League appearance, says West Brom manager Tony Pulis.\nBarry, who shares the record with Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs, reached the milestone in Saturday's 0-0 draw against West Ham at The Hawthorns.\nThe 36-year-old also became the first player to start 600 Premier League games.\nPulis said Barry can continue to play at the highest level because of \"the way he looks after himself\".\n\"I am disappointed he is not just starting with us and is coming to the back end of his career,\" Pulis told BBC Sport.\n\"He was a player I admired and respected. When we brought him into the club we realised how good he was.\"\nSaturday's match was short on chances, with just two shots on target in the 90 minutes.\nWest Ham's Pedro Obiang provided the only real moment of quality, catching Ben Foster off his line and hitting the crossbar from just outside the centre circle.\nAfter the break, Foster was perhaps lucky to escape with just a booking as he raced out of his box and lunged at the onrushing Javier Hernandez.\nThe result moves West Brom into the top half of the table, while the Hammers remain in the bottom three on goal difference.\nRelive the goalless draw between West Ham and West Brom\n'A proud moment'\nBarry was just 17 when he made his Premier League debut for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday on 2 May 1998. Boyzone's All That I Need topped the charts at the time, while Tony Blair was prime minister.\nBarry played for Everton and Manchester City between his spells at Villa and West Brom, and Saturday's record-equalling appearance came 19 years and 137 days since his debut.\n\"It's a proud moment for me,\" said the 36-year-old, who moved to The Hawthorns on a one-year deal in August.\nBarry, who sent a first-half header wide, told BBC Sport: \"It is a huge number. It is lucky I have managed to keep fit throughout the years. It is not until I look back when I hang my boots up that I will realise what a big number it is.\n\"I still remember [his debut] so well, so much has happened since, it has gone quick.\n\"I will stop when I stop enjoying it and I will know when I have had enough and can't keep up with the boys.\"\nHernandez's struggles\nBoth teams were lacking in front of goal, with only a tame Michail Antonio shot and a Hal Robson-Kanu header forcing a save from either keeper.\nJavier Hernandez was almost anonymous until he was involved in the incident with Foster in the 66th minute. He was substituted for the second game in a row.\nThe former Manchester United striker, who has scored two goals this season, touched the ball just once in the Baggies box and did not seem to gel with Andy Carroll, who was the focal point of the Hammers' attack.\nAnother worry for the Londoners will be the fitness of defender James Collins, who limped off in the 58th minute.\n\"He has damaged the ankle ligaments. We will assess him and see how long he will be out,\" said manager Slaven Bilic.\nMan of the match - Jonny Evans\nWhat they said - 'Take a point and move on'\nBaggies boss Tony Pulis: \"We only had a couple of clear-cut chances, just two opportunities in the match against a good West Ham side.\n\"But we got a clean sheet and the players gave it everything, we just need a bit more quality in the final third. We take a point and move on.\"\nHammers manager Slaven Bilic: \"We played solidly and limited them to one chance. In the second half we played more dominant football.\n\"Two clean sheets in two games is important progress. I am not extremely delighted but there are a lot of positives to build on.\"\nStats - Baggies love a 0-0 draw\nWest Ham kept just their second clean sheet in their past 19 away matches in the Premier League.\nOnly Southampton (13) and Man Utd (12) have recorded more 0-0 draws in the Premier League than West Brom (10) since Tony Pulis took over in January 2015.\nWest Brom have won just two of their past 14 matches versus West Ham in the Premier League (D9 L3).\nWest Ham have won just once in their past 11 Premier League away games (W1 D4 L6).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in EFL Cup action this week. West Brom host Manchester City on Wednesday, while Championship side Bolton travel to West Ham on Tuesday.\nThe Hammers then host Tottenham in the league on Saturday, while the Baggies are at Arsenal on Monday 25 September."

And the South Korean had little to do defensively.\nAurier's introduction on 63 minutes at left-back allowed Son to push further up in attack, while Llorente came on against his former club to offer a different attacking option.\nTottenham have gone three league home games in a row without a win for the first time since December 2013. But they have at least kept a first clean sheet at Wembley since the 2009 League Cup final against Manchester United, having conceded in their previous 11 matches.\nMan of the match - Lukasz Fabianski\nWhat they said - 'We did everything to win'\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: \"I am very proud of the players and the effort they put in to get the result. I said to be confident in your defending and if you do that, and are nice and compact, you can get a result here.\n\"I am confident in this group that if they execute what they did in training, they can do well.\"\n\"We played a very good side that came off the back of a very good result in the Champions League.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"It is very disappointing because we did everything to win. We created chances and dominated the game but were a little unlucky.\n\"I am happy with the performance although it is another game we drew here at Wembley and that is no good.\n\"I like to talk about my team, we created a lot of chances to score. It is true after the draw to say well done to Swansea and congratulate them for taking a draw.\"\nStats - Shot-shy Swans\nSwansea failed to register a single shot on target for the third time in their five Premier League matches this season.\nThe Swans have been responsible for three of the seven occasions a Premier League side has failed to hit a single shot on target in a Premier League game this season.\nFabianski kept his first clean sheet against Tottenham since Arsenal's 2-0 win against them in the FA Cup third round in 2013-14, having conceded 15 goals in his previous five games against them for Swansea.\nTottenham recorded 75% possession - their highest in a single Premier League match since Opta began recording this data in 2003-04.\nThis was also Swansea's lowest ever possession figure in the Premier League since they were promoted in 2011 (25%).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Barnsley in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, before a trip to West Ham in the league on Saturday.\nSwansea are in League Cup action against Reading on Tuesday, before Saturday's visit of Watford in the league."

We could have won but overall it was an intense, disciplined and battling game.\n\"We are not in a transfer period and on the day we played Liverpool that affected us. We are all human beings. If you play 55 games a season you can have a bad performance.\n\"We had a bad record recently here and they are strong at home. But we showed solidarity and that was very good. We didn't hide when we had the ball and this is a good basis to build on for future games.\"\nThe draw was a fully deserved reward for an excellent display that could even have brought victory against the Premier League champions, who finished with 10 men following the late dismissal of David Luiz for a high tackle on Sead Kolasinac.\n\"I don't like to comment about the referee,\" said Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. \"We have great respect for officials, but it is strange to finish a third game in a row against Arsenal with 10 men.\"\nThe point leaves Chelsea third in the table, three points behind Manchester City and Manchester United.\n\"It was a good, open game with both teams trying to win,\" added Conte. \"Every game against Arsenal is always very tough. We knew very well what type of game we would face. Both teams are great teams - it's a good draw.\"\nPedro missed Chelsea's best chance in the first half when he raced clear but was blocked by Arsenal keeper Petr Cech.\nArsenal, however, had arguably the better opportunities as Danny Welbeck headed wide from in front of goal and Aaron Ramsey struck a post, Alexandre Lacazette firing the rebound over an open goal.\nThe second period was a tighter affair, the Blues' frustrations boiling over in the closing minutes when Luiz was shown red for his reckless challenge on Kolasinac.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge\nFootball Daily podcast: Reaction to Sunday's two Premier League matches\nExcellent Arsenal show real steel\nWenger insisted the debacle of the loss at Liverpool in August - a performance that provoked fierce criticism of both manager and players - was an \"accident\".\nThe words were greeted with cynicism by those who had been at the scene of identical Arsenal 'accidents' at Anfield three times in the past four years and wondered whether Wenger was again at odds with the reality of the Gunners' plight.\nArsenal's display on Sunday, full of steel and discipline as well as attacking intent, gave the Frenchman's theory plenty of weight as they stood toe-to-toe with the champions and were the better side for spells.\nThe trick now is for Arsenal to provide further evidence that this excellent performance - at a ground which has been a stage of unrelenting misery is recent years - is the rule and the display at Anfield is the exception.\nWenger's team selection was an improvement on the fiasco of Anfield, where Lacazette and Kolasinac were inexplicably left out when threat and physical presence were essential.\nArsenal's manager cut an agitated figure in his technical area for much of the game, spending time in dialogue with the officials nearby, but there was much for Wenger to be satisfied with as they more than matched Chelsea.\nLuiz continues Mane debate\nLuiz was shown a straight red card for his challenge on Kolasinac near the touchline with only three minutes left.\nAnd yet the Brazil international may have feared dismissal earlier in the half when his flying overhead kick caught Laurent Koscielny near the face in the penalty area - before referee Michael Oliver issued a yellow card.\nThe incident revived the debate sparked by Sadio Mane's dismissal for Liverpool at Manchester City last Saturday, when his high boot injured keeper Ederson.\nSocial media was instantly alive, especially with Reds fans highlighting what they regarded as an injustice.\nJon Moss was the referee at Etihad Stadium and was clearly implementing the law that says: \"Serious foul play - a tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses excessive force\u2026\"\nOliver clearly deemed this not to be the case with Luiz's challenge on Koscielny - but it will not stop the debate.\nChelsea left frustrated\nThe Blues have recovered impressively with four straight wins after the opening-day home defeat by Burnley - but Stamford Bridge was seething with frustration at the final whistle here.\nArsenal were clearly the happier side, although they will feel irritated they could not get three points as Chelsea were kept out with a performance containing a resilience the Gunners are often accused of lacking.\nPedro wasted Chelsea's best chance, while Alvaro Morata showed plenty of good touches but also a willingness to go to ground too easily under physical challenges.\nThe hosts' mood was summed up by Conte's animated fury in the closing moments, especially after Luiz's red card.\nIt was not the best of the days for the champions.\nMan of the match - Shkodran Mustafi\nConte sees a goal drought for the first time\nChelsea failed to score in a competitive home match under Conte for the first time (27 games).\nThe last time that they failed to net in a competitive game at Stamford Bridge was in April 2016 against Manchester City when Guus Hiddink was in charge - 29 games ago.\nThis was the first 0-0 draw between these two sides at Stamford Bridge since April 2005 and the first time that Chelsea have failed to score at home against the Gunners since then.\nArsenal have now failed to score in eight of their past 14 trips to Chelsea.\nChelsea have been given as many red cards in their past five Premier League games (three) as they had in their previous 73.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea face Championship side Nottingham Forest in the EFL Cup on Wednesday (19:45 BST kick-off), before returning to Premier League action against Stoke on Saturday (15:00).\nArsenal are also in EFL Cup action on Wednesday as they welcome Doncaster Rovers of League One to Emirates Stadium (19:45), before hosting West Brom on Monday, 25 September in the league (20:00)."

If the two teams had identical records at the end of the season, there would be a play-off.\nAnalysis: Why toothless Everton carry such little threat\nMan Utd 4-0 Everton - as it happened\nFootball Daily podcast: Rooney return ends in heavy defeat\nLukaku adds late sheen\nLukaku, who left Everton to join United for \u00a375m in July, was kept quiet for most of the game but set up Mkhitaryan with a smart pass to punish a costly Ashley Williams mistake, and then celebrated in front of the away fans when he scored the third a minute from time.\nThe Belgium international has scored five goals in his five league appearances for his new club but did miss a great chance in the first half.\nClean through on goal after another defensive error, he fired wastefully wide in front of the Stretford End.\nBut he took his chance clinically in the last minute. His initial free-kick hit the wall, but when the ball was played back in, he latched on to Jesse Lingard's flick to fire in, before cupping his ears to the Everton fans.\nLonely return for Rooney\nRooney scored 253 goals for United in his 13 years at the club, but after an expected and justified warm welcome on his return, he cut a frustrated and lonely figure at times.\nHis move back to boyhood club Everton in July was widely heralded, and his two goals this season remain the club's only strikes in the Premier League.\nEngland and Manchester United may have decided in recent years that his best position is not up front but he started there and was isolated for long periods before moving deeper in the second half.\nHe had Everton's two best chances, steering a shot wide in the first half and then shooting straight at David de Gea seconds after the interval.\nRooney was given a standing ovation and handshake from Mourinho when replaced inside the last 10 minutes - after which Everton collapsed. It is now 325 minutes since they scored in the league.\nEverton in trouble?\nKoeman spent lavishly this summer on Rooney, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford and Davy Klaassen to build - on paper at least - a strong Premier League squad.\nBut in failing to replace Lukaku, he left the side short of pace and mobility up front - as well as goals.\nThe Toffees turned in a dismal performance against Tottenham last weekend and were even worse against Atalanta in their Europa League opener on Thursday night.\nSunday's trip to Old Trafford always looked an ominous way to end a tough week and from the moment Valencia cracked in his sensational opener, the writing was on the wall for a manager who had admitted before the match that he was \"worried\".\nAfter the game, he admitted that his side looked \"afraid\" and lacked confidence.\nThe men in blue were perhaps blameless for Valencia's superb strike but they were so deep in the opening exchanges that Sigurdsson was practically playing at left-back.\nEverton have faced four of last season's top six in their opening five games, but have only mustered 10 shots on target all season.\nThey improved markedly in the second half - before United's late flurry of goals - but are yet to get the best out of their new signings. and find themselves in the relegation zone for the first time since the opening day of the 2011-12 season.\nKoeman now has four games in a row at home.

Everton start that run of home games against Sunderland in the cup on Wednesday, with Bournemouth the visitors on Saturday."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur\nIn-form striker Harry Kane scored twice as 10-man Tottenham survived a late fightback from West Ham to move up to third in the Premier League.\nKane's header and low strike gave the visitors a 2-0 half-time lead before midfielder Christian Eriksen fired home the third in the 60th minute.\nThe Hammers had been disjointed and jaded to that point, but five minutes later Mexico forward Javier Hernandez nodded in from close range.\nTottenham wing-back Serge Aurier was then shown a second yellow card 20 minutes from time for a late tackle on Andy Carroll.\nWest Ham made their numerical advantage count when Cheikhou Kouyate powered in a magnificent cross from substitute Arthur Masuaku with three minutes left.\nHowever, the Hammers - who are 17th - failed to test the Spurs goal again as they lost for the fourth time in the league this season.\n\"Sometimes it is good to suffer a bit as it means you are alive,\" said Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino after the game.\n\"We suffered but we fought. We played well and deserved to win the game.\n\"It means more than three points. We played for our pride and the emotion of our fans and I'm happy for my players.\"\nRelive the action from London Stadium\nTottenham trio do damage again\nSpurs boss Pochettino treated his players to a steak dinner this week in what was billed as a team-bonding exercise before this match.\nThe Argentine said: \"You need time to create a good dynamic, not only tactics but outside too.\"\nThat spirit of togetherness has been fostered since Pochettino's arrival in 2014, and three of his key players with a close bond off the pitch once again displayed their connection on it.\nSpurs' attacking triumvirate of Eriksen, Kane and Dele Alli is arguably the most potent in England. Last season, both Eriksen and Alli provided nine assists for Kane - the Premier League's joint-highest assist rate for a team-mate - and Eriksen provided seven for Alli.\nThe trio were at it again at London Stadium.\nThey combined for the opener when Carroll inadvertently played the ball to Eriksen in the middle. The Dane found Alli, who in turn found the head of his England team-mate. Kane, under no pressure, nodded in for his fifth goal in his past four appearances.\nThat became six in four a few moments later. After Carroll failed to win an aerial contest with Jan Vertonghen, Eriksen's brilliant flick released Kane, who played in Alli. The midfielder's shot was blocked by Joe Hart, but his predatory colleague followed up.\nAfter the break, Eriksen joined them on the scoresheet with a low, 12-yard strike after Kane's curling free-kick came off the foot of the post.\nPochettino was again full of praise for England striker Kane, who has now scored seven goals in his past six Premier League games against West Ham.\n\"I find it hard to find the words to describe him,\" said Pochettino. \"I am in love like the fans are in love, like his team-mates are in love.\n\"He is so humble, he keeps all the values that managers like me appreciate a lot. That is why I am in love with him for different reasons.\"\nHammers fall short of great fightback\nHome fans chanted \"sacked in the morning\" at manager Slaven Bilic when his side trailed 3-0, and while his approval rating may have improved after a rousing comeback, his team remain near the foot of the table.\nThe Hammers went into the match having won three of the past four home league meetings with Spurs, but losing winger Michail Antonio to injury coupled with Kane's two first-half strikes left a fourth in five looking unlikely.\nEven after Hernandez headed in, it appeared little more than a consolation until Aurier was deservedly sent off for his ill-judged tackle on Carroll.\nThe odds on West Ham completing a great comeback shortened when Kouyate headed in, however a late melee in the closing seconds sucked the impetus out of West Ham.\nAfter good recent performances, this was another step back for Bilic and his team.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\n'The game was very hectic' - reaction\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic, talking to BBC Sport: \"We are disappointed with the result. We started really well. We defended well, with shape and didn't give them pockets of space. Before the first goal we had lots of attacking opportunities but we didn't use it. Then we make a mistake and their finish was clinical. The first half was nowhere near 2-0.\n\"We came back and after the red card we pressed them. In the end we came to 3-2 but there wasn't enough. The game was very hectic with fouls and time-wasting. We showed good pride to come back.\n\"When you play against the top teams, you give a little and from that little they create a chance and score.\n\"It was very even at 0-0. It is very hard to come back after 2-0.\"\nTottenham striker Harry Kane: \"When you are 3-0 up and end up going 3-1 or 3-2 it is always nerve-wracking, especially with 10 men. But it is a great result.\n\"I just want to score against every team. I am delighted to get a couple and help the team win.\n\"We know we have to improve our home form and we will be right up there. To get nine points from three away games is really good.\"\nEriksen is the greatest Dane - the stats\nSpurs have won their opening three away games in a league season for the first time since 1991-92.\nKane now has the best minutes-per-goal record in Premier League London derbies of any player to score 10+ goals (112.6 - 21 goals in 29 games).\nSince the start of 2015-16, Alli has provided 11 assists for Kane in the Premier League, more than any other player for a team-mate.\nEriksen is now the top-scoring Dane in the Premier League (33).\nAll 40 of Hernandez's Premier League goals have been from inside the box. Tim Cahill (56/56) and John Terry (41/41) are the only players to have scored more with 100% records.\nJose Fonte registered his first Premier League goal involvement in his past 39 games in the competition (since an assist v Man City in May 2016).\nAurier is the first Spurs player to be sent off in the Premier League since Vlad Chiriches against Stoke in May 2015, 868 days ago.\nWhat's next?\nSpurs travel to Cyprus for Tuesday's Champions League match against Apoel Nicosia, and are then away at Huddersfield for next Saturday's early Premier League match (12:30 BST).\nThe Hammers are at home to Swansea next Saturday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-1 Manchester United\nRomelu Lukaku scored his sixth Premier League goal of the season to give Manchester United a hard-fought victory at Southampton.\nLukaku broke the deadlock on 20 minutes, converting the rebound after Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster parried his header from Ashley Young's cross.\nThe result maintains United's unbeaten start to their league campaign, although they are second in the table, behind Manchester City on goal difference.\nTheir latest victory was not routine as Southampton piled on the pressure in the second half, and United's Marouane Fellaini had to clear Oriol Romeu's header off the line.\nIn a bizarre end to the match, referee Craig Pawson sent United boss Jose Mourinho to the stand.\nAsked why he had been dismissed, Mourinho said: \"I don't know. You have to ask the referee.\"\nThe Portuguese added he did not think he had gone on the pitch.\nMan Utd ask for CCTV over Lukaku chant\nRelive Southampton versus Manchester United as it happened\nAnalysis and reaction from today's Premier League games\nSaints give United a scare\nAfter dominating the first half, it looked like being another routine afternoon for United.\nBut they had to defend deep after the break, with Southampton having the majority of the chances and possession.\nUnited, who have only conceded two goals in six league games so far this season, ended the game with six defenders on the pitch as Mourinho brought on Chris Smalling and Daley Blind to hold on to the points.\nSouthampton had chances - Romeu's header beat David de Gea but Fellaini was well placed to clear it off the line, before the excellent Romeu shot narrowly wide from a tight angle.\nNathan Redmond also had a shot saved by De Gea, and not even the second-half introduction of forwards Manolo Gabbiadini and Charlie Austin could unsettle United's defence.\nSouthampton have scored only four league goals this season, but manager Mauricio Pellegrino can take huge encouragement from their second-half performance.\nUnited do enough in first half\nSouthampton's dominance after the break was surprising, particularly given how the first half had progressed.\nUnited attacked with a free-flowing nature that was pleasing on the eye. Their main successes came down the left, with Marcus Rashford's pace, technique and dribbling ability, along with his link-up play with Henrikh Mkhitaryan, causing the home defence problems.\nAnd they got their reward when Lukaku scored in the sixth successive game for club and country, finishing from close range after Forster had parried his powerful header from Young's fine cross from the left.\nRashford then narrowly fired wide from a 25-yard free-kick but the visitors were forced back after the break and had to rely on counter-attacks.\nThey still had a couple of chances, Lukaku having an effort saved by Forster, and substitute Ander Herrera shooting over when well placed.\nAnd they held on for a fifth win in six Premier League matches, with 17 goals scored and only two conceded.\nMan of the match - Oriol Romeu (Southampton)\nUnited's best start for six years - the stats\nSixteen points from their opening six games is United's best start to a Premier League season since 2011-12.\nSaints have failed to score in eight of their past nine home Premier League games, with their 3-2 win against West Ham this season the exception.\nLukaku has scored six goals in his six Premier League games this season - Louis Saha is the only other player to have scored as many goals in his first six games for United in the competition.\nSouthampton have lost 11 Premier League games in 2017 - as many as they had lost in 2016, with 15 matches still to play this year.\nMourinho's side have kept the most clean sheets (five) and conceded the joint-fewest goals (two) among the 20 Premier League sides this season.\nThis was only the second time Southampton have outshot their opponents in a Premier League game this season (14-9), but they have failed to score both times (also vs Swansea).\n'I was not expecting him match after match to score' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino said: \"You have to score goals. We did well, we played a good game and it is difficult to control this team, but we have to learn and be more aggressive. We gave everything but one action changed the game.\n\"It is the most difficult thing in modern football to score.\n\"I think we controlled the game but we allowed them to play in counter-attack and that is something they are really good. They were under pressure all the time.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho said: \"It is not always possible for high quality, but we fought hard. We did for 25 minutes what many teams do for 90 minutes - to have five at the back and defend.\n\"We had two chances to kill the game, which is what we felt we could do, but credit to them, they tried to play, they sent on a second striker to play more direct but we fought really hard and I am happy.\n\"The majority of our players did not play in the midweek match [against Burton in the Carabao Cup]. Maybe it was the heat because we don't see the sun in Manchester often. I felt the boys were not sharp, so the option was to go for the points.\n\"The way we attack is something we are doing since the start of the season, to defend like that was the first time that had happened to us this season.\nOn striker Romelu Lukaku, who scored his eighth goal for United in all competitions, Mourinho added: \"I knew he would score goals, more for us than he did for Everton or West Brom, that is logical, but I was not expecting him match after match to put the ball in the net.\n\"He is a striker that is scoring goals, but his work is so important for us and he worked hard like everybody else.\"\nWhat's next?\nIt is another busy week for United as they travel to Russia to play CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday (19:45 BST), before returning to Premier League action on Saturday when they host bottom-of-the-table Crystal Palace (15:00 BST).\nSouthampton's next game is at Stoke City on Saturday, 30 September (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-0 Huddersfield Town\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche says new rules on retrospective bans for diving do not go far enough, despite Huddersfield's Rajiv van la Parra being booked for simulation in Saturday's 0-0 draw at Turf Moor.\nThe Dutchman, who went down under pressure from Matt Lowton despite no apparent contact, appealed for a penalty in the 73rd minute, but referee Chris Kavanagh instead showed the Terriers substitute a yellow card.\nUnder new Football Association regulations, only incidents that result in a player winning a penalty or lead to an opponent being sent off - through either a direct red card or two yellow cards - can be punished retrospectively with a suspension.\nThat means Van La Parra will face no further sanction for Saturday's incident, whereas he could have been banned had Kavanagh missed it.\nLast December, Dyche claimed retrospective bans would end diving within \"six months\" of being introduced.\n\"They've changed the rule, but they've changed it so negligibly,\" he said.\n\"In theory, if they were to get a penalty, score it and then he gets banned after the event after we've possibly lost the game... that can't be right. That should be effective now.\n\"It's not about that player, either, it's about the moment. That's unacceptable in football; I don't want my lad doing that and neither should children across the world be doing that.\"\nRelive Burnley's draw with Huddersfield as it happened\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League matches\nDyche praised Kavanagh's decision but added officials should have \"more power after the game\" to get diving \"out of football\".\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner said he did not see the incident but stated: \"If it was a dive, it's not what we want to see.\"\nThe Clarets and Terriers had played out a cagey affair with the first half featuring no shots on target, although Burnley striker Chris Wood should have done better as he headed wide from a Stephen Ward cross.\nHuddersfield had the better of the second half, but Laurent Depoitre and Tom Ince failed to convert their opportunities.\nGoing into the match, Burnley had won the same number of Premier League home matches (11) as Manchester United since August 2016, and only one fewer than Manchester City.\nBut Huddersfield never looked like being the latest victims, with German centre-back Christopher Schindler easily coping with the threat of Wood.\nA late flurry of substitutions failed to change the pattern of the game and Huddersfield and Burnley are eighth and ninth in the table respectively, with nine points from their opening six games.\nMan of the match - Christopher Schindler (Huddersfield)\nDefences on top - the stats\nBurnley (W1 D3) are unbeaten in four Premier League games for the first time since December 2014.\nThe Clarets' past three home league games have produced just two goals (one for, one against).\nAaron Mooy has now created 14 goalscoring chances in the Premier League for Huddersfield, twice as many as any of his team-mates.\nWhat the managers said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"They are very defence minded - I think they've only conceded three goals so far this season. We had our moments, some huffs and puffs but overall it's another good point on the board.\n\"Credit to them, they are having a fantastic start to the season. People imply that these are easy games, but there are no such things and I'm pleased.\n\"We calmed things down well when we had to, so there were good signs beyond the result I think.\"\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"It was a tight game, very even. Maybe they were the better side in the first half and we were better in the second half.\n\"I'm very pleased with our defensive work. Maybe we made too many mistakes in the first half. We spoke about it, then we had our moments.\n\"Everyone knows this is a difficult place to play. I'm OK with the result.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley have taken five points from visits to Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool so far this season and will look to continue their good away form at Everton on Sunday, 1 October (14:15 BST). For Huddersfield, it is a return to the John Smith's Stadium, with Spurs coming to West Yorkshire on 30 September at 12:30 BST."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-1 Bournemouth\nEverton substitute Oumar Niasse's two goals to turn defeat into victory against Bournemouth could prove a defining moment in the Toffees' season, says boss Ronald Koeman.\nThe Blues were trailing to Joshua King's sumptuous low 20-yard finish when Niasse was introduced in the 55th minute in place of Wayne Rooney, who had earlier been denied a penalty after being caught by Simon Francis' elbow.\nNiasse hammered the equaliser from a pass by fellow substitute Tom Davies before hooking home the winner from close range at Goodison Park.\nInstead of a fourth successive league defeat, Everton are up to 13th in the table after a second league win of the season.\n\"It is a totally different world after winning,\" said Koeman. \"You have key moments during the season and this was a big win that will give everyone a boost.\n\"It was a difficult game, we did not create many chances and we took the right decision after 1-0 down to try something different - play two strikers and go more direct.\n\"More credit to the players - Niasse and Davies. They did a good job after a difficult time.\"\nRooney was angry with referee Martin Atkinson for not punishing Francis and made his feelings known as he went off for treatment with blood pouring from a facial cut.\nJermain Defoe should have made it 2-0 soon after King's opener but was denied by Everton keeper Jordan Pickford. The Cherries remain 19th in the table - one point from safety.\n\"It is frustrating from our perspective to come here and put that kind of performance in and not get anything,\" said Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe.\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action from Goodison Park\nNew Everton goal hero?\nAfter going more than six and a half hours without a Premier League goal, Everton scored two in five minutes thanks to Senegal forward Niasse.\nThe 27-year-old netted four times in the top-flight last season but was unable to save Hull City from relegation having been sent there on loan.\nThis was his first league appearance for Everton since May 2016, manager Koeman having appeared to have made his mind up on Niasse soon after taking over.\n\"If he likes to play football, then he needs to leave Everton,\" said Koeman in August 2016.\nYet Everton's underwhelming start to the season - as well as lack of goals - prompted Koeman to give Niasse a place on the bench and the player endeared himself to Blues fans after replacing a battered and bruised Rooney.\nHis first goal was a thumping shot which gave Asmir Begovic no chance while his second was a clever finish from close range after the Bournemouth keeper had kept out his initial header.\nIn the corresponding fixture last season, Romelu Lukaku scored a hat-trick in a crushing 6-3 win. Everton fans have been crying out for a new goalscoring hero since the Belgian's summer move to Manchester United.\nNiasse might just be the man.\nRooney in the wars\nThe main talking point during a dreary first half was Bournemouth skipper Francis' elbow which went unpunished and left Rooney with a bloodied face.\nThe 31-year-old, making the 400th Premier League start of his career, immediately clutched his face yet Atkinson appeared to miss the incident as the game carried on.\n\"It is not really with intention but, yes, it is above his eye and it is totally open [the wound],\" added Koeman.\n\"The doctor said to me at half-time if it happened again we would need to change him. I changed him because we needed something different.\"\nHowe was adamant there was no malice in the challenge.\n\"He's caught Wayne but there is absolutely no intent to injure the player, I can say that for certain,\" he said.\nNot long after the elbow, Rooney was back in the wars as he landed awkwardly after a foul by Adam Smith, prompting his wound to open up and forcing him to leave the pitch for further treatment.\nTough defeat to take\nBournemouth appeared in control once King put them ahead with a delicious finish following Charlie Daniels' weighted pass.\nThe turning point came moments later when Defoe, with only the keeper to beat, was denied by Pickford after being put clean through.\nIn the end, Everton's late goals left Howe just as sick as on his last visit to Goodison when his side conceded six times.\nHowe had added pace on the wings by handing Junior Stanislas his first league start of the season, while former Liverpool midfielder Jordon Ibe was also recalled.\nYet Bournemouth were made to pay as they once again failed to deliver a clean sheet in the league despite a clearance off the line by Andrew Surman to deny Mason Holgate when the Cherries were leading.\nMan of the match - Oumar Niasse (Everton)\nBournemouth can't defend a lead - stats\nBournemouth have lost 28 points from winning positions in the Premier League since the start of last season - more than any other side in that period.\nEverton ended a run of 401 minutes without a goal in the Premier League.\nOnly Crystal Palace (0) have scored fewer first-half goals than Bournemouth in the Premier League this season.\nCharlie Daniels has provided nine Premier League assists overall, more than any other Bournemouth player in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nEverton turn their attention to the Europa League when they welcome Apollon Limassol from Cyprus to Goodison on Thursday (20:05 BST), before hosting Burnley in the league on Sunday, 1 October (14:15). Bournemouth have a week to prepare for the visit of Leicester City next Saturday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 5-0 Crystal Palace\nPremier League leaders Manchester City eventually overpowered a Crystal Palace side who became the first team in English Football League history to start a season with six defeats and no goals.\nCity were only top alphabetically before kick-off, but now lead neighbours Manchester United on goal difference after continuing a prolific start to the new campaign that has seen them score 22 goals in their past five matches.\nThey had to wait until the very end of the first half to find a way past an initially well-drilled Palace side, but the Eagles lost shape and belief after the break as City ran riot.\nLeroy Sane broke the deadlock with a stylish goal that saw him gallop into the area and lift David Silva's pass over the head of the hapless Scott Dann before prodding home.\nPalace must find the aspirin - Hodgson\nRelive Man City's dominant win\nHow the day's action unfolded\nAt that stage Palace still had hope, but that evaporated at the beginning of the second half thanks to two Raheem Sterling goals in the space of eight minutes.\nSterling made it 2-0 when he met a peach of a cross from Sane and then ended the game as a contest when he fired home Aguero's pull-back from close range.\nAguero, needing three goals to pass Eric Brook and become City's record scorer, joined the party with 11 minutes to go when he nodded home another Sane delivery.\nSubstitute Fabian Delph completed the rout to punish Palace further with a fierce strike into the top corner before the end.\nPalace hit the post but wait for a goal goes on\nThey ended up on the wrong end of a heavy defeat but you could argue Palace did far better than expected in the first half at the Etihad.\nDefending in numbers but breaking forward with pace, they almost ended their wait for a league goal this season when Ruben Loftus-Cheek saw his shot deflected on to a post.\nPalace's counter-attack raids gave City something to think about with the score at 0-0 but that plan went out of the window when Sane scored just before the break.\nHodgson's sides are known for their organisation and determination but they were run ragged in the second half and showed few signs they would end their goal drought.\nWith games against Manchester United and Chelsea to come, Hodgson has his work cut out to improve his side at both ends of the pitch - and quickly.\nCity attacking juggernaut gathers pace\nIt is now 630 minutes - or seven full games - since Crystal Palace last scored a Premier League goal, on 14 May.\nIn that time, City have scored 29 league goals in eight matches, and show no sign of stopping - whoever is in their line-up.\nGabriel Jesus, who has linked so effectively with Aguero up front this season, was an unused substitute on Saturday.\nThe Brazilian was not needed, and Bernardo Silva only came on for the last half-hour, as Sane staked his claim for a regular starting place and Sterling continued his fine form.\nWith David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne pulling the strings, Guardiola must be wondering who is in his strongest team because at the moment City score goals whoever is playing.\nThe only sour note of Guardiola's day was an injury which forced Benjamin Mendy off before the break and he believes it could be knee ligament damage.\n\"Without Mendy, we cannot attack fluently with our full-back down the left,\" said Guardiola.\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane\nProlific City, dire Eagles - the stats\nCrystal Palace are the only team in Europe's big five divisions yet to score a league goal this season.\nThis is Manchester City's best goal return after six league games (21).\nManchester City are the first side to score 5+ goals in three consecutive top-flight games in the same season since Blackburn did so in 1958-59.\nDavid Silva has been directly involved in seven goals in his last six Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace (four goals, three assists).\nLeroy Sane has scored five goals from just seven shots on target in all competitions for Man City this season.\n'First goal does the damage' - Manager reaction\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"The first half we had problems as the ball must be moved and we didn't move it.\n\"But the last 10-15 minutes of the half we got it. The second-half was much, much better. Sane's goal was so important. His first touch for the goal was brilliant. He runs in behind amazingly. Always the right tempo and moment.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"I thought at half-time to come in at 1-0 down is a bit unfortunate. I thought we'd played some good football.\n\"The goal before half-time was very damaging. We didn't defend anywhere near as well as we should have done for that goal.\"\nChampions League and Chelsea next for City\nCity entertain Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45 BST) and end the week with a serious test of their title credentials when they travel to play Chelsea (Saturday, 17:30).\n\"We will see what is our level when we face the last champions,\" was Guardiola's take on it. His side lost home and away to Antonio Conte's team last season.\nPalace are back in Manchester next Saturday when they play United at Old Trafford (15:00) in what is their last chance to get a league point or goal before the international break. Fail to manage that and they will have to wait until 14 October, when they play Chelsea, to get off the mark."

Now he has to continue this way to be a great striker,\" Conte said.\nBefore this match, Morata's three goals and two assists in the Premier League this season had been headers, but it did not take long for the 24-year-old to show there is more to his game.\nHe demonstrated a range of qualities, from his delicate touch to bring the ball down for his first goal, his mesmerising run and strength for the second and his goal-poachers' poke to complete the hat-trick.\nHughes' woes against Chelsea continue - the stats\nStoke have lost more Premier League games (14) and conceded more goals (42) against Chelsea than they have against any other side in the competition\nIndeed, Mark Hughes has lost 16 times and conceded 47 goals as a Premier League manager in 25 meetings against the Blues - his worst record against any top-flight club\nThe Potters have lost seven of their past 11 Premier League games at the Bet365 Stadium against the 'big six' - winning once and drawing the other three\nChelsea have won eight of their past nine league away games (L1), their best run over a nine-game period on the road since September 2009, when they also won eight and lost one\nSince 2016-17, only Diego Costa (29) has been involved in more goals in all competitions for Chelsea than Pedro (15 goals 12 assists)\n15 of Chelsea's past 16 goals have seen a Spaniard either score or assist\nAlvaro Morata is the 17th player to score a Premier League hat-trick for Chelsea - only Arsenal have had more scorers (19)\nNo player has been involved in more goals in their first six Premier League games for Chelsea than Alvaro Morata (8; 6 goals, 2 assists)\nMorata's strike came after only 82 seconds, the second fastest goal this season after Shinji Okazaki's for Leicester City against Brighton in August\n'The score flattered Chelsea'\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"It was a good day, a good result for us. Stoke are a really good team and very strong.\n\"It was very difficult to win here but we deserved to win the game. We started well and scored early and were in control of the game. I repeat, it's not simple to win away against them.\"\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"They will be delighted with a 4-0 score. It has flattered them somewhat.\n\"We made too many mistakes against a team who can exploit that. Defensive errors took it away from us.\n\"We were tested a little bit when it comes to personnel. Today we were missing five centre-backs. Circumstances meant that we weren't getting anything out of it.\""

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-2 Watford\nRicharlison struck in the 90th minute as Watford survived a Swansea City fightback to claim a dramatic win at the Liberty Stadium.\nAndre Gray seized on hesitant home defending to put the Hornets in front from close range, and the abject Swans were arguably lucky not to be further behind at the break.\nHowever, two half-time substitutions changed the course of the game and one of the replacements, Tammy Abraham, scored the equaliser after Wilfried Bony's initial shot was saved.\nBut after a spell of Swansea pressure, Richarlison stole the ball from Roque Mesa and evaded Alfie Mawson to scamper clear and score despite a touch from keeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nA third victory from six Premier League games was the perfect riposte to last weekend's 6-0 thrashing by Manchester City, and gives Watford three consecutive top-flight away wins for the first time in their history as they rise to sixth in the table.\nBut for Swansea, who remain 14th, losing their first three home games of the season for the first time in their history gives head coach Paul Clement cause for concern.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League fixtures\nRelive Watford's late win over Swansea\nWatford recover from a hammering\nDespite that mauling at the hands of Manchester City a week ago, two wins and two draws had represented an encouraging start to life under Marco Silva for Watford.\nThe Hornets appeared to bear no scarring from that demolition at Vicarage Road as they made an assertive start, out-witting their opponents with crisp, one-touch passing and an urgency in attack which left Swansea looking ponderous and lethargic.\nThe dynamic of the game was encapsulated by the opening goal, as Andre Carrillo's low cross was only half-blocked by Sam Clucas, whose untimely intervention served to set up Gray for an emphatic finish in the top corner.\nWatford were in total control and, although they could have scored a second goal had Carrillo not strayed offside, Silva may have been disappointed his side failed to turn their domination into a healthier lead.\nThe Portuguese certainly seemed irked on the touchline as Swansea equalised and gathered momentum in their search for a winner in the second half.\nBut Silva and Watford were reprieved when Mesa was dispossessed, allowing Richarlison to race clear, beat Mawson's weak challenge and score with a shot which clipped the crossbar on its way in.\nSwansea's Jekyll and Hyde form\nSwansea's season had been a tale of contrasting home and away form, keeping clean sheets in all three of their league matches on the road but failing to score in either of their games at the Liberty Stadium.\nIn the build-up to this match, Clement had called for an improvement in attack and, in an attempt to revitalise his frontline, he gave striker Bony a first league start since his transfer deadline day return from Manchester City.\nHowever, that change made no difference to the misfiring Swans, whose first-half display against Watford was so listless that the home fans were booing and heckling their side's backward passes after less than half an hour.\nThe midfield three of Clucas, Tom Carroll and Leroy Fer lacked balance, almost entirely devoid of dynamism and creativity as they let the game pass them by.\nClement sensed as much and made two changes at the break, replacing Clucas with Mesa and bringing forward Abraham on for centre-back Mike van der Hoorn as he ditched the 5-3-2 formation for a more attacking 4-3-3 system.\nIt had the desired effect as Swansea were unrecognisable in the second half, playing with far greater intensity and pace.\nAbraham's goal led to a prolonged spell of pressure from the hosts but, for all their possession and territory, their paucity of clear scoring opportunities spoke volumes of the team's glaring weakness: a lack of creativity and goals.\nMan of the match - Kiko Femenia\nThe 34-year wait is over - stats\nWatford won their first away league game versus Swansea since February 1983, ending a five-game winless run.\nSwansea have lost three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time under one manager since January 2014 under Michael Laudrup.\nRicharlison has scored with two of his three shots on target in the Premier League.\nAndre Gray netted his first league goal in 510 minutes of action.\nTammy Abraham has scored in three of his past six appearances in all competitions for Swansea, with this his first strike at the Liberty Stadium.\nTroy Deeney, who assisted Richarlison's winner, made his first goal contribution in 12 Premier League appearances.\n'I feel disappointed for the fans'\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: \"We were trying to push to win and not lose. In the first half we played poorly. We changed in the second half, got back in it, pushed to win but we gifted them two goals.\n\"We weren't good enough over the 90. You can't just play well for 40 minutes.\n\"I feel disappointed for the fans. They've come to three home games and they've seen three loses. We've got to get a result away from home now.\"\nWatford manager Marco Silva: \"I'm really happy with the result. A third away victory in a row and I'm sure that's a first for the club.\n\"It's important the players don't lose focus and keep believing. When you believe, anything can happen.\n\"Our players work really hard and we're starting to build something in the changing room. Everyone is together and it's important to continue this way.\"\nWhat's next?\nSwansea travel to West Ham next Saturday while Watford go to West Brom (both 15:00 BST)."

Let's make the next step together.\"\nFoxes come away with nothing\nCraig Shakespeare's first match as Leicester manager back in February was a win over Liverpool and his Foxes side was surely buoyed by their cup victory on Tuesday.\nTheir game plan will have focused on exposing the Reds' well-documented defensive frailties and it almost got them a point.\nVardy was a constant menace and it was no surprise when he got his customary goal, while Liverpool's vulnerability when defending crosses was exposed for Okazaki's scrambled effort.\nThe England forward was again causing alarm in the visiting defence when his blocked effort fouind its way to substitute Daniel Sturridge, who orchestrated a counter attack that led to Henderson's cool finish for Liverpool's ultimately decisive third.\nShakespeare said: \"I am struggling to digest it myself. You come in after contributing to another fabulous game of football but ultimately we've come away with nothing.\n\"The disappointing thing for me was at 2-1 down we conceded a third goal. It was a difficult game for us - it ebbed and flowed but we go away disappointed.\"\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho\nMignolet the penalty king\nSince joining Liverpool for the 2013-14 season, Simon Mignolet has saved seven of the 15 Premier League penalties he's faced; more than any other keeper.\nSince beating Liverpool at the King Power last season, the Foxes have lost each of their last seven Premier League games against the 'big six' teams, conceding 20 goals.\nLiverpool have conceded 10 goals in their last three Premier League away games; the most the Reds have ever conceded over a three-game period on the road in the competition.\nJamie Vardy has bagged six goals in his last four Premier League games against Liverpool - the most he has scored against any Premier League side.\nPhilippe Coutinho has scored more goals from outside the box than any other player in the Premier League since his debut (16).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to AFC Bournemouth next Saturday (15:00 BST) while Liverpool are in Champions League action on Tuesday against Spartak Moscow (19:45 BST) before facing Newcastle on Sunday, 1 October in the Premier League."

But we know it'll be tougher. Anything you can get from that is a bonus.\n\"If we do things well and to the best of our abilities, we can compete with a group of teams.

How much do you know about Gareth Barry?\nThe latest Football Daily podcast\nLuckless night for the Baggies\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis cut an exasperated figure on the touchline as his poor record at the Emirates continued. He has now lost all 10 of the matches he has managed at the ground.\nPulis was furious when a penalty was not given for Mustafi's tackle on Rodriguez and also disagreed with the decision to a give a free-kick in the build-up to Lacazette's first goal, when the contact from Jonny Evans on Mohamed Elneny looked minimal.\nFormer Arsenal defender and BBC Radio 5 live pundit Martin Keown agreed, saying the Baggies should \"definitely\" have had a penalty and calling the Evans foul \"doubtful\".\nHowever, Pulis was expressionless when Madley did point to the spot in the second half and, in truth, could have few complaints.\nIt was a foolish shoulder charge from Nyom on Ramsey after the Arsenal midfielder had shown too much pace to surge around the Cameroon defender and into the box.\nArsenal also had a penalty appeal turned down in the first half when Grzegorz Krychowiak pulled the shirt of Sanchez at a corner.\nWest Brom have scored just four goals this season but could easily have added to that in the first half with Rodriguez a constant threat.\nAs well as the Englishman's header that was cleared off the line and the shot which followed the penalty decision, he came within inches of converting a cross from the right when sliding full-stretch towards goal.\nBut, despite the improved attacking display, the Baggies are now five games without a victory and have won only one of 12 away league matches in 2017.\nSigns of momentum for Arsenal?\nAs in last week's battling 0-0 draw at Chelsea, Arsenal were not at their best but they are now five games unbeaten in all competitions.\nLacazette's performance was a clear positive for manager Arsene Wenger, who also gave a start to Sanchez for only the second time this season, following the Chile international's collapsed move to Manchester City in the summer.\nIt was the first time the pair had started a Premier League game together and it was Sanchez who provided the assist for Lacazette's opener.\nQuestions have been asked of Sanchez's attitude after he failed to get his summer move, but he worked hard on his first start since the Gunners' 4-0 defeat at Liverpool.\nHe went close with a free-kick before the similar effort which set up the opener and won 25 of his duels, more than any other player. He was given a standing ovation by the home crowd when substituted in the 83rd minute.\nArsenal may not be showing the eye-catching form of their top-four rivals in Manchester - with City and United level on points at the top of the table - but they are slowly starting to improve after a poor start.\n\"There are little partnerships building in the team,\" Keown said.\n\"Sead Kolasinac looks really strong in this side. Ramsey is playing with confidence, Lacazette looks a threat and Sanchez is back in the team and looks happy to be so. That is a plus for Wenger.\"\nRecord-breaker Barry\nEver the professional, Barry expressed disappointment after his side fell to defeat on the night he played his 633rd Premier League game, taking him past former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs' record.\nThe 36-year-old Englishman was his solid self, the most impressive moment coming when he played an excellent pass to through to Rodriguez for the Baggies' first-half penalty appeal.\nBarry was congratulated by his manager, previous clubs, former team-mates and England boss Gareth Southgate before Monday's match.\n\"Gareth has been a wonderful professional and still is - and we hope he keeps performing like that until the end of the season,\" Pulis said.\nBarry told BBC Sport: \"It was something different this week, having a lot of media attention. It will be nice to put this milestone to bed.\n\"I've not really given it too much thought about who is behind me. There is so much concentration on what you are doing.\"\n'The referee should pull it back' - what they said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"They pushed us very hard, especially in the first half. They disturbed our build-up and played a very dangerous and direct game. In the second half I felt we controlled the game and did not give anything away.\n\"If [the West Brom penalty] had been given I would not have said it is a scandal. Looking at the decision again he made the right decision.\n\"You are never too honest. I believe [Rodriguez] saw an opportunity he could score.\"\nOn Lacazette: \"He gets stronger in every game. Good first touch and movement. He is young and just arrived in England. The physical demands are very high.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis on the refereeing decisions: \"It is part of the game and things didn't go for us today.\n\"The great thing [with the challenge on Rodriguez] is that everybody has seen it so I don't have to comment on it.\n\"We tell our players not to roll about. He still wanted to score but once he has missed the referee should pull it back. It could be a penalty and they could have a player sent off, so we not only score but are against a team down to 10 players.\n\"We have got to start taking chances. We have given Arsenal a good game, but we had to chase it in the second half and that suited Arsenal.\"\nWenger's impressive record against Pulis - the best stats\nWenger has won all 11 of his home games against teams managed by Pulis, 10 in the Premier League and one FA Cup game at Highbury in 2005.\nWest Brom have lost more away Premier League games against Arsenal (10) than against any other side.\nLacazette became the first Arsenal player to score in his first three home league appearances for the club since Brian Marwood in September 1988.\nLacazette also scored Arsenal's 100th penalty in the Premier League - only Liverpool (112) and Chelsea (107) have scored more.\nArsenal have scored in all 23 of their Premier League meetings with West Brom, the best such 100% record in the division.\nEach of the Gunners' past seven home wins have come on a different day of the week.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Belarus to play BATE Borisov in the Europa League on Thursday (18:00 BST kick-off) before hosting Brighton in the Premier League on Sunday, 1 October (12:00).\nMeanwhile, West Brom entertain Watford in the league on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur\nHarry Kane said he has probably had his \"best month\" after taking his September goal tally to 13 with two in the victory at Huddersfield.\nThe 24-year-old bettered his personal record for goals scored in a calendar month as the Terriers became the fifth club side to suffer at the hands of the England marksman this month.\n\"It's nice. I feel good, I feel confident when these boys are up the pitch putting in good crosses and through balls and I'm just there to put them away,\" he said.\n\"I'm delighted with the win, it's been a great week for the team, and we've just got to continue that after the international break.\"\nKane delivered his first blow inside 10 minutes when he collected Kieran Trippier's header, ran into the Huddersfield area and slotted past keeper Jonas Lossl.\nIt was 2-0 soon after. This time Ben Davies demonstrated his poise in front of goal with a good strike after great combination play from Kane, Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen.\nThe goal of the match came barely midway into the half. Kane was again fed by Trippier before he drifted across the 18-yard area and bent a brilliant effort past Danish keeper Lossl.\nSpurs eased off after the break but still managed a fourth goal when substitute Moussa Sissoko claimed his first for the club with a deflected effort from close range.\nLaurent Depoitre's strike against the crossbar, and Tommy Smith's fierce shot that produced a good save from Hugo Lloris, were Huddersfield's only chances of note.\nSpurs move up to third in the Premier League while Huddersfield are 10th.\nRelive the action from the John Smith's Stadium\nCan Kane get any better?\nAre there any superlatives left to describe Harry Kane?\nHis 13 goals in a month equals the best efforts of Barcelona's Lionel Messi (13 in March 2012) and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo (13 in October 2010). If this form continues, he, like the other two, will be considered for and might even win the most coveted prizes in world football.\nThe two strikes against the Terriers once again highlighted his all-around abilities as a striker.\nThe first was about anticipation and coping with a one-on-one situation. Trippier's header should have been cleared by Chris Lowe, but with Kane breathing down his neck, the defender missed his kick and the striker pounced. The England man then waited for the right moment before threading his strike past Lossl.\nThe second was spectacular. It was the kind of effort that team-mate Eriksen would produce, but this time it was Kane with the stunning strike after he made space for himself near the edge of the area.\nAfter 11 games last season Kane had scored six goals - his tally is almost double that this campaign. And that includes him not finding the net in August at all.\n\"If you look at the goals to games it's probably the best month I've had, especially after August,\" Kane said.\nListen: \"Kane will need more silverware to become the world's best\"\nAlli 'must learn' after booking for simulation\nMidfielder Alli was given a yellow card for simulation by referee Neil Swarbrick in the second half, in the same week he was banned from playing for England for one game because of a middle finger gesture.\nAlli received a pass through on goal and with Huddersfield goalkeeper Lossl closing in, threw himself to the ground despite not being touched.\nManager Mauricio Pochettino said his player \"needs to learn\" and improve his on-field behaviour.\nThe Argentine said: \"This type of action does not help him, does not help the club and does not help football. We are talking these last few years about fair play and being honest.\n\"He has improved a lot but still there is that little bit he must learn.\"\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer said Alli was \"blatantly trying to cheat\".\nSpeaking on Match of the Day, he said: \"Alli is 21 but there comes a time when he have to stop saying 'he has to learn'. That time is now.\n\"You would think - after being banned from playing for England for a middle finger gesture - that he'd want to stay out of trouble.\"\nHeavy defeat, but no shame\nIt is not often a team can hold their heads high after a 4-0 beating, but Huddersfield played well.\nThe Spurs defence looked jittery in the opening eight minutes as David Wagner's men pressed and almost scored through Smith, whose strike stung the palms of Lloris.\nAnd even after they went 3-0 down, Town did not lose their desire to attack, going close again when Depoitre's venomous strike came off the bar.\nTottenham dropped off the pace and tightened up after the break, perhaps to avoid a repeat of last weekend when West Ham scored twice after Spurs had gone 3-0 up.\nHuddersfield found it harder to find space before they suffered a final blow when Sissoko scored his first goal for the club.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We deserved the victory, we were better. Until today Huddersfield only conceded three goals, and we scored four. We dominated the game and that is why I am so happy with everyone.\n\"We played Champions League in Cyprus, arrived back home late and then to show the energy and performance is fantastic for us.\n\"Kane is in an amazing moment. He is scoring goals, his energy is fantastic. The way he works without the ball. I wish he keeps going at the same level and for the team to win games.\"\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"It felt a little like it was over shortly after it started.\n\"We wanted to be brave and attack them. We had some dangerous moments, but the goals we gave away were too easy.\n\"We made too many easy mistakes before the goal. The second goal was high quality, but we did clear the ball although to one of their players [Davies] before he scored.\n\"We have to give credit to Tottenham. They deserved to win this game. It was a difference in class between them and us.\"\nSpurs' goalfest continues\nHuddersfield conceded more goals in this game than in their previous six Premier League games combined (three).\nTottenham have won each of their opening four league away games for the first time since 1960-61, when they won their first eight in a row.\nSpurs have scored 25 goals in their last six Premier League away matches; an average of more than four per game (4.2).\nSince Mauricio Pochettino took charge in 2014-15, Tottenham have won more points against newly promoted teams than any other Premier League side (58).\nKane has scored against 25 of the 26 teams he has faced in the Premier League, only failing to find the back of the net against Cardiff City (two apps, 0 goals).\nKane is only the second player in Premier League history to score two-plus goals in three consecutive away appearances in the competition (the other being Dennis Bergkamp in 1997).\nSix of Trippier's nine Premier League assists for Spurs have been for Kane, with all of them coming away from home.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Huddersfield are at Swansea City and Spurs are at home to Bournemouth. Both matches are on Saturday, 14 October and kick off at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 4-0 Crystal Palace\nManchester United put in a dominant performance to beat a terrible Crystal Palace, who have lost all seven Premier League games this season without scoring.\nUnbeaten United led within three minutes when Marcus Rashford's excellent work on the left wing ended with a cut-back to Juan Mata, who steered home from 10 yards out.\nTheir second came when Ashley Young crossed for Marouane Fellaini to volley home from two yards out at the back post.\nFellaini scored his second goal with a close-range header from Rashford's free-kick early in the second half.\nRomelu Lukaku scored a late fourth - his 11th goal in 10 United games - by converting Anthony Martial's cross from close range.\nThe result took United top for a couple of hours, until Manchester City beat Chelsea 1-0 to overtake them on goal difference again. Palace remain bottom.\nPalace like an \"outclassed boxer\" - Hodgson\nRelive the action as it happened\nReaction to all Saturday's games\nFree-scoring United win with ease\nUnited continued their fantastic goalscoring start to the season - they have now netted 33 times in 11 games - and, against very limited opposition, they could have won by more, falling just short of matching City's 5-0 victory over the Eagles a week ago.\nThe Red Devils only landed back in Manchester at 04:00 GMT on Thursday after the 4-1 Champions League win at CSKA Moscow. But, having made five changes from that game, they did not look tired at all.\nIn fact, they led after only three minutes when Rashford, who replaced Anthony Martial in the line-up, beat Joel Ward with some excellent skill before setting up Mata - another of those recalled - on the Spaniard's 200th Premier League appearance.\nFellaini then scored twice, from crosses by Young and Rashford.\nUnited eased up at this point - there would have been more goals available had they maintained the level of their early performance. But they did get another when Lukaku, who has failed to score in only one of his United games, lashed home Martial's cross late on.\nJose Mourinho's side had other chances - Chris Smalling headed just wide, Rashford and Martial were denied by good Wayne Hennessey saves, and Lukaku dragged a shot inches wide having sent the keeper the wrong way.\nPalace's record-breaking start continues\nNo team in 129 years of the Football League had ever lost their first six league games without scoring - until Palace reached that landmark last week. That record is now extended to seven matches.\nThe Eagles were relatively organised in defence - this is the fourth time in five games United have scored four goals after all. But Roy Hodgson's side were so short of confidence - or ideas - going forward.\nWith Christian Benteke ruled out for six weeks, and few other options, they lacked anyone to hold onto the ball up front. Bakary Sako, a winger, had to play as the central forward but he is no target man.\nThey do have one striker - 24-year-old Freddie Ladapo, who came on for his debut in the second half. Most of his goals have come for non-league Grays and Margate, and his previous appearance was for Shrewsbury against Walsall in April.\nHaving struggled to score with Benteke, they never looked like doing so without him. Their six shots against United, only one on target from Sako, were mostly from distance.\nYou have to go back two managers - to Sam Allardyce - to the last time Palace scored or picked up a point in the Premier League. Frank de Boer was only given four league games, and Hodgson - who has a huge task on his hands - has now had three.\nIt is still early days, but if they do not start improving, they could join Swindon Town, Derby County, Portsmouth, Sunderland and Aston Villa on the list of worst teams in Premier League history.\nMan of the match - Marouane Fellaini (Manchester United)\nManager reaction - Mourinho hails two-goal Fellaini\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho praised oft-maligned midfielder Fellaini, who scored twice in one match for the club for the first time.\nThe Belgian was strongly linked with a move to Galatasaray in the summer.\n\"I always trusted Marouane since day one and try to give him confidence and show him how useful he is for the team,\" Mourinho told BBC Sport.\n\"Sometimes we like players others don't like. Some players perform better with some of us [managers] than with others and I have examples of players that didn't perform well for me and then performed well for other managers.\n\"I think Marouane has important qualities and I try to use them depending on the situation and what they team needs. He plays with me as a defensive midfielder, as a second striker, as one of two midfielders. He is a team player. A great character. We have a good relationship and things are going really well between us.\n\"I think only a strong character could resist the difficulties here because he had some difficult times when people didn't recognise his qualities, when other managers didn't like so much the qualities he has. He had to be a strong character. He is a fighter, a guy with lots of pride and I am really pleased I helped him reach this level and change the perception the fans have now. I am really happy for him.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson said: \"The quality these teams have, they don't miss chances.\n\"Coming into the game this week, we thought if things go our way, we could have got something out of the game.\n\"The messages being put across are being grasped by the players. We now have Chelsea and it doesn't get any easier.\n\"The past three weeks' work has been good but this break will be good to get more work done. The fans are brilliant and that support will help us through.\"\nMatch stats - Palace on brink of more unwanted history\nIf Crystal Palace fail to score against Chelsea in their next game, they will equal Halifax's 1990-91 record of eight games without scoring a goal at the start of a Football League season.\nPalace have lost eight consecutive league games without scoring (going back into last season), the joint-longest run in English league history alongside Hartlepool (1970 and 1993) and Sunderland (1977).\nThe Eagles remain the only team in Europe's big five leagues yet to score a league goal this season.\nManchester United have never lost a Premier League game against Palace (W14 D3 L0). The Red Devils have set a Premier League record for most games without losing to a single opponent.\nPalace are only the second team to lose their opening seven games in a Premier League season, after Portsmouth in 2009-10.\nMarouane Fellaini has scored three goals from four shots in the Premier League so far in 2017-18 - more than in the previous two seasons combined (two goals from 46 shots).\nJuan Mata, who made his 200th Premier League appearance (the seventh Spanish player to reach this feat), ended a run of 809 minutes without a league goal.\nMarcus Rashford has had a hand in nine goals in his past 10 games for United in all competitions (five goals, four assists).\nRashford provided two assists in a single competitive game for the first time in his United career.\nUnited kept five consecutive Premier League clean sheets at Old Trafford for the first time since a seven-game run in March 2010 under Sir Alex Ferguson.\nAnalysis - 'You fear for Palace'\nFormer England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live\nIt's an easy victory for Manchester United. Roy Hodgson set his stall out, had them organised but Manchester United were deserved winners and cruised through this game.\nPalace are low on confidence and belief. It's going to be a massive job for Hodgson to turn this round. On today's performance, you fear for them.\nHodgson's worked hard - you can see that from the shape of their team - but they had a terrible start and their heads dropped.\nIn the second half they had a bit of the ball but that's because Manchester United stepped off the pace and let them have it. They didn't ever threaten David de Gea.\nWhat's next?\nThe Premier League returns in two weeks, after the international break. United have arguably their toughest test of the season - at arch-rivals Liverpool (12:30 BST on Saturday, 14 October).\nPalace continue their run of facing the three title favourites in a row. They are at home to Chelsea at 15:00 BST that day."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-0 Leicester City\nBournemouth failed to convert a host of chances as both their and Leicester's disappointing starts to the Premier League season continued with a goalless draw at Dean Court.\nThe home side dominated the game and will feel they should have had an early penalty when Leicester defender Danny Simpson appeared to handle inside the box.\nAfter home striker Jermain Defoe scooped the lively Joshua King's low cross against the bar, Marc Pugh's follow-up shot ricocheted off the raised right hand of Simpson.\nThe Bournemouth players protested strongly to referee Graham Scott but he waved play on.\nHaving seen a video replay of the handball after the match, Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe said: \"It's clear cut. If the referee didn't see it he can't give it, but it is a stone-waller [definite penalty]\".\nThe best chance of the second half fell to Leicester's Shinji Okazaki, who side-footed wide from around 10 yards out.\nThe draw leaves Bournemouth second from bottom and Leicester only one place outside the relegation zone, with both sides having won just once in their opening seven league matches.\nCook shines for dominant Bournemouth\nDespite the result, there are many positives Howe can take from his side's performance.\nHowe made two changes to the team which lost to Everton last Saturday, with Pugh and Lewis Cook both returning to the starting line-up, and midfielder Cook was particularly impressive as Bournemouth began the game with great intensity.\nThe 20-year-old, making only his second league start of the season, showed quick feet and awareness, and produced 69 passes with an accuracy of 85.5%.\nBournemouth had several opportunities to take the lead after the early penalty appeal.\nNorway striker King scuffed a shot wide from the edge of the box while the best chance of the first half fell to Pugh, who blasted over the bar from eight yards after Leicester failed to clear.\nLeicester offer little attacking threat\nBournemouth kept their first clean sheet in 10 Premier League home games, but the Cherries had very little to worry about defensively, particularly in the first half.\nFoxes forward Jamie Vardy, who went into the game having scored 13 goals in 19 Premier League games under boss Craig Shakespeare, was rarely involved in play as Bournemouth nullified any Leicester attacks.\nShakespeare, who gave winger Demarai Gray his first start of the season in place of Riyad Mahrez, conceded that his side \"didn't have that sharpness or quality on the ball and offensively weren't the threat\" he expected them to be.\nDespite Bournemouth's dominance, Leicester had a chance to take the lead through Okazaki in the second half, after a brief lapse in concentration by the Bournemouth defence handed the Japan international a clear shot on goal from close range.\n\"Whether we deserved to have the chance or not is irrelevant, I expected him to put that away,\" said Shakespeare.\nMan of the match - Lewis Cook (Bournemouth)\nEnough chances to win three or four games - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was a very good performance, we created enough to win three or four games. We started really fast and had a number of chances - in the future I think we'll score plenty.\n\"I'm really enthused by the performance. I'm pleased to get our first clean sheet and that's a huge moment in the season as well.\"\nLeicester City manager Craig Shakespeare: \"It was a hard earned point. We know we could do a lot better. We started slowly and gave them momentum and it was hard to get with the pace of the game.\n\"The penalty, I didn't see it but I was told it could have been a penalty. We had one last week which didn't go our way and I think these things can even themselves up.\"\nBournemouth and Leicester's woes - the stats\nBournemouth have earned just four points from their seven Premier League games this term, fewer than in both 2015-16 (seven) and 2016-17 (eight) at this stage of the season.\nBournemouth are unbeaten in all five Premier League meetings with Leicester City, although four have ended level (W1 D4 L0).\nJermain Defoe (29) had fewer touches of the ball than any other Bournemouth outfield player to start the match, and he did not have a shot on target (although did hit the bar).\nLeicester City have earned just five points from seven games so far this season, their joint-lowest return at this stage of a Premier League campaign alongside 1994-95, 2001-02 and 2003-04.\nLeicester have won just once in their past 10 Premier League matches under Craig Shakespeare (W1 D3 L6), this after winning seven of the first 10 under his stewardship.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Wembley after the international break to take on Tottenham on Saturday, 14 October (15:00 BST), before an away game at Stoke City on 21 October (15:00 BST), and then a home fixture against champions Chelsea on 28 October (17:30 BST).\nLeicester City host West Brom on Monday, 16 October (20:00 BST), travel to Swansea on 21 October (15:00 BST), then welcome Everton on 29 October (16:00 GMT)"

The guys on the bench lifted the team and crowd.\"\nSwansea were positive with their approach but a long-range effort from Wilfried Bony, parried by Joe Hart, in the first half was the best they had to show for their endeavour.\nRelive West Ham's match with Swansea as it happened\nReaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League matches\nBilic's double switch makes the difference\nHome fans chanted \"sacked in the morning\" at Bilic when his side trailed 3-0 in a 3-2 defeat by Tottenham last weekend.\nFor the most of this contest there was little respite for the Croat as his side laboured against a disciplined and organised Swansea side.\nIndeed there were jeers and boos for Bilic's double substitution when Masuaku and Sakho were introduced for Javier Hernandez and Andre Ayew.\nUltimately, the 49-year-old's decision to throw on both players made the difference, though, as Masuaku's superb run and cross found Sakho's perfectly timed run.\nWith West Ham's next three matches against Burnley, Brighton and Crystal Palace, Bilic will hope the confidence from this victory can spur his side on to greater things.\nSwansea solid but lack cutting edge\nSwansea managed just 10 shots on target before this encounter, which head coach Paul Clement blamed on a hectic end to the transfer window.\nTheir play was largely tidy and they used the ball intelligently, with Renato Sanches in particular catching the eye for the visitors.\nHowever, there was a stark lack of cutting edge to Swansea's play. Despite the presence of Tammy Abraham, Jordan Ayew and Bony - for the first half at least - they managed just one shot on target in the entire contest.\n\"A combination of the delivery and the movement need to be better in the final third,\" Clement said. \"We are closer to getting the balance right, but there is still work to be done.\"\nSwansea's first away defeat sent them into the bottom three and, unless Clement gives them more bite in attack, another relegation battle beckons this season.\nMan of the match - Andy Carroll (West Ham)\nSwans lose away record - the stats\nThis game produced a total of just 15 shots; only Burnley v Huddersfield on 23 September featured fewer in the top flight this season (13).\nWest Ham have registered three clean sheets in their last four Premier League games, after managing none in the five before that.\nSwansea conceded their first away Premier League goal in 495 minutes of action and suffered their first away defeat of the season.\nFour of the 10 Premier League games where winning goals have been scored in the 90th minute or later in 2017 so far have been against Swansea.\nDiafra Sakho netted his first Premier League goal since November 2016, when he scored against Manchester United.\nSix of West Ham's seven league goals this season have come in the second half, which equates to a league-high 86% proportion.\n'Fans have a right to their opinion' - what they said\nWest Ham goalkeeper Joe Hart: \"It was a difficult atmosphere in some ways. I'm never going to criticise the fans, they come here and pay their money and have a right to their opinion.\n\"We have to focus on the win. We have had seven points since the international break [at the beginning of September].\n\"It is on all of us to take the pressure off. We don't get sucked into the speculation, we just stick together and fight hard.\"\nSwansea head coach Paul Clement: \"I think the result was a little harsh in that I don't think that they weren't better than us as such.\n\"We just did not defend that last attack very well. They created a really good scoring chance, which is what we didn't do.\n\"We did not stop the cross coming in, did not defend it in the box and if you concede that late you do not give yourself much chance.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"\"We did not play well in the first half after a good first 10 minutes, making basic mistakes and Swansea were much better on the ball. We have to play better and we can play better.\n\"The changes were crucial with Manuel Lanzini, Arthur Masuaku and Diafra Sakho coming on.\n\"We played a very offensive formation in the first half but lacked the link between the defence and attack and that was why Lanzini made a big impact.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham face a tricky trip to Burnley on Saturday, 14 October (15:00 BST), while Swansea host newly promoted Huddersfield at the Liberty Stadium at the same time on the same day.\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 2-2 Watford\nRicharlison scored an injury-time equaliser as Watford came from two goals down to save a point at West Bromwich Albion.\nThe Baggies scored twice in three first-half minutes through Salomon Rondon and captain Jonny Evans, before Abdoulaye Doucoure reduced the deficit before the break.\nThe hosts looked set to record a first Premier League win since 19 August when Brazil Under-20 international Richarlison connected with a Jose Holebas free-kick deep into added time.\nThe result means Watford maintain their unbeaten record on the road this season.\nRelive West Brom's draw with Watford as it happened\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League matches\nThe Hornets started the match stronger and dominated possession throughout, but the first two clear-cut opportunities went to West Brom, who took them both.\nFirst Rondon shrugged off Christian Kabasele to get onto a Grzegorz Krychowiak pass before finishing past Heurelho Gomes from an acute angle.\nEvans doubled the lead after Matt Phillips' whipped corner came off the top of Doucoure's head straight into the path of the Northern Irishman.\nDoucoure made amends before half-time, finishing a neat passing move involving Troy Deeney and Richarlison, who was finally rewarded for being a threat when he netted in the 95th minute.\nMarco Silva's side move up to fifth, while West Brom climb to 10th.\nHornets loving life on the road\nThe visitors moved the ball well and had almost two thirds of the possession at The Hawthorns.\nHaving won league games at Bournemouth, Southampton and Swansea already this season, Richarlison's late goal means Watford have taken 10 points from a possible 12 away from home.\nThey have already equalled their tally of Premier League away wins last season, and are halfway to their highest number in a campaign.\nBut they will want to match that at home, with the Hertfordshire side having taken just two points from a possible nine at Vicarage Road.\nInjury-time equaliser 'hard to take' for Pulis\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis accepted his side switched off as Watford scored their late equaliser.\nHowever, the former Stoke boss was unhappy with the decision to award the free-kick from which it was scored.\nReferee Michael Oliver adjudged James McClean had fouled Richarlison, and showed the Republic of Ireland international a yellow card.\n\"When you're playing into the 95th minute of four minutes' added time and they score that's very hard to take,\" said Pulis.\n\"The challenge was a good tackle. He plays the ball. A sliding challenge. Oliver was 10 yards away and sees it perfectly and then gives a free-kick.\"\n'We kept believing' - what they said\nWatford manager Marco Silva: \"I believe nobody in the stadium or watching it would say we didn't deserve the point. We came here to play our game with our philosophy and we knew that would involve taking risks\n\"They want that - to sit and wait for our mistakes. But we don't change because that's our way. In some moments we were too slow in the first half. I told our players at half-time: 'If you continue the same way we'll achieve a good result.'\n\"Richarlison is an amazing talent. I told my board I want this player because I believe in him. We never know how he'll react coming from Brazil. Brazilian players can have problems in another country but he's been really good.\"\nWatford midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure: \"You could see with Jose Holebas, he was tackling five minutes before and then got the assist. We kept believing until the end and that's what you get.\n\"We have to be thankful for the fans because they're always behind us.\"\nWest Brom defender Jonny Evans: \"We had a good start to the season and we've tailed off a bit maybe.\n\"But it's still early days. We have nine points, which is something we can build on.\"\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Watford)\nBad day for the Baggies - the stats\nThis was the first time West Brom failed to win a Premier League match they were two goals ahead in since nearly two years to the day (WBA 2-3 Everton - 28 September 2015).\nBefore today, Watford's Premier League record in the 52 games in which they have trailed by two goals was W1 D0 L51 - the only other time they have picked up points being a 4-2 win at West Ham last September.\nSalomon Rondon scored a Premier League goal at The Hawthorns for the first time since December 2016, ending a run of 13 league appearances there without a goal.\nFive of Jonny Evans' eight Premier League goals have been headers following corners. He also scored against Watford at The Hawthorns for WBA last season in the Premier League - this was also a header from a corner in the first half.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure has scored three goals in seven Premier League appearances for Watford this season. The only top-flight campaign in which he has scored more is 2013-14 (six in 20) for Rennes in Ligue 1.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Watford host Arsenal on Saturday, 14 October (17:30 BST), while West Brom travel to Leicester City on Monday, 16 October (20:00 BST)."

We got over the line in the end.\"\nRelive all the action from Stoke against Southampton\nWhat happened today in the Premier League?\nMame Biram Diouf's header put the hosts ahead and they should have doubled their lead a minute later.\nVirgil van Dijk, making his first league start since January for Saints, brought down Saido Berahino in the box but his penalty was saved by Fraser Forster.\nSouthampton equalised through the unlikely source of Maya Yoshida but Crouch came off the bench to secure the three points.\nHe was the difference as Stoke beat Southampton 1-0 at St Mary's in May - a game in which Saints enjoyed the majority of the possession but were poor in the final third.\nAnd it was a similar story at the Bet365 Stadium where their chronic lack of confidence in front of goal showed.\nMauricio Pellegrino's side fell behind when Diouf was left unmarked in the box and nodded in from Xherdan Shaqiri's corner but Yoshida gave Saints hope with a remarkable scissor-kick volley from Shane Long's flick-on.\nSaints, behind again, saved their best chances for the final 10 minutes, substitute Manolo Gabbiadini had two shots inside 60 seconds, but his side were left empty-handed.\nBerahino drought continues\nSaido Berahino started only his second game of the season for Stoke, given the nod up front ahead of Jese as Mark Hughes's side looked to come back from a 4-0 defeat by Chelsea last weekend.\nAnd the 24 year-old striker was afforded the perfect opportunity to net his first goal for the club after being clipped in the box by Van Dijk.\nBut he was denied from the spot by the out-stretched hand of England keeper Forster and he has now gone 30 Premier League games without scoring a goal - he last found the back of the net in February 2016 in West Brom's 3-2 win over Crystal Palace.\nBerahino has not always been shy in front of the goal - the West Brom academy product netted 20 goals in 45 appearances for the club in 2014-15, before his relationship with Albion boss Tony Pulis broke down.\nHaving gone six months without playing, he was finally sold to Stoke City for \u00a312m in January 2017, but has failed to re-find his goal-scoring form.\nHughes seems to be persevering with the talented forward, but his inspired substitution on 70 minutes saw veteran Crouch once again show Berahino how it is done.\n\"It is a shame for Saido Berahino,\" Hughes said after the game. \"I thought he did OK. He showed personality to grab the ball and unfortunately the keeper batted the penalty away.\n\"He will always be judged on goals. He is working hard, he is in good physical condition but his time will come.\"\nMixed return for Virgil van Dijk\nThis was a game in which two players had the opportunity to improve their relationship with both their managers and their fans.\nThe two in question, Berahino and Van Dijk, came together in the 43rd minute as Van Dijk flung a lazy leg at Berahino in the area.\nThe incident was a blow to both of their charm offensives, but aside from the needless penalty, defender Van Dijk was Saints' best player.\nHe had been restored to the Southampton bench in recent weeks but this was his first league start for the club since 22 January.\nThe 26-year-old, who missed the second-half of last season with a knee injury, endured a tumultuous summer on the south coast.\nHis relationship with the club broke down when he handed in a transfer request, was ordered to train alone, his club accused pursuers Liverpool of making an illegal approach and he ended up staying put.\nBut Van Dijk was commanding in defence with a first-minute block on Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, before denying Kurt Zouma's long-range shot and getting a vital deflection on Joe Allen's goal-bound effort.\nMan of the match - Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting (Stoke)\nEric Maxim Choupo-Moting is Stoke's top-scorer this season with two goals - which both came in a 2-2 draw against Manchester United.\nAnd despite not getting on the scoresheet against Southampton, the Cameroon international was heavily involved in all of Stoke's attacks.\nThe home side were pressed back by Saints for much of the game, but Choupo-Moting, who joined from Schalke in the summer, held up the ball up well when required.\nHe clocked up 48 total touches, second only to Joe Allen, before having a hand in the winner.\nHis first effort was blocked by Forster's leg, but he poked a second shot back towards goal and Crouch was on hand to sweep in from two yards.\nEngland recall for Crouch? - the stats\nCrouch is the oldest player to score in the Premier League this season (36 years 243 days old)\nFour of Peter Crouch's last five Premier League goals have come as a substitute\nSaido Berahino is now without a goal in 31 hours & 48 minutes of Premier League football\nAfter scoring each of his first five Premier League penalties, Berahino has failed to score with each of his last three\nSouthampton have suffered their first top-flight away defeat in five games, since losing to Chelsea in April\nSouthampton have given away 10 penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season; a joint-high among current top-flight teams (also 10 for Arsenal and West Ham).\n'Scoring goals is difficult' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino said:\n\"We deserved a little bit more. We controlled the ball and put them under pressure. We were unlucky at the end but we played with character and gave everything.\n\"Scoring goals is the most difficult thing in modern football. I would like to score more. Sometime we have to have more accuracy but we have to keep believing.\n\"To organise the players is a long process but this game is another step.\"\nWhat's next?\nStoke have a tough fixture at home to Manchester City next Saturday (15:00 BST) before Southampton host Newcastle United on Sunday (16:00 BST).\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-1 Manchester City\nManchester City returned to the Premier League summit with an outstanding win at reigning champions Chelsea that was far more convincing than the scoreline suggested.\nKevin de Bruyne's spectacular 67th-minute winner against his former club, a rising left-foot drive from outside the area, gave Pep Guardiola's side a victory their dominance deserved and saw them leapfrog back over arch-rivals Manchester United.\nCity were without striker Sergio Aguero, who sustained rib injuries in a car crash in Amsterdam on Thursday, while Chelsea lost top scorer Alvaro Morata to injury in the first half.\nGuardiola's men coped with Aguero's absence superbly, and threatened to score long before De Bruyne finally broke the deadlock, with Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois making a brilliant reflex save from Fernandinho's header before the break.\nCity never looked in danger once De Bruyne scored and almost added a second when Gabriel Jesus' volley was headed off the line by Antonio Rudiger.\nFollow reaction and relive the action here\nCity show all-round class\nCity have swept aside their past three Premier League opponents in a blaze of spectacular attacking football, scoring 16 goals without reply as Liverpool, Watford and Crystal Palace were thrashed 5-0, 6-0 and 5-0 respectively.\nThe visit to Chelsea was a different challenge making different demands of Pep Guardiola's side - but they proved more than equal to the task.\nChelsea were never going to crumble under the weight of City's attacks, or be overawed by the attacking riches they could offer, even in the absence of leading scorer Aguero.\nCity were going to require patience and perseverance, as well as the reserves of talent at Guardiola's disposal, to get the job done at Stamford Bridge.\nThey provided all those things to end the day back at the Premier League summit, and deliver further evidence Guardiola is on the way to removing the soft underbelly that undermined much of City's first season under his management.\nCity, with John Stones brave and solid as well as classy at the heart of defence, repelled the best a leggy Chelsea could offer and excelled at both ends of the pitch.\nManchester United have proved they are ready to mount a formidable challenge but this was the type of performance that will delight Guardiola and offer proof City are now able to adapt their style to suit all challenges.\nGuardiola's men flourish without Aguero\nThis outstanding result rounded off a troubled week for City, with key defender Benjamin Mendy possibly out for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury, and Aguero sidelined after suffering rib injuries in a car crash in Amsterdam.\nAguero's absence after scoring six goals in six league games this season threatened to be a particularly damaging blow, but this victory against the reigning champions and a side equipped to challenge again this season, demonstrated the strength and quality City possess.\nIn match-winner De Bruyne they have a rare attacking talent, a creator as well as scorer, as he proved with a thunderous finish in the game's decisive moment.\nAnd ahead of him the youthful zest and pace of Jesus and Leroy Sane, along with Raheem Sterling, meant City carried a constant threat throughout even without the world-class Aguero.\nGuardiola wanted City to prove their strength and resilience without Aguero and Mendy. They did it in accomplished fashion.\nDid Chelsea pay for European glory?\nChelsea were second best throughout as City emerged as deserved winners - but perhaps there were mitigating circumstances for the champions.\nAntonio Conte's side not only lost top scorer Morata to a hamstring injury in the first half, they also had 24 hours less preparation time than City after the midweek Champions League action.\nAfter the game, Conte said he thought Morata's injury would not be too serious. \"He stopped before it became a serious injury,\" said Conte. \"He said he'd prefer to stop himself before risking a bad injury.\"\nCity were at home as they beat Shakhtar Donetsk 2-0 on Tuesday, while Chelsea had a physically and mentally draining evening as they beat Atletico Madrid 2-1 in Spain on Wednesday.\n\"We could take this as an excuse,\" said Conte. \"When you have to play another massive game a few days later, it's impossible to press box to box.\"\nChelsea were no match for City here, the scoreline flattering the home side - but it may just be that they paid the price for their exertions during that landmark win against Atletico.\nManager Antonio Conte will certainly hope this is the case because City looked ominously superior during this 90 minutes.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nReaction - Conte not too concerned\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"For sure there is a disappointment for the result but I think when two great teams play these games anything can happen. I'm pleased with the commitment. Today we gave everything. The most important thing is to see your players gave you everything.\n\"We played against a very good team and we created chances but we didn't take them. City took their chance. A great compliment to Manchester City.\n\"We have to try to put everything in every game, we did this today. We have to go game by game, to do our best and then I will see at the end of the season where we finish in the league. When I see that my players give everything, we must be pleased.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola to BBC Sport: \"We are so happy. The most important thing is to win the game but the way we played, especially in the second half, was pleasing.\n\"We had control and in the second half we adjusted our possession and the way we attacked. They could not play and had to do long balls.\"\nMatch stats - De Bruyne loves a long-range goal\nChelsea have dropped eight points in four Premier League home games so far in 2017-18; two more than in the whole of 2016-17.\nManchester City have kept four consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since September 2015 (six games in that run).\nChelsea have failed to score in consecutive home league games for the first time since November 2012.\nChelsea had 38% possession, their second-lowest in a home Premier League game since 2003-04 (lowest is the 29.6% v Man Utd in April 2015).\nPep Guardiola enjoyed his first victory against Chelsea in eight games in all competitions (not including shootout wins), after previously losing three and drawing four.\nKevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in 15 goals in his past 17 Premier League appearances (3 goals, 12 assists).\nNine of De Bruyne's past 11 goals for City in all competitions have come from outside the box, including each of the past four.\nGabriel Jesus has had a hand in 16 goals in his 16 Premier League games, scoring 11 and assisting five.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Chelsea go to Crystal Palace, who have lost all seven games this season without scoring, at 15:00 BST on Saturday, 14 October. Manchester City host Stoke City at the same time."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger celebrated the 21st anniversary of his arrival at the club with a routine victory over Brighton.\nNacho Monreal put the Gunners ahead early on when he shot through a crowded penalty area after Brighton had failed to clear a free-kick.\nA well worked Brighton free-kick resulted in Solly March striking the post from 20 yards shortly afterwards.\nBut Arsenal added a second goal after half-time when a slick passing move on the counter-attack was emphatically finished off by Alex Iwobi.\nThe win ensures Wenger's side are a point behind north London rivals Tottenham in the chasing pack behind Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nMomentum builds under marathon man Wenger\nBrighton became the 45th different club that Wenger has defeated in the Premier League - more than any other manager in the competition's history.\nThere was criticism for Wenger earlier in the season and he remains a divisive figure among Arsenal supporters, but their season now appears to be on an upward trajectory.\nAfter an impressive September, in which the Gunners went unbeaten with five victories and a draw in all competitions, they began the month of October with a dominant victory and performance.\nFor the first time in Wenger's Arsenal tenure he has had to juggle the different challenges posed by the Europa League but the erudite Frenchman appears to have got a handle on the requirements of playing on Thursday and Sunday.\nIndeed, against newly promoted Brighton the Gunners looked something akin to the flat-track bullies of old. While not at their brilliant best, it was a display with the swagger and fluid football which has become Wenger's trademark.\nThis was epitomised by Arsenal's stylish second goal 11 minutes after half-time, which was a thing of beauty; a swift interchange of passes involving Aaron Ramsey, Alexis Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette left Brighton's players in a spin before Iwobi fired home.\nThe acid test for Arsenal will come against their rivals for the top four, but there at least appears to be growing momentum and belief about Wenger's side.\nHughton should trust his promotion players\nThe Brighton players were out on the Emirates turf an hour and a half before kick-off taking pictures, giving the impression they were treating the game like a cup final.\nThe reality when the game kicked off was that Arsenal simply possessed too much quality for the visitors and the margin of victory could easily have been greater.\nBrighton have strengthened their squad for the challenge of Premier League survival with the likes of club record signing Jose Izquierdo, handed his first start against the Gunners.\nBut the Seagulls actually looked more purposeful when Glenn Murray and Anthony Knockaert - two mainstays of their promotion-winning side - came on as second-half substitutes.\nIt shows Brighton boss Chris Hughton can still put his faith in the tried and tested players who delivered for him last season.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\n'Football changed a lot in 21 years' - what they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"In this job you only look for the next game. When you look back you see the distance you have made. Overall, football changed a lot in this 21 years.\n\"We kept the clean sheet and of course got three points. We have played more fluent than today but playing Monday, Thursday and today, it was important to get three points. We eased off in concentration and decision-making and then it becomes a bit harder.\n\"The question mark is there when you change so many players, can you keep cohesion? It was a difficult week because the game at BATE was a difficult game. I am pleased.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"It was a spirited performance. I can't accuse the lads of not giving everything.\n\"It is always going to be difficult here, levels of concentration have to be for 90 minutes.\n\"The only disappointment in the game is that we could have shown a little more on the ball and been a little more adventurous on the ball. You have to look at the positives.\"\nFour successive clean sheets for Arsenal - the stats\nArsenal have won their past 11 games at Emirates Stadium in all competitions, their second longest run at the ground (12 between May and November 2009).\nBrighton have never won an away match against Arsenal in all competitions, drawing once, losing six times and scoring just one goal.\nAlexis Sanchez has had a hand in 35 Premier League goals since the start of last season (24 goals, 11 assists), more than double any other Arsenal player in that time (Mesut Ozil, 17).\nNacho Monreal scored his fourth goal for Arsenal in all competitions, each coming at a different ground.\nThe Gunners have kept four successive Premier League clean sheets for the first time since May 2014.\nBrighton have scored just one goal in their four Premier League away games so far this season.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Arsenal face Watford at Vicarage Road on Saturday, 14 October in the day's late kick-off (17:30 BST), while Brighton return to the home comforts of the Amex on Sunday, 15 October where they host Everton in a lunchtime fixture (13:30 BST).\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

        "article_text": "Everton 0-1 Burnley\nJeff Hendrick finished off a magnificent Burnley team move to beat Everton at Goodison Park as the Clarets' impressive start to the season continued.\nAfter withstanding some early pressure, Sean Dyche's side took the lead against the run of play with a move that included a series of 24 passes.\nEverton's Nikola Vlasic was caught ball-watching as Stephen Ward cut it back into the box for Hendrick, who smartly sidestepped Morgan Schneiderlin's poor attempt at a challenge and placed it into the net from 15 yards.\nIt is Burnley's best ever start to a Premier League season as they move to sixth in the table and have eight away points, more than they accumulated in the whole of last season.\nThe Toffees have lost four of their past five Premier League games and are two places above the relegation zone.\nRelive Burnley's win over Everton as it happened\nEverton struggle after bright start\nEverton made a lively start to the game inside the opening 20 minutes, a contrast to some of their slow and lacklustre performances so far this season, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin's pace causing Burnley early problems.\nOumar Niasse, who scored two goals as a substitute against Bournemouth last week, bent a shot from outside the area straight into the hands of Nick Pope in the Burnley goal.\nThe Senegal striker then attempted a dink over the goalkeeper from close range, with his effort cleared off the line.\nThe Toffees' record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson then missed a chance to put his side in front when his side-footed effort was easily saved by Pope. The Icelandic midfielder, making his 250th league appearance, is yet to register an assist or score in the Premier League for Everton.\nEverton struggled in the second half as they chased the equaliser. Calvert-Lewin and Niasse failed to make any real impact and Sigurdsson's performance was best demonstrated by a long-range shot which was blasted well over the bar.\nWayne Rooney came on as a second-half substitute but could not find a way through Burnley's stubborn defence.\nEverton did have two late penalty shouts, firstly when a Rooney header glanced off the raised hand of Matt Lowton, then when a Williams header seemed to strike Lowton on the chest rather than the hand.\nFormer Everton and Scotland winger Pat Nevin described Everton's performance as \"painful to watch\".\n\"If you are a striker it doesn't matter if you get the ball or not you have to work your socks off. You have to create space for your partner or other players to run into the space you vacate. You have to do horrible miles for others,\" Nevin said on BBC Radio 5 live.\nA Burnley team effort\nVlasic was not the only Everton player at fault for the Burnley goal, with his team-mates offering far too much space, Williams defending too deep and Schneiderlin looking clumsy as he raced in to challenge goalscorer Hendrick.\nBut credit must go to Burnley, who converted their first real chance of the match. The 24 passes in the build-up is the second highest of any goal in the league this season, after the 31 passes before Fabian Delph's strike for Manchester City against Crystal Palace.\nThings could have gone from bad to worse for Everton after some sloppy defending from Williams, with Burnley feeling they should have had a penalty.\nThe Welsh centre-back's clearance from inside his own area was struck straight into a Burnley player, the ball subsequently falling to Scott Arfield.\nWilliams then looked to lunge into Arfield but referee Jon Moss somewhat harshly booked the Canadian midfielder for diving.\nBurnley's only away win last season came on April 29, a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace, as the Clarets picked up seven away points during the campaign.\nAlready this season, they have recorded wins against Chelsea on the opening day and draws at Tottenham and Liverpool.\n\"Some of it is down to organisation and some learning about the Premier League,\" Dyche said.\n\"The mentality of the players and growth of players is a massive thing, to go to stadiums and be more assured.\"\nKoeman's woes continue\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman is under increasing pressure, as boos echoed around Goodison Park at full-time.\n\"I can't complain about the reactions of fans. Everyone is disappointed about the result but I don't think they can be disappointed about the commitment,\" Koeman said.\nThe Dutchman spent heavily in this summer, acquiring the likes of Rooney, Sigurdsson, Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford and Davy Klaassen, as Everton looked to build on the seventh-place finish last season.\nHowever, it is the failure to replace striker Romelu Lukaku, who left for Manchester United, that has left the Toffees short up front.\nThe club have scored four goals in the league this season, with only bottom-placed Crystal Palace and Swansea, 18th in the table, having scored fewer.\nAsked about pressure on him, Koeman said: \"I like the team and my players. The solution starts by the commitment of the players and we need to improve and have a bit of luck.\"\nMan of the match - James Tarkowski (Burnley)\nA day to remember for Burnley, one to forget for Everton - the stats\nEverton have already lost as many league games at Goodison Park this term as they did in the whole of Koeman's first season at the club (two in 2016-17).\nThe Toffees have scored just four goals in the Premier League this term; their fewest after seven games of a league season since 2005-06 (one).\nBurnley, meanwhile, have now picked up eight points away from home in the Premier League this season; one more than they did in the whole of the previous campaign (seven).\nJeff Hendrick's goal featured the most passes in the build-up of any Burnley goal in Premier League history (24).\nThe Irish international ended a run of 27 games in all competitions without scoring for Burnley, netting his first away goal for the club in the process.\nEverton have failed to keep a clean sheet in six consecutive Premier League games; just one short of their previous longest run under Ronald Koeman (seven games in November-December 2016).\nBurnley pair James Tarkowski and Ben Mee have made more blocks between them (30) than 16 of the other 19 Premier League teams this season.\n'We showed the right attitude and commitment' - what they said\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I can't complain about my players. We showed the right attitude and commitment that we need to play with. We had big chances in the beginning then the game would be totally different.\n\"You know when you go down against Burnley it is tough. They drop back and are good defensively, organisationally and physically strong. We needed to be at our best to create and we didn't create a lot.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It was really hard-fought. There was a good mixture today. It was a fantastic goal with a lot of passes - the ball from Robbie Brady was fantastic vision - and then real earthy, nitty-gritty defending.\n\"A lot of things are coming together. Last year the margins were really tight and now we are getting on the right side of those margins.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton face a trip to Brighton after the international break on Sunday, 15 October (13:30 BST), before hosting Arsenal on 22 October (13:30 BST) and then an away fixture to Leicester City on 29 October (16:00 GMT).\nBurnley host West Ham on Saturday, 14 October (15:00 BST), face Manchester City away on 21 October (15:00 BST) and then welcome Newcastle United on 30 October (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-1 Liverpool\nLiverpool endured a familiar frustrating afternoon in front of goal as they were held to a draw at Newcastle.\nManager Jurgen Klopp once again saw his side dominate possession and create chances but once again saw them fail to capitalise as former Reds boss Rafael Benitez guided the hosts to a draw.\nPhilippe Coutinho gave Liverpool the lead with a superb 25-yard curler but more poor defending allowed Joselu to equalise with a fortunate finish before the break.\nLiverpool were dominant in the second half but could not find a way through as Benitez continued his record of never losing against Liverpool during his managerial career.\nKlopp's side have now won one of their last seven games in all competitions and are seventh in the Premier League.\nAnalysis: Liverpool lack urgency - a new problem for Klopp?\nSame old story for Klopp\nFor Liverpool, who have now drawn three of their opening seven games, the recent problems are well documented - they cannot kill teams off.\nIn six games in September, Klopp's side had 126 shots on goal, but only 34 were on target and they only won once in all competitions.\nIt was a similar story at St James' Park, with Mohamed Salah, Georginio Wijnaldum and Daniel Sturridge all wasting clear openings before Coutinho's superb goal.\nPodcast: 'Liverpool a long way off winning title\nA miscued clearance fell at the feet of the Brazilian 30 yards out, he cut between two midfielders before stepping around Jonjo Shelvey and bending a wonderful shot into the top corner.\nBut the lead lasted just seven minutes as the team's soft underbelly was again exposed, Shelvey playing a fine through-ball under no pressure to send Joselu through a huge gap in the Reds defence.\nJoel Matip made a recovery challenge but could only clear the ball into the shins of Joselu and send it past Simon Mignolet.\nWhether Klopp bemoans bad luck or poor defending, the facts are that Manchester City and Manchester United have both conceded just twice in the Premier League all season - Liverpool have now shipped 12, including nine in their last four matches.\nSturridge fails striking audition\nAfter seeing his side yet again miss a host of chances in the 1-1 Champions League draw at Spartak Moscow on Tuesday, Klopp handed Sturridge a rare chance from the start, leaving Roberto Firmino on the bench.\nBut despite some neat touches - one pass to free Salah in particular was outstanding - the England striker did not provide the cutting edge his team currently need so badly.\nIn the end he had one big chance to score in the match and could only hit tamely at Rob Elliot after a miscued clearance fell to him. Salah was equally guilty, scooping the rebound over the top.\nSturridge has scored just 10 Premier League goals in Klopp's two years in charge at the club.\nLiverpool's best chance of a winner came in the final minute when substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain headed over, though Newcastle also had a chance to take all three points in stoppage time when more slack marking from a corner almost allowed Mohamed Diame to score.\nBenitez bringing stability back\nThese two clubs memorably played out back-to-back 4-3 games at Anfield in 1996 and 1997 - and as a result are seemingly broadcast live every season.\nKevin Keegan's Newcastle team of the 1990s may have served up a similar scoreline against this team of Klopp's, but there was little chance of Benitez sharing in such a goalfest.\nHis side were impressive, clinical in taking the one clear chance they created, and never allowed Liverpool to relax despite their stranglehold on possession.\nBenitez will forever be etched into the history of Liverpool after winning the Champions League in 2005 - but he is also loved by Newcastle fans after guiding them back to the Premier League at the first time of asking with the minimum of fuss last season.\nHe could, on the early evidence, achieve survival in a similar manner.\n'They scored their one chance - that doesn't feel too fair'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"I am disappointed, frustrated, whatever you want. We scored a wonderful goal and created wonderful chances. We shot the ball over the goal even when it was empty.\n\"We created five or six outstanding, big chances. Usually we score with one of them. I didn't see one more chance for Newcastle.\n\"They got one chance and scored. That doesn't feel too fair. If you don't help yourself no one else help you.\n\"It will be like this until we score. We play like this it makes sense that we play like this usually we score in situations like this. We have to accept this and carry on.\"\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez:\n\"When you get just one point at home we cannot be happy but against a top-six side like Liverpool, creating so many chances, you have to be a little bit happy. The way our players were working, tackling and trying to win every ball was fantastic.\n\"We have two or three situations when we could be more composed on the ball but we lost these situations. This could make a difference. If we can score then they are under pressure and can make mistakes.\"\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\nLiverpool's long-range record - the stats\nThe Magpies have only lost once at St. James' Park in the Premier League under Rafa Benitez (won five, drew three).\nPhilippe Coutinho has scored 17 goals from outside the box in the Premier League - three more than any other player since his debut in February 2013.\nLiverpool have scored 295 Premier League goals from outside the box, 33 more than any other side.\nJoselu is yet to lose a Premier League game in which he has scored (won five, drew one) and has has scored two goals from three shots on target at St. James' Park in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides have a fortnight's break coming up thanks to international football. Newcastle travel to Southampton on 15 October, while Liverpool have arguably their biggest game of the season when they host Manchester United at lunchtime on the 14th.\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-0 Manchester United\nManchester United keeper David de Gea produced a world-class save to deny Joel Matip as Liverpool were frustrated by Jose Mourinho's stubborn side at Anfield for the second successive season.\nJurgen Klopp's side peppered the United goal with 19 shots but a combination of outstanding goalkeeping by Spain keeper De Gea and the home team's poor finishing denied them a decisive moment.\nThe German's men were in control of the game for long periods but their profligacy in front of goal means they have now won just once in eight games.\nThe most noteworthy incident of an uneventful first half was De Gea denying Cameroon defender Matip from close range with a brilliant reflex save with his outstretched left boot, before Mohamed Salah fired the rebound wide.\nUnited offered very little quality in attack although De Gea's counterpart Simon Mignolet had to smartly parry Romelu Lukaku's fierce attempt before the interval.\nLiverpool dominated even more after half-time but Emre Can wasted their best chance when he volleyed over the bar from eight yards after being picked out by the impressive Joe Gomez.\nThe point leaves United - with nine clean sheets in their past 10 league games - two points behind Manchester City, who thrashed Stoke 7-2.\nLiverpool couldn't use Man Utd tactics - Klopp\nListen: 'Mourinho not looking at this as a one off game'\nReaction from Liverpool and Manchester United's stalemate\nHistory repeats itself\nIt's almost a year to the day Liverpool and United played out a goalless and drab stalemate in the same stadium, with the hosts subdued by a vintage Mourinho masterclass in defensive organisation.\nTwelve months on, this game was only marginally better despite Liverpool taking the match to United with more urgency after the break than they mustered in 2016.\nA year ago, United were grateful for two fine second-half saves from goalkeeper De Gea to deny Can and Philippe Coutinho.\nThis time the Spaniard produced a magnificent save with his foot to keep out Matip from close range on his way to his 18th Premier League clean sheet of 2017.\nThis was only Liverpool's third clean sheet in 13 games this season but Mourinho will have been the happier manager at the final whistle.\nThe visitors had just 38% of possession - a 3% improvement on their last visit - yet their dogged defensive display stopped Liverpool scoring for only the second time this season in the Premier League.\nLukaku fails big test\nLukaku started the day as the Premier League's leading scorer yet, not for the first time, he failed to deliver against Liverpool.\nThe powerful Belgium striker registered a shot on target - something he had not done in five of his past seven meetings against the Reds - when his compatriot Mignolet beat away his stinging first-half shot in front of The Kop.\nBut this was largely a game to forget for the former Everton striker, who lacked the sharpness that had helped him to seven goals in his first seven league games for United.\nLukaku managed just one touch in the opening 23 minutes and his frustration seemed to take over when he clattered into Matip and then his left foot appeared to catch Dejan Lovren - although he escaped a yellow card on both occasion.\nHe ended the match with 22 touches, which was reflective of his own subdued performance as well as the modest attacking ambition shown by his team-mates as United's six-match winning run came to an end.\nMane missed by Reds\nLiverpool have now gone seven matches without beating United in the Premier League and were predictably hampered by the absence of Sadio Mane.\nMane watched on from the stands, nursing the hamstring injury that is likely to keep him out of action until next month.\nWhile Salah was impressive on the right wing - especially in the opening period - the Reds missed the Senegal forward's pace, directness and finishing.\nThe game in general lacked real attacking fluency from either side, with neither managing a single shot on target in the second half.\nIndeed, BBC Radio 5 live summariser Danny Mills labelled a \"typical contest\" after the international break.\n\"If you have seven days to work with your team you can work on creativity, fluidity and attacking intent,\" said the former Manchester City defender.\n\"If you've got two days after an international break then it's simply a case of getting solid as a unit.\n\"You're all weary, you've all been travelling, so you simply need to ensure you get defensively solid.\"\nMan of the match - David de Gea (Manchester United)\n'We don't score easy goals anymore'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"It was a good performance, I thought worthy of three points. We were unlucky in at least two, maybe three situations - of course the big chance when De Gea made the save.\n\"There were a lot of good individual performances. Even when the last few games for us were not perfect, we were clear and concentrated.\n\"I felt the referee should have given us a penalty. Then, maybe, it was a red card with the Lukaku and Lovren situation. Two situations, with different outcomes producing maybe a different result.\n\"We need to be creative and brave in a situation like we are in. We don't score easy goals anymore so the biggest challenge is not to lose confidence and we haven't.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho:\n\"A point, in this long marathon? A point at Anfield is OK.\n\"In the first half we had the ball and were always compact. We had a few shots in the second half.\"\nKlopp bosses Mourinho - the stats\nJose Mourinho has won only one of his eight matches as a manager against Jurgen Klopp in all competitions (W1 D4 L3).\nSince Mourinho took charge of Manchester United last summer, these two clubs have won exactly same number of points in the Premier League (89).\nLiverpool and United have drawn three consecutive league meetings for the first time since 1921.\nUnited have equalled their best points tally after the first eight matches of a Premier League season (20 points), which they achieved in 2011/12 & 1999/00.\nSince Klopp took charge, Liverpool have won the most points in matches between the 'big six' in the Premier League (37 points).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool turn their attentions to the Champions League, with a midweek Group E trip to Slovenia to face Maribor (19:45 BST) on Tuesday.\nUnited are also on their travels for Europe's elite competition as Mourinho returns to Portugal on Wednesday for a Champions League Group A game against Benfica (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 West Ham United\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic was \"disappointed and angry\" with Andy Carroll after the striker was sent off in their draw at Burnley.\nChris Wood's header five minutes from time cancelled out Michail Antonio's opener to rescue a point for Burnley as West Ham played the majority of the contest with 10 men.\nCarroll, 28, was sent off in the 27th minute when he was booked twice in the space of 99 seconds for using his elbow.\n\"I have no complaints with Andy's sending off - he's an experienced player. I'm very disappointed and angry,\" Bilic said.\n\"With the second one you can't do that, especially two minutes after you've been booked. It was an unbelievable bad decision (from Carroll). Losing Andy was a big blow for us.\"\nAntonio put West Ham ahead when he capitalised on Ben Mee's misjudgement of Joe Hart's clearance to touch the ball past Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope and slide it into the empty net.\nBurnley felt they should have had the chance to equalise from the penalty spot after Hammers keeper Hart caught Wood without appearing to make contact with the ball.\nBut West Ham otherwise defended with composure and resilience before Wood levelled late on when he headed home Johann Gudmundsson's cross.\nRelive Burnley's draw with West Ham as it happened\nCareless Carroll costs Hammers\nEngland forward Carroll was sent off for two bookings in quick succession for the same offence of using his elbow.\nThere appeared little intent from Carroll to injure either Mee or James Tarkowski, with his eyes seemingly fixed on the ball.\nBut after receiving the first booking from Stuart Attwell, Bilic's post-match assessment suggests he feels the former Liverpool striker should have shown more composure.\nCarroll was fortunate West Ham responded positively to being reduced to 10 men with a stout defensive display, but his dismissal patently made it more difficult for the Hammers to hold onto the lead given to them by Antonio.\nAnd with mental and physical levels low after playing for so long a man down, former Leeds forward Wood stepped in to deny the visitors three points.\nClarets still lacking goals at home\nTwo goals at home in four matches is a modest return for Burnley at Turf Moor so far this season.\nClarets boss Sean Dyche has maintained he is not concerned how or where his side's points are acquired and given their impressive start to the season, it is harsh to be critical.\nNevertheless their profligacy on home turf is an issue Dyche will surely be eager to resolve sooner rather than later because even against 10 men Burnley struggled to break down an organised West Ham side.\nIt was not until half-time that Dyche deviated from his trusted 4-4-1-1 formation, but even then they were largely restricted to long-range efforts.\nDyche's trademark tactics and selection have served him well at Burnley - witness their comfortable position in the top half of the table - but finding the net with more frequency on their own patch will likely be a priority for him.\nMan of the match - Michail Antonio (West Ham)\n'We could have had a penalty' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"They sort of semi-camped in with 10 men. Generally we had a lot of the ball but it can be difficult to break them down.\n\"A fine bit of quality eventually got us a goal and it was a fine goal. It looked to me we could have had a penalty on Chris Wood too. We didn't get it but you'd hope on another day we do.\n\"I'm very pleased. The way we're going in general is good - I'm certainly not disappointed with that.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"It's a good point for us. Mixed emotions because we were close to three points but it's not easy with 10 men.\n\"Even so we could have scored another in the second half and then we defended well.\n\"I can only praise my players for their effort, quality and performance. When we had 11 v 11 we were much better today; dangerous and attacking.\"\nFirst goalkeeper assist of 2017 - the stats\nBurnley have gone six top-flight games without defeat for the first time since February 1975.\nWest Ham have won only one of their last 12 away games in the Premier League (D5 L6).\nSince Slaven Bilic took over at West Ham, the Hammers have picked up 12 red cards in the Premier League, three more than any other side.\nMichail Antonio netted his first Premier League goal since March, ending a run of nine games without one.\nJoe Hart is the 51st goalkeeper to provide an assist in the Premier League.\nHart registered the first Premier League assist by a goalkeeper since Boxing Day 2016 (Joel Robles - Everton v Leicester).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley face the daunting prospect of a trip to free-scoring Manchester City on Saturday, 21 October (15:00 BST). West Ham are in action on Friday, 20 October when they host Brighton in an evening kick-off (20:00) at the London Stadium."

It was difficult to find the space. We had a lot of time on the ball but could not break down the opponent.\n\"In the second half we found better positions and moved the ball quickly, it was much better. We are always suffering if you don't score the second goal. It was good, not great, but enough to win the three points.\n\"I am delighted we have won but it is impossible to stop you asking me about Wembley.\"\nBournemouth defender Nathan Ake: \"We came with a gameplan and we executed it well. We just lost the game. They only got in once and they scored.\n\"We have more stability with three at the back, we were compact and it worked well.\n\"In the last few games we have been playing better but we have to pick up points. We could have got away with a draw today.\"\nKane equals unwanted Shearer record\nBournemouth directed just one shot on target in the game, something they last managed in a Premier League match last April, against Spurs.\nChristian Eriksen has scored three goals in his past five Premier League games, as many as in his previous 24.\nHarry Kane has failed to score in his first four home Premier League games of the season, despite scoring six goals overall. The only other player to do this was Alan Shearer in '93-94.\nKane has now mustered 28 shots in home league games this season without scoring, with 10 of them on target.\nSpurs have kept four clean sheets in their past five Premier League games after keeping just one in the seven before that.\nThe Cherries have managed just one clean sheet in their past 11 top-flight games.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to the Bernabeu to face European champions Real Madrid on Tuesday, kick-off 19:45 BST, before Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool visit Wembley a week on Sunday (16:00).\nBournemouth, meanwhile, travel to Stoke City in the Premier League for a 15:00 kick-off next Saturday."

That's why I am very pleased. It is the best performance since I came here.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes added: \"They were quicker, stronger and anticipated things far quicker than us, and in the end we had no answers to the questions they posed to us.\"\nCity scored three times in the first period and had 83.5% of the possession in what was arguably the most one-sided Premier League half this season.\nGabriel Jesus was the first to find the net when he nipped in ahead of Mame Biram Diouf to prod home. De Bruyne then threaded a 'no-look' pass into the path of Leroy Sane, who fed Raheem Sterling to slot in.\nIt was 3-0 by the 27th minute when Spain midfielder David Silva fired home after more good work from Sterling and Sane.\nThe only surprise of the first 45 minutes was when Diouf's deflected shot reduced the deficit.\nThe home side then received another jolt when the Senegal player's header came off the leg of Kyle Walker, hit the post and beat Ederson in goal two minutes after the restart.\nAny hopes of a fightback, though, were quashed when Jesus smashed in his second from close range via another beautiful De Bruyne delivery.\nFernandinho then produced the goal of the game with a rocket from 25 yards that whistled past Jack Butland in goal.\nBelgian De Bruyne's magic then allowed Sane to slot in the sixth before substitute Bernardo Silva completed the rout when he converted Sterling's pass.\nRelive the action from the Etihad Stadium\nDe Bruyne dazzles in 100th Man City game\nAnd so the eulogies continue to accumulate for a midfielder who must already be one of the front-runners for the player of the season award.\nDe Bruyne had been playing in a deeper role in recent matches but against Stoke it looked at one stage that the home side were made up of a team De Bruynes - he appeared everywhere.\nHaving been involved in the build-up for the first, the Belgian brought the home support to its feet when his Ronaldinho-esque pass found its way to Sane, who then squared the ball to Sterling for 2-0.\nAnd when City's lead was cut to a goal after the break, De Bruyne eased the jitters with an assist for Jesus who slammed in the fourth.\nThe sublime pass for Sane for 6-2 was even better - slotted through a group of Stoke players to find his man.\nDe Bruyne told BBC Sport: \"We play in a flow at the moment - we are playing well. Not just me.\n\"It looks wonderful to see the goals - it's not an individual action.\n\"I'm very happy because we're winning the games at the moment. I'm going with the level of the team, which is very high at the moment.\"\nWhat they said about De Bruyne:\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"He is one of the best by far, he is someone who produced a lot of actions.\"\nGoalscorer Gabriel Jesus: \"I'm really happy and pleased to be playing with high-level players like him. We all feel lucky to have him in our team.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"His quality throughout was absolutely sensational to be perfectly honest - for me he is the best player in the Premier League by a country mile.\"\nMan City's 'Avengers' wow without Aguero\nJust before the break, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola suggested, inadvertently or otherwise, that title rivals Tottenham were a one-man team because of Harry Kane's goals this season. He has scored 13 of their 22 goals in all competitions this season.\nThe equally invaluable Aguero was City's leading scorer coming into match but on Saturday the league leaders showed they are a team of many superheroes, as the Argentine sat on the bench.\nBoth Sterling and Jesus were dazzling and have now scored seven goals apiece - the same total as the Argentine - while fast-improving Sane, who has played fewer minutes than the trio, has found the net six times.\nTheir goals have helped Manchester City become the first top-flight team to score 29 times in their first eight league games of the season since Everton in 1894-95\nWhich team will be able to slow down this juggernaut?\nMan of the match - Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\n'It was far too easy for Man City' - the reaction\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I have to say, the first half we were way off the levels we needed to be at - we didn't defend good enough and it was far too easy for them.\n\"As a consequence of that we were three goals behind midway through the first half, which when you come to places like this you simply can't allow to happen.\n\"We got a goal back before half-time and we made a couple of changes just to try and stem the flow.\"\nSterling's six appeal - the stats\nManchester City scored seven goals in a Premier League game for only the second time - also 7-0 v Norwich in November 2013.\nThis was the second time Stoke have shipped seven goals in a Premier League game, also conceding seven versus Chelsea in April 2010.\nStoke have lost 16 of their last 17 away top-flight matches against teams who've started that day in top spot.\nStoke scored two goals at the Etihad, more than they managed in their previous nine Premier League trips there.\nSterling has scored six goals in his last six Premier League games, more than in his previous 31 combined (five).\nJesus has been involved in 10 goals in nine Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium (eight goals, two assists).\nSince his Manchester City debut in September 2015, Kevin De Bruyne has provided 32 assists in the Premier League, more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City face Napoli at home in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45 BST) and are at home to Burnley next Saturday (15:00 BST).\nOnce Stoke have licked their wounds they will be at home to Bournemouth, which is also next Saturday (15:00 BST)."

The outcome of this encounter looked bleak on paper for Palace.\nBut the hosts seemed rejuvenated after the international break and were inspired by the return of Zaha, who had been out of action with a knee injury since the opening day of the season.\nThe combination of Zaha and Andros Townsend caused problems throughout, with Townsend sending in the ball for Cabaye for the opener.\nThe Blues dominated possession in the second half with 60% of the ball, but they were unable to convert from the 12 shots they had.\nFabregas' 25-yard strike hit the bar, while substitutes Pedro and Charly Musonda could not beat Julian Speroni - the 38-year-old keeper brought in to replace the injured Wayne Hennessey.\nWhat went wrong for Chelsea?\nThe Blues looked pedestrian at times and seemed as off-colour as they had done in their 1-0 defeat by Manchester City before the international break.\nThe champions were without influential midfielder N'Golo Kante and striker Alvaro Morata, and also lost Victor Moses to a suspected hamstring injury in the first half.\nBut the front three of Michy Batshuayi, Willian and Eden Hazard failed to produce the goods, and although substitutes Pedro, Musonda and Davide Zappacosta piled on the pressure during a decent 15 minute spell in the second half, they could not find the goal they craved.\n\"We played this game without three important players and that's not straightforward,\" said Chelsea boss Antonio Conte. \"We started very badly and it was a very difficult day. But we need also to understand the situation and to continue to work, to find solutions despite our injuries.\n\"They are big losses for us but we can only accept the situation and then do our best.

Red wine isn't the best thing to drink if you want to keep your calories low, but I'll enjoy a glass tonight because I enjoyed watching my boys play well and I'm proud of their performance.\"\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\nHodgson matches Allardyce's achievements - the stats\nRoy Hodgson is one of two managers to win against Chelsea with four different Premier League clubs (Blackburn, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, West Brom) - the other being Sam Allardyce, who also managed England.\nPalace's 11th-minute goal meant that they ended a run of 640 minutes without scoring from the start of the season. In Football League history, only Halifax Town in the fourth tier in 1990-91 (730 minutes) had a longer wait to score.\nChelsea have lost consecutive Premier League games under Antonio Conte for just the second time.\nThis is just the sixth time that the team starting the day bottom of the Premier League have beaten the reigning Champions.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea are in Champions League action against Roma on Wednesday (19:45 BST) and welcome Watford in the Premier League next Saturday (12:30 BST).\nCrystal Palace travel to Newcastle on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 2-0 Huddersfield Town\nSwansea City earned their first home win of the Premier League season to lift the pressure on manager Paul Clement.\nTwo goals either side of half-time from Chelsea loanee Tammy Abraham proved decisive as Huddersfield paid the price for making mistakes at both ends and have now gone seven games without victory.\nWith the tension rising at the Liberty Stadium, the Terriers gifted Swansea the lead on 41 minutes when Jonas Lossl passed straight to Tom Carroll, who had time and space to pick out Abraham to slot home his first.\nThe first goal came with David Wagner's side on top. And the visitors were dominating again shortly after the break but could only look on as Jordan Ayew was able to dink the ball over Lossl, with Abraham on hand to poke home.\nRelive Swansea's first home win of the season\nLive Premier League reaction\nSwansea finally find some width\nGoing into Saturday's game Swansea had attempted the fewest shots in the Premier League this season (46) and registered just 30 shots in open play, a league low. The Swans had also fired in just 11 shots on target so far this term.\nClement explained at his pre-match briefing that he was seeking to inject more width into his side and his selection reflected that, with Luciano Narsingh selected for a first Premier League start and only his third appearance this season.\nAnd the Swans began against Huddersfield on the front foot and could have led inside 10 minutes after Carroll's cushioned pass found Abraham, but his firm right-footed effort was tipped behind by Lossl.\nThe goalkeeper could do nothing from the resultant corner when the ball fell to Ayew, but the forward shanked his left-footed effort wide.\nHowever, the Swans were second best as the half wore on and they could have trailed before Abraham struck after Lossl's error.\nWorry setting in for the Terriers?\nWith Premier League survival the undoubted aim for the campaign, it is possible an element of doubt is beginning to creep in to David Wagner's side.\nAnd on Saturday the Terriers only had themselves to blame after missing several key chances with the score level at 0-0.\nElias Kachunga forced Lukasz Fabianski to save midway through the first half before two key opportunities were spurned.\nOn 26 minutes Tom Ince missed a sitter from less than six yards, scooping the ball over after a fine run and cross from Rajiv van La Parra. It was to be the key moment in the match.\nInce then appeared to race clear after Lossl's long punt, but referee Paul Tierney waved away his protests after he went down in a tangle with Martin Olsson. Whether it was a foul was debatable, but the tussle certainly happened outside of the penalty box.\nBy the time Huddersfield had another attack of note they were desperately chasing the contest at 2-0 down and Swansea might have even added gloss to the finish, with substitute Ki Sung-yueng a whisker wide with a shot across goal on 80 minutes.\nVan la Parra did hit the crossbar with a deflected effort, but Fabianski was largely unused as the Swans held firm.\nMan of the match - Tom Carroll\nWhat they said\nSwans boss Paul Clement speaking to BBC Sport: \"Our fans have been frustrated with us, but today they were fantastic and they had something to cheer about from the first whistle.\n\"We were rewarded for our consistency and determination and pressure. We forced the situation and the goal came at a good time, as did the second one. We found a balance between defending well and getting forward.\n\"That was the best game Tammy has played, I was pleased with his overall performance. He was threatening the defence with his runs, his play with his back to goal was better and he put in a good shift defensively.\n\"It was very important we won at home, played well, showed we can attack and have offensive threats. I am delighted with that and it came from good work on the training field.\"\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"The time of the goals wasn't the best. I was frustrated by the performance in the first half in terms of our bravery. I was happier with second half. We were braver and more confident on the ball.\n\"There were so many unlucky situations that went against us. This isn't good, we have to change [our scoring record].\"\nStats - Terriers' goal drought\nSwansea have enjoyed consecutive league wins over Huddersfield for the first time since August 1993, after drawing one and losing five of the previous six.\nHuddersfield have failed to score in four consecutive games in all competitions for the first time since August 2004.\nTammy Abraham scored as many goals against Huddersfield (two) as he had in his previous nine league games.\nTom Carroll registered his first Premier League assist in 19 games, since March (v Burnley).\nSince his debut for Swansea in February, Jordan Ayew has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other current Swans player (two goals, four assists).\nThe Terriers are without a win in six league games (drawn three, lost three) for the first time since November 2015.\nSwansea enjoyed their first Premier League win in five games, and have scored exactly two goals in each of their past four victories.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea welcome Leicester to the Liberty Stadium next Saturday, while Huddersfield host second-placed Manchester United."

        "article_text": "Watford 2-1 Arsenal\nArsene Wenger bemoaned a \"scandalous decision\" to award Watford a penalty as Arsenal squandered a lead to lose 2-1 in injury time at Vicarage Road.\nThe Gunners led through Per Mertesacker's header but the Hornets equalised when Troy Deeney converted from the spot after Hector Bellerin was adjudged to have fouled Richarlison.\nSubstitute Deeney's strike with 19 minutes left set the scene for a stirring Watford finish, with Tom Cleverley converting in the closing seconds to send Watford fourth.\n\"I would say it was not a penalty,\" said Arsenal manager Wenger. \"It came at a moment in the game where it was absolutely important for Watford. No penalty, no goal.\"\nDeeney gave a scathing assessment of Wenger's comments and the Gunners in general, telling BT Sport: \"I've heard Wenger's already saying the penalty is the reason they lost. Well, I'm not going to be one to tell Mr Wenger about himself, but there's a reason they lost and it wasn't because of one penalty.\n\"It's having a bit of cojones. Whenever I play against Arsenal, I'll go up and think 'let me whack the first one and see who wants it'.\n\"I came on today and jumped up with Mertesacker - I didn't even have to jump, actually. I nodded it down, the crowd got up - 'yeah we've got somebody who can win it' - and they all just backed off.\n\"For me as a player, I just think 'happy days'. That's my strength - if you're going to let me do my strength against you, you're going to have a tough afternoon.\"\nHornets boss Marco Silva was unhappy with any inference that attacker Richarlison had exaggerated to win the spot-kick that helped turn the game in his side's favour.\n\"I have seen the penalty and I respect the decision of the referee,\" he said. \"I didn't see a dive or a simulation.\n\"Richarlison has suffered the most fouls in the Premier League this season, and people are starting to say he dives.\n\"He is not. He is fair, He wins fouls like the best players in the world win fouls.\"\nSilva's side have now scored in the 90th minute or beyond in three consecutive games, as a second-half revival sealed their first home win of an impressive start to the campaign.\nWithout the rested Alexis Sanchez the Gunners lacked the cutting edge to capitalise on a string of chances, with substitute Mesut Ozil - short on fitness and also benched - guilty of one glaring miss.\nHome comfort return for ambitious Silva\nWhen Silva arrived at Vicarage Road his record in home games was a key strength.\nThe Portuguese had won many admirers with the way he almost saved Hull City from relegation last season.\nBut seven games into his Premier League tenure at Watford, it was on the road where his resilient side were making their mark.\nAll of their wins had come away from Hertfordshire until Saturday, but the optimistic Portuguese may have sensed his luck could change against an Arsenal side without talisman Sanchez and struggling away from Emirates Stadium.\nWhen your side keeps playing for you until the last, you can even afford to be bullish about a zonal marking system that at one point seemed to cause more harm than good. Arsenal threatened from every set-piece as 5ft 9in Cleverley appeared to be marking 6ft 6in Mertesacker.\nIt let the visitors open the scoring and remained a problem, but afterwards Silva stood by his methods.\n\"It's not wrong,\" he said. \"It's my decision and we will continue this way. We need to do more but we are strong zonally.\"\nAfter taking Watford into the Champions League places on a fraction of the budgets elsewhere in the top four, few can argue.\nFlaky Gunners still lack nerve\nWhile Wenger complained about the penalty, Arsenal fans might be more concerned with the evidence that their side remain so defensively vulnerable.\nGranted they had to ask injury-troubled elder statesman Mertesacker to replace his sidelined compatriot Shkodran Mustafi, but that was not solely to blame.\nFor 45 minutes at least the 33-year-old German was commanding on his first top-flight start since April 2016.\nBut worryingly for Arsenal in this contest, they faced only three shots on target and conceded twice.\nThe panic was palpable in their re-jigged back-line as Watford cranked up that trademark late pressure.\nWenger had readied Jack Wilshire from the bench but brought on another defender, Rob Holding, to cling onto a point. It wasn't enough.\nNot for the first time his defence switched off under pressure, leaving Cleverley unmarked to smash in the late heart-breaker.\nInjuries can't be helped. Organisation and remaining calm under pressure are another thing.\nMan of the match - Heurelho Gomes (Watford)\n'The goal remains to stay up' - what they said\nWatford manager Marco Silva: \"I don't change what I said at the start of the season.\n\"We have one goal, to remain as a Premier League club. It's too early to change.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"I think our level dropped in the second half and we missed many chances to kill the game.\n\"After that, at 1-1, there was no need to panic. I believe that on the second goal we can only look at ourselves.\"\nWatford's best ever start - the stats\nWatford have made their best-ever start to a top-flight season after eight games (15 pts), since their maiden season in the top division in 1982/83 under Graham Taylor (16 pts).\nArsenal lost to a 90+ minute winner in the Premier League for the first time since January 2012 (Bobby Zamora for Fulham).\nArsenal scored with the first shot on target of the game.\nPer Mertesacker scored his first Premier League goal in 1400 days, since netting v Man City in December 2013.\nCourtesy of his penalty kick, Troy Deeney ended his longest-ever goal drought in the Premier League (13 games).\nPetr Cech has failed to save any of the last 18 penalties he has faced in the Premier League, last saving one for Chelsea against Fulham in February 2011.\nDeeney's goal was the first Arsenal conceded in the top-flight in 444 minutes of action.\nWhat's next?\nWatford's remarkable run faces one of its biggest challenges yet, as they head to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea next Saturday (12:30 BST).\nArsenal are in Europa League action on Thursday, when they travel to Serbia to face Red Star Belgrade (18:00 BST)."

We at least deserved one point.\"\nBrighton looked set to secure their third successive home league win when Anthony Knockaert slotted home in the 82nd minute after Jose Izquierdo's shot was blocked by Michael Keane.\nBut, with the clock ticking down, Seagulls defender Bruno elbowed Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the area as a free-kick was floated in.\nRooney sent Ryan the wrong way with his spot-kick, but the Australian rescued his side when he twice saved from substitute Kevin Mirallas in the closing seconds.\nKoeman praised Rooney for keeping his composure.\nHe said: \"Taking penalties is not the most difficult job but, at that moment, if your team needs points and you keep calm then that is experience and that is world-class.\"\nFootball Daily podcast: 'Another frustrating afternoon for Koeman'\nLacklustre Everton frustrate again\nWere it not for Bruno's late indiscretion, it is likely Everton would have fallen to their fifth league defeat of the season.\nBar an effort from Nikola Vlasic and a firm angled strike by Mason Holgate, they did little to cause panic in Brighton's organised and lusty backline, once again led admirably by Lewis Dunk.\nThe visitors did come close to snatching all three points in the final seconds, but that would have been akin to paint covering damp.\nRooney was largely impotent up front and \u00a345m signing Gylfi Sigurdsson once again looked off-key - he had one effort on goal, a 20-yard free-kick which, uncharacteristically, flew very wide.\nDespite their summer outlay, Everton have scored only seven goals in their past 13 league matches under Koeman, and more pertinently have only won twice.\nThe Toffees, who move up one place to 16th, next host Arsenal in the league.\nLISTEN: 'Koeman, for me, has lost the dressing room' - Everton fan on 606\nBrighton grow in confidence\nBrighton were hosting an Everton side lacking in confidence, but nevertheless one expected to beat them.\nSo it says much about the Seagulls that they will be disappointed not to have won.\nAnd had it not been for the heroics of Keane, they might have achieved that feat. The ex-Burnley player made an outstanding block to deny Dunk in the first half, and threw himself in front of a Knockaert drive moments before Brighton scored.\nLike their opponents, Chris Hughton's side also have eight points from eight games, but they are 14th - above the Toffees and West Ham on goal difference.\nMan of the match - Anthony Knockaert (Brighton)\n'We deserved at least point' - the reaction\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"To concede so late, it's even more disappointing. We were the side more likely to score and that we did. I just felt in general play, even with their quality, they wouldn't carve us open.\n\"If you don't put chances away then what happened can happen. We learned that the first game of the season and that was again the case.\n\"In credit to Bruno, he has had a lot of aerial duels in that second half and generally used his body well. He looked at another opportunity to impede him a little bit, but the referee was right there.\n\"Generally because there was a little bit of pushing, the referee was on his case more than he may have been.\n\"We have been in every game and are going to have to play at a certain level - if you play below that you'll get beat. For large parts of the season we have been.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"Of course, in this situation that the team is, you need a little bit of luck.\n\"The first 30 minutes we dominated and the second half, more difficult. It was really difficult to bring them down and they got the goal.\n\"I'm proud of the players for what we showed after that. We had the belief to get at least one point, and maybe we deserved another two.\n\"The first goal was defensively sloppy. You need to stay on your feet. You can't go down easily.\n\"We lost a little bit of control after one or two mistakes in our ball possession. One way to come out of this difficult situation is working hard. To show the belief and commitment of the players.\"\nEverton leak late again - the stats\nRooney has scored against 36 of the 39 different clubs he's faced in the Premier League - only Frank Lampard (39), Andrew Cole (38) and Alan Shearer (37) have scored against more in the competition (Jermain Defoe is also on 36).\nThe only sides Rooney has failed to find the net against are Manchester United (five games), Derby County and Blackpool (two each).\nEverton are winless in their past 12 away Premier League games - their longest such run since a run of 13 ending in March 2002.\nPascal Gross has been directly involved in 83% of Brighton's six Premier League goals this season (two goals, three assists); the highest ratio in the division.\nBrighton have scored the highest percentage of goals in the second half of games in the Premier League this season (83%).\nSix of the past nine goals Everton have conceded away from home in the Premier League have come in the final 10 minutes of games.\nWhat's next?\nEverton are at home to Lyon in the Europa League on Thursday (20:05 BST), then host Arsenal next Sunday (13:30 BST).

He looked dejected on the sideline. It felt like a tough moment.\"\nThe crowd grew more restless throughout as passes were misplaced, crosses failed to find a team-mate - West Ham attempted 33 - and shots went high and wide.\nThe marking for Murray's opening goal from 10 yards was non-existent, while Hart will be questioned for palming Izquierdo's strike into the net as he dived to his left.\n\"He has got that much of his hand on the ball that he has got to save it,\" said Jenas.\nWe've been here before - Bilic\nBilic, who was appointed West Ham manager in June 2015, apologised to fans and said they \"deserve better\".\nAfter steering the club to seventh in the Premier League in his first campaign in charge, West Ham struggled to adapt to their new stadium the following season.\nThey won only two of the first seven league home games after moving from Upton Park - they lost 4-2 to Watford, 3-0 to Southampton and 5-1 to Arsenal - but recovered to finish 11th.\n\"We've been here before and we managed to turn it around,\" said 49-year-old Bilic.\n\"I'm not worried - worried is a bad word. I am strong and all that and on the other hand it's not a question for me about my future.\n\"I know what I feel. I can't say everything publicly. I've tried my best but when you lose 3-0 at home to Brighton I wouldn't be surprised with anything.\"\nChairman Sullivan said he \"believed in what's right\" but did add that a change of manager \"can give you two or three more points\" in a season.\n\"The manager has a three-year contract and is entitled to these three years,\" he said.\n\"After the season we will sit down and see if he wants to stay on and if we want him to stay on.

        "article_text": "Chelsea 4-2 Watford\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte said his side showed they have the \"attitude to fight\" as they scored two late goals to come from behind and claim a dramatic victory against Watford at Stamford Bridge.\nCesar Azpilicueta headed the Blues 3-2 in front in the 87th minute before Michy Batshuayi sealed the victory in stoppage time, ending a three-game winless run despite an unconvincing performance from the champions.\nIt was Batshuayi's second of the game after he had headed an equaliser midway through the second half, his side having fallen behind to Watford goals either side of half-time to hint at a third consecutive Premier League defeat for the Blues.\nPedro put the home side ahead in the 12th minute with a sensational 25-yard strike that curled away from Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes and in off the right-hand post.\nBut the Blues were shaky defensively throughout and Marco Silva's Hornets scored twice through Abdoulaye Doucoure and Roberto Pereyra to put them on course for a famous victory.\nIt could have been even worse for Antonio Conte's side as Brazilian Richarlison missed two glorious chances for Watford - one from six yards out, the other a close-range header - either side of Pereyra's goal.\nBut Batshuayi's equaliser and the third for Azpilicueta saw Conte throw himself into the home crowd as his side completed a turnaround that the Belgium striker then capped deep into injury time.\nChelsea have not lost three consecutive games since 2015 under Jose Mourinho, a month before he was sacked.\nAsked how he felt when his side were 2-1 behind, Conte said: \"I feel a lot of pressure but not this pressure if the club decide to sack me. I will never be worried [about getting the sack], never. I don't worry about this pressure because this is the job.\"\nVictory takes Chelsea above Watford into fourth in the table.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge\nChelsea fans' reaction to Pedro's stunner\nPressure relieved on Conte in thriller\nAfter a relentless run to Premier League glory last season, Chelsea's early defence of the title has been anything but smooth, with defeats to Manchester City and Crystal Palace in their last two games.\nReports this week suggested Chelsea's players were unhappy with Conte's punishing training regime following their Champions League draw with Roma and modest league form.\nThe Blues looked to be settled by Pedro's spectacular opener but as Watford grew into the game the Chelsea defence, so impressive last season, began to look porous.\nThey failed to deal with a long throw for Doucoure's equaliser and Pereyra was then left unmarked for Watford's second as the Hornets cut them open with worrying ease.\nYet credit must go to Chelsea for the way they responded to going behind.\nBatshuayi scored his first 10 minutes after coming on as a substitute to make it 2-2 and the mood at Stamford Bridge changed markedly when Azpilicueta completed the turn around.\nOn the back of their two league defeats and Champions League draw with Roma, it was a win that felt extremely significant for Conte and his side in terms of the whole season.\n\"It is not simple because we are facing difficult situations but the spirit and commitment is right. I'm satisfied for the performance,\" Conte said.\nCertainly their spirit and drive was in marked contrast to the sort of surrender witnessed in the season - that saw Mourinho sacked - that followed their last title triumph.\nMissed chances cost Watford\nWatford started the game unbeaten away from home in the Premier League this season and fourth in the table, one place above Chelsea.\nTheir performance was deeply impressive for the most part, combining athleticism and energy with plenty of technical ability.\nThe marking for Batshuayi and Azpilicueta's headers for Chelsea's second and third goals was poor but what cost them equally as dearly was the finishing of Richarlison.\nFirst, the Brazilian missed an open goal from six yards after Kiko Femen\u00eda's superb cross and then he headed horribly wide from a similar distance when unmarked.\nManager Silva labelled the result \"unfair\" and complimented Richarlison despite his profligacy - but the Portuguese will know that had the forward been less wasteful in front of goal, his side would have given Chelsea an even bigger hill to climb.\n\"It [the result] didn't reflect the match and what we saw on the pitch,\" Silva said. \"Our team came here and controlled most of the match.\"\n\"I'm proud of how we played, but of course I'm really frustrated. It showed our way and we need to continue in this way.\"\nDid Silva move cost Hornets?\nBBC Sport pundit Phil Neville on Match of the Day: \"The game changed I think because of a substitution. Watford dominated the game and they were creating chances. Silva brought Deeney off and put Ben Watson on, an extra midfielder.\n\"All of a sudden the mentality changed. They sat back and allowed Chelsea to get control of the game.\"\n'We showed we have fight' - what they said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte, speaking to Sky Sports: \"The performance was good because to concede the equaliser at the end of the first and then go down in first part of the second half, our confidence in that moment was low.\n\"But my players showed me we have the attitude to fight and change the situation and get a different result. It was very important.\"\nWatford manager Marco Silva, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It is a really unfair result. We didn't create many chances in the first half, it is true, but we controlled the game and Chelsea started to play on the counter attack.\n\"We played our game and in the second half for 40 minutes there was only one team playing on the pitch. After 2-1 we had clear chances to finish the match.\nMan of the match - Michy Batshuayi\nPedro is Chelsea's star - the best stats\nChelsea are unbeaten in their last 13 meetings with Watford in all competitions, winning 10 and drawing three.\nWatford have conceded exactly four goals on each of their last three top-flight trips to London (0-4 v Tottenham, 3-4 v Chelsea and 2-4 v Chelsea today).\nPedro has been directly involved in more goals for Chelsea in all competitions in 2017 than any other player (21 - 12 goals, nine assists).\nEden Hazard registered his first Premier League assist in 15 appearances in the competition (since April 2017 v Crystal Palace).\nAbdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 has scored with all four of his shots on target in the Premier League this season.\nRicharlison (five) has had a hand in more goals than any other Watford player in the Premier League this season (three goals, two assists).\nMichy Batshuayi has scored in each of his three Premier League appearances against Watford (four goals in total).\nSince the start of last season, only Olivier Giroud (seven) has scored more goals as a substitute in the Premier League than Batshuayi (five)\nCesar Azpilicueta has been directly involved in more PL goals than any other defender this season (five - one goal, four assists).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea are in EFL Cup action on Wednesday when they host Everton at Stamford Bridge (19:45 BST) in the fourth round.

The Frenchman was quick to apologise for a poor tackle, and referee Stuart Attwell opted for a yellow card.\nUltimately, Palace failed to record an effort on target and an inability to capitalise while they were on top cost Hodgson's outfit, who are four points adrift at the bottom of the table.\nMan of the match - Andros Townsend (Crystal Palace)\n'We are in a good position' - Benitez\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez: \"It is important to get three points in a difficult game.

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 2-1 Manchester United\nHuddersfield Town beat Manchester United for the first time in 65 years to end their unbeaten start to the season and drop Jose Mourinho's side five points behind league leaders Manchester City at the John Smith's Stadium.\nUnited had only conceded twice in their eight league games this season, but that tally was doubled in five first-half minutes following two sloppy mistakes that were clinically punished.\nJuan Mata gave the ball away to Aaron Mooy in midfield and after he fed Tom Ince, whose shot was saved by David de Gea, the Australian was first to the rebound to sweep home from 10 yards.\nThen Swedish defender Victor Lindelof - on as a substitute for the injured Phil Jones and making just his second Premier League appearance - misjudged a goal kick by Jonas Lossl and Laurent Depoitre raced onto the loose ball to round De Gea and double the Terriers' lead.\nMourinho made a double substitution at half-time, bringing on Marcus Rashford and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, and the former gave United hope with 12 minutes remaining when he nodded in a terrific cross from the otherwise quiet Romelu Lukaku.\nBut despite a nervy finale and with United enjoying almost 80% of possession, the Terriers clung on to record their first league win against United since 1952 and end a run of six league games without a victory.\nWith City beating Burnley 3-0, second-placed United lost ground on their neighbours and title rivals.\nSaturday's 10 best Premier League stats\nRelive Huddersfield's first league win against United in more than 60 years\nUnited's defence breached\nUnited went into the game with seven clean sheets from their eight league games, with only two goals conceded.\nNo side in top-flight history had ever kept eight clean sheets in their first nine games of a season, but their attempt to make history was dealt an early blow when Jones injured his left leg after a tackle with Mooy.\nThe England centre-back slammed the ground in frustration as he knew his afternoon was over and he duly hobbled off on 23 minutes.\nIt meant United were now without both first-choice centre-backs given Eric Bailly is also on the sidelines, and Jones' replacement Lindelof did not cover himself in glory.\nDespite starting all three Champions League games this season, the Swede's only previous Premier League experience had come in the final few minutes against Liverpool in last week's 0-0 draw.\nUnited suddenly looked nervy with the \u00a331m summer signing alongside Chris Smalling in the heart of the defence, something Lindelof demonstrated with his misjudgement of a routine long ball for Huddersfield's second.\nUnited lacked intensity all over the pitch in fact, and Mourinho attempted to change that in the second-half by altering his formation, with Ander Herrera moving to the right of a back three and Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia used as wing-backs.\nUnited did improve, but even so they still managed just three shots on target in the whole match, while Lukaku had a mere two touches in the Huddersfield penalty area.\nTerriers' desire proves the key\nMourinho said afterwards the \"team that wanted it more won\", praising the Terriers' \"emotion, aggression, intensity and desire\".\nThe contrast between the two teams in terms of those qualities was notable, and David Wagner's team did not resemble the side that conceded four goals against Tottenham in their last home game.\nHuddersfield were well organised throughout and enjoyed success in pressing United in the first-half, forcing two errors that they punished clinically.\nTheir energy and discipline limited United to just one shot on target in the first-half, an effort from Lukaku in the sixth minute.\nAnd while United drove at them more in the second-half, the Terriers excelled in defence, with Rashford's goal the only blip in an otherwise sound defensive performance.\nA sliding block by centre-back Mathias Jorgensen to stop Chris Smalling's shot in the 94th minute epitomised their spirit and application.\n\"Can't quite believe it,\" said the stadium announcer at half-time with the score 2-0, in what was a reminder of the club's long wait to get back to the top flight - and why sitting 10th in the league is a significant achievement for Wagner and his side.\nMan of the match - Aaron Mooy\nWhat they said?\nJose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"The best team won. It's simple. I have to give them credit. They had a different attitude, motivation and desire than we had.\n\"Everyone at the stadium could feel in the first couple of minutes that one team was ready to give everything and the other was not ready for it. Maybe only my players realised at half-time.\n\"It's a shock and I am surprised. I have to analyse. I have some ideas, but this is not the moment for that. We say congratulations to the winners because they wanted it more than us.\"\nDavid Wagner told BBC Sport: \"The players have shown everything that you have to show when you play Manchester United - the right spirit, attitude and togetherness.\nI said before I can't expect a result, but I hope and believe in one. We scored at the right moment. We were at our best, even if we did change the gameplan and gave them more of the ball.\n\"The first hour was nearly perfect for us. How we defended, how we kept them away from our goal. The longer it went on, they put more pressure on us.\n\"We had bodies behind the ball, everyone fought to keep it out of the net. It's not only beating Manchester United, which is big enough, but also 12 points on the table.\"\nStats - Mourinho is not a comeback king\nMourinho has failed to win all 19 Premier League games in which his side have been two goals behind (drawn one, lost 18) - that draw coming against Newcastle in September 2015 when managing Chelsea.\nThis was only Mourinho's third defeat to a newly-promoted side in the Premier League (won 33, drawn four) - losing against Crystal Palace in 2013-14, and Bournemouth in 2015-16 when at Chelsea.\nThree of the last six clubs in their debut Premier League season have beaten Manchester United at home - Burnley in 2009-10, Bournemouth in 2015-16 and Huddersfield in 2017-18.\nOnly Wayne Rooney (15) has scored more Premier League goals as a teenager for United than Marcus Rashford (13).\nLukaku has either scored or assisted in eight of his last 10 Premier League games (eight goals, two assists).\nLukaku has however failed to score in 18 of his last 25 Premier League games against newly-promoted teams.\nMooy has had a hand in 10 league goals for Huddersfield in 2017 (four goals, six assists - including the play-offs); four more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nUnited travel to Swansea for a League Cup tie on Tuesday, before hosting Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday.\nHuddersfield are at Liverpool in the league on Saturday."

We are happy that we will have that moment with him.\"\nSaturday's 10 best Premier League stats\nRelive how Man City beat Burnley\nBurnley unhappy with penalty decision\nCity were eventually able to celebrate another victory, but they had to work hard to see off a resolute Clarets side, who were unhappy with the decision that led to them going behind.\nA pack of Burnley players protested when Roger East pointed to the spot after visiting keeper Nick Pope tangled with Bernardo Silva as he chased the loose ball after denying Kevin de Bruyne.\nReplays showed Pope's knee came down on Silva's foot as he slid in, and Guardiola said he thought a penalty was the correct decision.\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said: \"There is contact - I did not know it at the time - but it is minimal.\n\"For him to get that high off the floor with his arms above his head is almost a skill in itself. I was quite impressed with how far he travelled.\n\"If I kicked my kid in the garden, I don't think he would fall like that, so it was a moment where there has to be a bit of honour within the game where you go 'OK, he has caught me, but it is not enough'.\"\nAguero stepped up to calmly slot home, but Burnley, who arrived at the Etihad on the back of a six-game unbeaten run, did not lie down and their determined approach limited further City chances.\nDyche's side had few sights of goal themselves, but it took two goals in the space of two second-half minutes from Nicolas Otamendi and Leroy Sane for the home side to make sure of the points.\nOtamendi rose highest from Sane's corner to power a header into the corner, despite the presence of Steven Defour on the post.\nSane galloped on to a precise through ball from Kevin de Bruyne to score City's third goal, their 20th in their past four home Premier League games.\nCity, two points clear before the game, extended their lead over second-placed Manchester United, who lost 2-1 at Huddersfield Town.\nAguero back, and back in the goals\nIt is only 23 days since Aguero injured his ribs in a car crash in an Amsterdam taxi, but he made a very happy return to action to make his 262nd appearance for City.\nThe 29-year-old Argentina striker, who joined the club for \u00a338m in 2011, was an unused substitute in City's previous two games but was recalled by Pep Guardiola and took his chance.\nAguero missed from the spot when he had the chance to equal Brook's record in his last game, against Shakhtar Donetsk at the end of September, but he made no mistake this time.\nHe went close to breaking Brook's record too, going close with a fierce shot across goal following a run to the edge of the area, and bringing a fine save from Pope.\nBurnley away run ends, but not without a fight\nBurnley arrived at the Etihad on the back of an impressive run of away form that had seen them beat Chelsea and Everton and draw with Liverpool and Tottenham.\nThey approached this game in the same way, by defending with determination and working hard to deny City space and chances.\nThe Clarets succeeded in making life difficult for their hosts, although Pope had to make good saves from De Bruyne, David Silva and Aguero, while James Tarkowski made a typically brave block with his head to stop Bernardo Silva from scoring.\nDyche's side had less success at the other end, although Chris Wood forced Ederson to come rushing from his goal when he battled through and Scott Arfield should have done better when the ball broke to him on the edge of the box.\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane\nSane shining - the stats\nThis is Manchester City's joint-best points return after nine games of a Premier League season, alongside 2011-12. The only team who have more more points at this stage of a season were Chelsea (27) in 2005-06.\nCity have 25 points this season; only once has Pep Guardiola (27 with Bayern Munich in 2015-16) won more points as a manager from the opening nine games of the season.\nCity's Leroy Sane has both scored and assisted in three of his past four Premier League games.\nSane has been involved in nine goals in his past six Premier League games (five goals, four assists).\nSince his City debut in September 2015, Kevin de Bruyne has provided 33 assists in the Premier League, more than any other player.\nWhat next?\nManchester City host Wolves in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (20:00 BST), then travel to play West Brom next Saturday (15:00).\nBurnley are next in action on Monday, 30 October, when they are at home to Newcastle (20:00)."

We've got to go again. There's no point feeling sorry for ourselves.\"\nRelive Bournemouth's away victory at Stoke\nBournemouth avoid unwanted record\nDefeat at Stoke would have equalled Bournemouth's worst start to a league campaign after one win from their first eight games, during which they had scored only four goals.\nThey were dealt a blow when forwards Joshua King and Jermain Defoe, scorers of two of those four goals in that time, were ruled out by illness and injury respectively.\nHowever, Benik Afobe, Jordon Ibe and Stanislas provided the necessary attacking prowess in the absence of the senior pair, especially during the opening quarter.\nPlaying with a considerable wind behind them, the Cherries posed a threat on the break and they netted twice before Stoke had fully acclimatised to the blustery conditions.\nSurman's effort came at the end of an incisive move that involved a driving run down the right from Adam Smith and a neat lay-off from Stanislas.\nMinutes later, another break ended with Afobe being bundled to the ground by Shawcross - showing some rustiness in his first game since August - with Stanislas converting from the spot.\nThe Cherries were penned back for much of the second half and were wobbling when Stoke scored, but they dug in, demonstrating a resilience that will put them in good stead.\nThe win is their first on the road in five attempts in the league and while it does not lift them out of the top flight's bottom three, it does close the gap with those directly above them, including Stoke.\n\"It's a special win. It was a massive game, with Chelsea to come next week,\" said Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe. \"We didn't want to become detached from the teams above us.\n\"It was a gritty performance. In the first half we were incisive. We looked like we could score but we feared that with the weather conditions it would be a different story in the second half.\"\nMore questions than answers for Stoke\nPrior to Saturday, Stoke's lowly league position came with a caveat courtesy of a tough set of initial fixtures in which they faced Arsenal, both Manchester clubs and Chelsea inside their first eight games.\nIn two of those defeats - against champions Chelsea last month and Manchester City a week ago - they conceded 11 confidence-sapping goals.\nWhile the result at Etihad Stadium was less reflective of the Potters' deficiencies than it was a showcase for the brilliance of Pep Guardiola's currently untouchable side, this highlights more worrying issues.\nIt was too easy for Bournemouth to take control of the game, with the home defence at times too slow and lacking positional sense.\nTheir promising attack came more to the fore after the break with Jese a greater threat down the left, his replacement Peter Crouch offering an aerial presence and Diouf showing his rediscovered instinct in front of goal for the third game running.\nBut the opening 18 minutes left them with too much to do and boss Mark Hughes must now work out how he can arrest a run of form that has yielded one league win since 19 August and seen them slide into the danger zone.\nHughes added: \"Everybody says we start slowly in the Premier League, but until this week it was our third best start.\n\"We've done OK up until this point but this week has damaged that view. We've got to make sure we get back on track at Watford at the weekend.\"\nMan of the match - Junior Stanislas (Bournemouth)\nStoke failing to enforce home rule - the stats you need to know\nStoke have lost five of their last 10 home league games (W3 D2).\nAndrew Surman has netted two goals in his last five Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 81.\nThere were 133 seconds between Bournemouth's two goals.\nMame Biram Diouf has bagged three goals in eight games this season, two more than his total of one from 27 top-flight games last season.\nEric Maxim Choupo-Moting has been directly involved in four goals in his last four Premier League games at Stoke (two goals, two assists).\nDarren Fletcher made his 100th consecutive Premier League appearance - the longest current run in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nStoke's fixtures do not get any easier. Next Saturday they are at high-flying Watford (15:00 BST), smarting from a narrow defeat at Chelsea this weekend.\nBournemouth host Championship side Middlesbrough in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (19:45) before hosting Chelsea in the Premier League (17:30) on Saturday."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-2 Leicester City\nLeicester made a winning start to life after the dismissal of Craig Shakespeare as they outplayed Swansea City to earn only a second Premier League victory of the season.\nThe visitors created a host of chances and took the lead when Federico Fernandez headed into his own net from Riyad Mahrez's whipped cross.\nA swift counter-attack saw Shinji Okazaki score Leicester's second early in the second half, before Alfie Mawson hooked in from close range to spark hopes of a Swansea revival.\nBut the sluggish hosts struggled to create scoring opportunities as they slumped to a fourth defeat from five home league games this season.\n\"It is very difficult when you lose the manager and I wasn't sure what response we would get,\" said 41-year-old former Oxford boss Appleton, who took charge following Shakespeare's sacking on Tuesday.\n\"It has been a difficult week. To produce that performance after the week we have had, the players deserve a lot of credit.\n\"One game doesn't make you a Premier League manager and I'm very aware of that.\n\"But I'm also aware that I'd like to think as an assistant I'm more than capable of doing that role.\n\"I've done [the assistant role] twice now - I had 15 months at West Brom and here at Leicester - and I'd love an opportunity to continue to do that.\"\nVictory lifts Leicester up to 13th in the table, while Swansea drop to 15th, level on points with Stoke in the relegation zone.\nClement laments Swans' 'step backwards'\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nRelive the action at the Liberty Stadium\nManagerless Leicester impress\nThis fixture had become synonymous with managerial change, starting two seasons ago when a Mahrez hat-trick gave Leicester a 3-0 win and consigned then Swansea boss Garry Monk to the sack.\nLast term, it was a 2-0 Swans victory which proved to be Claudio Ranieri's final game as Leicester manager and, this time, the Foxes responded superbly to the departure of Ranieri's successor, Shakespeare.\nAppleton could have had a goal within one minute of his tenure's start as Okazaki had a header saved by Lukasz Fabianski, and the Polish goalkeeper was at full stretch soon after to tip over Marc Albrighton's firm effort.\nThe verve in Leicester's play and the frequency with which they carved Swansea open was in stark contrast to the uninspiring draw at home to West Brom on Monday which had ultimately cost Shakespeare his job.\nThe only concern for Appleton was that his players had not turned their superiority into a wider winning margin, though those worries were eased with a second goal four minutes after the interval.\nIt was a goal which typified Leicester's display, with Albrighton instigating the counter-attack with a darting run and chipping ahead to Mahrez, who squared the ball for Okazaki to tap in from close range.\nSwansea's home struggles continue\nSwansea ended a run of three successive home league defeats with victory over Huddersfield last week, though their insipid start against Leicester suggested their improvement at the Liberty Stadium would be short-lived.\nTammy Abraham scored both goals against Huddersfield but the striker on loan from Chelsea had no service or support from his team-mates on this occasion, as the home side struggled to cope with the high tempo set by their energetic opponents.\nEven though Okazaki's goal appeared to have opened the floodgates for Leicester, Swansea gave themselves an improbable route back as Mawson struck from a corner, turning smartly and firing into the bottom corner.\nIt was a goal from nothing and, although Leicester retreated in the closing stages, they seldom seemed troubled by their unimaginative hosts.\nSwansea launched a few balls forward in hope rather than expectation and, despite a couple of half-chances for Wayne Routledge and Jordan Ayew, this was another poor performance which laid bare the shortcomings of Paul Clement's side.\n\"The performance in the first half was what let us down,\" said Clement.\n\"Their first goal was marginally offside but from a performance point of view we have to be better. We made a step back.\n\"It was frustrating and I'm disappointed to have gone backwards.\"\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez\nOwn goal curse for Swans - the best stats\nSince the start of 2015/16, Swansea have scored 11 own goals, more than twice as many as any other side\nNo player has scored more Premier League own goals since the start of 2015/16 than Fernandez (3 - level with Jack Cork)\nOkazaki has scored five goals in his last nine Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 51 in the competition\nMahrez has had a hand in two goals in his last two Premier League games (1 goal, 1 assist), as many as in his previous 10 in the competition.\nMahrez has had a hand in five Premier League goals against the Swans (4 goals, 1 assist); against no other side has the winger been involved in more goals in the competition (also 5 v West Brom)\nJordan Ayew has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other current Swansea player since his debut in the competition in February 2017 (7 - 2 goals, 5 assists)\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Leeds United in the fourth round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday at 19:45 BST. Swansea will look to bounce back at home to Manchester United in their EFL Cup fixture on the same night."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-0 West Bromwich Albion\nSubstitute Sofiane Boufal scored a sublime individual goal as Southampton snatched a late winner against a West Brom side who remain without a win since August.\nThe Morocco international picked the ball up deep in his own half and evaded several challenges before curling into the bottom corner with five minutes remaining.\nHis manager Mauricio Pellegrino called it one of the \"most beautiful goals of this season\" on a day when his side's recent tendency to miss chances on home soil continued, while West Brom's lack of ambition proved costly.\nSaints' Ryan Bertrand struck the woodwork with a fine early free-kick, before Shane Long missed from three yards as his wait for a goal extended to 26 games.\nWest Brom - forced to reshuffle at the back when Jonny Evans went off injured - defended stoutly and could have led after the break when Jay Rodriguez beat the offside trap but fired well wide.\nTony Pulis' side looked content with a point for long spells and they have now won only twice in 18 league matches - a figure they will do well to improve upon with fixtures against Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham to come in their next four games.\nRelive Boufal's stunning winner\nBoufal applies finishing touch\nWhen Boufal was introduced on 81 minutes his side looked like they would fail to win for the 10th time in 11 home games.\nGoals have been hard to come by - Mauricio Pellegrino's side have failed to score in eight of those 11 matches - and for long spells the quality of their final pass and shooting failed to match their obvious effort.\nLong was a prime example as he made selfless runs but when his moment arrived at the end of a rapid counter-attack he could only prod wide.\nManolo Gabbiadini, who scored twice against Newcastle last week, produced only tame efforts, while Maya Yoshida and Dusan Tadic had efforts saved, and Charlie Austin found the woodwork from a narrow angle in injury time.\nIn all, the home side hit the target only six times from 20 attempts but Boufal's goal deservedly won the game as he slalomed past challenges before coolly picking his spot to move Southampton up to 10th in the table.\nThe 24-year-old - a \u00a316m signing in August 2016 - has started only one league game this season, but suggested he can fulfil a more important role while Pellegrino's other options find a goalscoring touch.\nAfterwards, Match of the Day pundit Phil Neville said: \"What I liked about the run was the balance and the finish was sublime. One of the goals of the season we have seen so far. I will criticise him though for running up to the manager to prove a point. Go up and give him a hug, calm down.\"\nDid Pulis get it wrong?\nPulis may face some criticism for his approach against a side who arguably carry limited threat compared to others in the league.\nAlthough West Brom are 13th in the table, wins in their first two games this season remain their only league victories since March.\nThe Baggies are used to conceding possession and this was the 93rd time in 103 matches under Pulis they have seen less of the ball than their opponents.\nWith Salomon Rondon leading the line on his own, they struggled to create openings and Pulis admitted they were \"flat\" in a first-half where they had just one touch in the home penalty area.\nRodriguez had time to take a touch when he shot first time to drill their best opening wide after half-time, while a Nacer Chadli effort from range was their only other shot on target.\nAhmed Hegazi was again impressive at the heart of their defence and there could be greater onus on him in a testing run of fixtures if the news is not good when both Evans and Craig Dawson have scans on injuries on Sunday.\nMan of the match - Sofiane Boufal\nBaggies' possession worry - the stats\nSaints have scored just six goals in their last 11 Premier League home games.\nOf Premier League fixtures played at least 15 times, games between these two sides have averaged just 1.47 goals per game (22 goals in 15 games), fewer than any other clash.\nThe Baggies have posted a league-low 37% possession figure in the Premier League this season.\nSofiane Boufal's goal was his first in his last 23 Premier League appearances, since netting against Middlesbrough in December 2016.\n'He's gone past five players' - manager reaction\nSouthampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was a physical game, the weather conditions wasn't the best, but we put them under pressure. We created chances and scored at the end.\n\"Sofiane has got ability to do it, we had to change at the end because they put five defenders. We made the right decision and got the victory for more confidence for the next game.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis on Boufal's goal: \"The viewers will see it and think it's a wonderful goal. He's going past five players, one or two you'd hope would do better. It's disappointing.\n\"Second half we changed it and had a lot more chances. We really had the best opportunity of the game - if we score there it's a different game.\"\nUp next?\nWest Brom host Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday at 15:00 BST, while Southampton travel to south-coast rivals Brighton next Sunday (13:30)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-5 Arsenal\nManager Ronald Koeman says he can turn Everton's fortunes around after they slipped into the Premier League relegation zone with a 5-2 defeat by Arsenal at Goodison Park.\nEverton were embarrassed in front of their own fans, and have now not won in five games in all competitions.\nKoeman said the \"rumours\" about his position are \"normal\".\n\"The team is underperforming. It is in a difficult situation mentally,\" the Dutchman said.\n\"That is what we need to change. I still believe I can change the whole situation but everybody knows how it works in football. That is all I answer about this situation so ask somebody else.\n\"It is how you look to the situation. If you start to think negative then maybe there is no solution. I am not like that.\"\nIt feels like everyone at Everton has had enough - Claridge\nWith only two league wins this season, Everton were given early hope when Wayne Rooney re-enacted his famous goal against Arsenal from 2002 as a 16-year-old with a brilliant 20-yard curling finish past Petr Cech.\nIt was to prove a false dawn as only Everton keeper Jordan Pickford kept his side on terms before Nacho Monreal reacted to a rebound from his save to draw Arsenal level.\nArsenal never looked back and it was no surprise when the outstanding pair of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil combined for the German to head past the besieged Pickford eight minutes after half-time.\nEverton collapsed in humiliating fashion, Idrissa Gueye making matters worse when a senseless tackle on Granit Xhaka earned him his second yellow card.\nAlexandre Lacazette and Aaron Ramsey increased the agony for Koeman and Everton with goals in the final 16 minutes.\nEven when Everton substitute Oumar Niasse pulled one back in stoppage time, there was still time for Sanchez to end a slalom run with a fifth to bring the curtain down on a desperate day for Koeman, who is now surely fighting to save his job.\nIs this the end for Koeman?\nThe eerie silence that descended on Goodison Park for the majority of the match was the most ominous symbol of all for Koeman.\nGoodison Park is normally the most hostile of arenas but the air of resignation was a clear sign how the life and hope has been sucked out of Everton's season after the optimism of that busy and big-spending summer in the transfer market.\nGoalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who stood alone between Everton and an even more serious beating here, has been a shining light since his \u00a330m summer from Sunderland, and, for all the questions about his signing, Rooney still possesses more class and vision that just about any of his team-mates.\nOther than that, Everton look a tactical and technical mess, the muddled thinking graphically illustrated by the movable feast - or famine - that is Koeman's team selection.\nSo assured last season, he does not appear to know his best formation or his best team - or, as one wag put it, he does not know his worst team.\nWhen Tom Davies replaced Ashley Williams at half-time, it was the ninth time in 17 games this season that Koeman has made a substitution at the interval. This is a telling statistic.\nGylfi Sigurdsson, Everton's \u00a345m record signing, looks lost and the swathes of empty seats that Koeman looked out on at the final whistle will also have resonated with major shareholder Farhad Moshiri.\nEverton are now so rudderless and lacking in inspiration that it is hard to see where Koeman goes from here.\nMoshiri gave Koeman his backing two weeks ago, but this was such a desperately poor performance that it is impossible to believe he is not revisiting that support.\nThe jeers from the few fans that remained at the final whistle only underlined the crisis that now threatens to totally envelope the beleaguered Koeman.\n'Everton in real trouble'\nFormer Leicester City striker Steve Claridge said \"something has to change quickly\" at Everton.\n\"On this evidence, Everton are in real, real trouble,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"There were very few redeeming features about their play. There is no belief in what they are doing and they are not good enough to play like that.\n\"There is no reaction to what is going on. The fans have just given up reacting. Apathy is too strong a word but they look like they've had the guts knocked out of them.\n\"The best they could do is get men behind the ball - no balance, no shape, the system didn't suit the players and there was no quality. Arsenal had five and it could have been a lot more.\"\nBefore the game, Claridge said Koeman should be shown patience. Asked if he had changed his mind, he said: \"Yes I have. I am not advocating people leave their job but something has to change quickly.\"\nHow would Arsenal cope without Sanchez and Ozil?\nAs Arsenal celebrated the easiest of victories at the final whistle, their fans tucked away in one corner of the ground may not have been pondering a thorny question facing manager Arsene Wenger.\nAlexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil are both running down their Arsenal contracts and look certain to leave the club, perhaps as early as January, but both produced performances that underlined just how much they would be missed.\nSanchez showed no signs of any discontent or hangover from his failed move to Manchester City.\nThe Chile forward was inventive, endlessly aggressive, created one goal for Ozil with a perfect cross and finished of the win with a glorious slalom run and shot across Pickford.\nOzil was at his graceful best, picking his way through midfield, selecting the finest from his wide range of passes and ghosting in for a fine header that gave Arsenal a crucial lead they never looked like relinquishing.\nArsenal's immediate future hangs heavily on these two players and Wenger may decide it is more palatable to take the long-term financial hit rather than lose what they could give him in the latter months of the season when the January transfer window opens.\nArsenal given easy ride\nArsenal's character and heart for battle was questioned by Watford striker Troy Deeney\n, external\nafter the Hornets' win last weekend, but Everton allowed the Gunners to rebuild their confidence without a hint of trouble.\nIf Everton had taken any note whatsoever of Deeney's message that Arsenal may be frail under the physical exchanges, they did not show any evidence of it.\nArsenal strolled around midfield - or what passed as Everton's midfield - almost unchallenged, giving Ozil and Aaron Ramsey free rein to provide service for Sanchez and Lacazette to inflict the punishment that eventually overwhelmed Koeman's bedraggled side.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\n'There are no excuses in football' - Koeman\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"The position in the table is not the position Everton should be in.\n\"Even after today, I see a lot of positives. It is a negative situation for the team - everything is negative - but I am not like that.\n\"We had a lot of expectation after last season. Those expectations are not filling in - that makes the situation difficult.\"\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger told BBC Sport: \"After Wayne Rooney's goal, I thought 17 years later, 'we are here again'.\n\"That was a test for us. We should have been 2-0 or 3-0 up at that stage. It was about how we responded to that - could we keep calm? We did that in a convincing way. Our passing and movement was excellent.\n\"It's very difficult to single out any performances as everyone played very well. It was important to get our first win away from home.\"\nArsenal hit 100 against the Toffees - the stats\nArsenal have beaten Everton more times than any other club have beaten another in English Football League history (95 wins).\nArsenal have now scored 100 Premier League goals against Everton, the first time a club has reached the landmark against one team.\nThis is the 20th instance of a manager winning a Premier League game on his birthday and the third time that Arsene Wenger has done this (2005, 2006 and 2017) - more often than any other manager.\nThis is Everton's worst points tally (8) after nine games of a Premier League season since 2005-06 - when they had four points but finished the campaign in 11th place.\nSince beating Leicester City in September 2015, Arsenal have trailed in 20 different Premier League away matches. This is the first of those 20 games that they have won.\nArsenal had 14 shots on target in the match, the most they have managed in a Premier League away game since 2003-04.\nMesut Ozil assisted his 43rd Premier League goal. He has more assists than any other player in the competition since his debut in September 2013.\nWayne Rooney has now scored 12 Premier League goals against Arsenal, more than any other player.\nRooney has scored seven Premier League goals against Petr Cech, more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nEverton visit Chelsea in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday (19:45 BST), before travelling to Leicester in the Premier League on Sunday (16:00 GMT).\nArsenal are also in cup action on Tuesday against Norwich (19:45), then host Swansea on Saturday (15:00)."

Being down one goal at Tottenham, you can fix it. The third is down to completely not concentrating off the ball. Four mistakes from us.\n\"It is my responsibility. I don't coach the type of defending for the first throw-in. The second goal, we miss the ball and then Son is quicker. We put it on a plate.\n\"It's not about confidence. It's just about being 100% spot on. It was a really average day for us today.\"\nReds captain Jordan Henderson added: \"I know Dejan Lovren came off but it could have been any of us that came off.\n\"We got back into it but concede a sloppy goal that kills us.

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur\nAnthony Martial's late winner kept Manchester United in second place in the Premier League as they edged out Spurs in a hard-fought encounter at Old Trafford.\nMartial's introduction for Marcus Rashford after 70 minutes was not well received by some Manchester United supporters - but manager Jose Mourinho's move proved to be a masterstroke as the French striker raced on to Romelu Lukaku's header to beat Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris with only nine minutes left.\nIt was a narrow victory United just about deserved after creating the better chances in the second half, Lukaku producing an outstanding save from Lloris and hitting the woodwork with a header.\nSpurs missed the goalscoring threat and presence of the injured Harry Kane, creating little other than a chance which Dele Alli steered just wide from Christian Eriksen's cross with the game still goalless.\nIn the end, Mourinho's change and Martial's penalty box finish made the difference as United recovered from last week's surprise loss at Huddersfield Town.\nWhat happened today in the Premier League?\nThe 10 best stats from Saturday's action\nMourinho hits back at critics\nMourinho switch pays off\nWhen Mourinho removed Rashford and sent on Martial with 20 minutes left, sections of Old Trafford signalled - and indeed gestured - their disapproval at the move.\nIt was actually the catalyst for United's match-winning surge as they finally pierced the defensive barrier erected by Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino.\nRomelu Lukaku, who had endured a frustrating afternoon, burst into life with a run and shot that was brilliantly saved by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris then had a header that bounced to safety off the post.\nUnited built momentum after Mourinho's change and it was Lukaku who rose to send a header into Martial's path for a finish that was not clean but good enough.\nMourinho had criticism to contend with for his approach to the goalless draw at Liverpool a fortnight ago - but here he made the tactical tweak that proved decisive.\nThe Harry Kane Team?\nPochettino was, with very good reason, outraged by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's description of Tottenham as \"the Harry Kane team.\"\nThere is so much more to Spurs than that in the shape of Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and a superbly-drilled defence - but here they missed that edge of menace the 24-year-old would have provided.\nSpurs are not 'the Harry Kane team' in the slightest - but any side in the world would miss a striker in the sort of form England's captain is currently in.\nSon Heung-min battled hard before he was replaced by Fernando Llorente but neither could replicate the sort of threat Kane has been producing in recent weeks.\nMourinho will also point out he was missing key midfielder Paul Pogba - but there was no doubt, despite the defiant message from Pochettino before the kick-off, that Spurs were dealt a huge blow to their plans by Kane's hamstring injury.\nLukaku's persistence is rewarded - and Young is re-born\nLukaku was given a real show of faith by Mourinho when he persisted with the striker after deciding to make changes.\nIt could just as easily have been Lukaku who was withdrawn rather than Rashford as the game entered its final phase - but Mourinho stuck with his summer purchase from Everton and it paid dividends.\nThe \u00a390m striker had been a figure of frustration for much of the game as he gestured to his team-mates for greater and quicker support as he battled against Eric Dier, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld.\nAnd yet, through sheer persistence and determination, he was able to make a key contribution to set up Martial's late winner.\nAnother key figure for United was the rejuvenated Ashley Young, employed down the left-flank, defending tirelessly and occasionally delivering the sort of dangerous crosses that were his trademark as a flying winger.\nHe fully deserved the standing ovation he received from Old Trafford when he was taken off in stoppage time.\nMan of the match - Ashley Young\nWhat they said\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"That was difficult, it could have been a draw. Both teams were trying to win but both knew the opponent was strong.\n\"Apart from Dele Alli's chance, we controlled them well. It was tactically difficult for both and it was well refereed. It was strong, aggressive.\n\"We knew if we had one defensive mistake we could lose and that's what happened to them.\n\"We tried and we deserved the victory.\"\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was an even game. It was a shame to lose. The chances were for one and then the other. It was a tough game and I think we deserved more. I feel proud of the effort and it was unlucky that in the last 10 minutes we conceded our goal. It was our mistake.\n\"It is important to be calm and in football these type of mistakes happen. We must fix that and move on. We cannot change the result.\n\"We contained United very well. Always we were in control of the game.

We had the better chances, with Saido [Berahino] and Charlie [Adam] at the end - he told me he lost his bearing.\n\"But overall it's a good performance, we've had a tough set of fixtures.\"\nWatford manager Marco Silva: \"In the first half we gave 45 minutes to our opponents. We were too slow and not in our normal image.\n\"We gave one gift, the goal. In that moment we lost our focus and they scored a good goal. The second half was mostly our team, they played with 10 men behind the ball. It is normal when a team is in that position in the table.\n\"We created some chances to change the score, but didn't. We tried until the end.\n\"We needed to do something different and in the first-half we didn't do that.\"\nWhy Stoke love playing Watford - the stats\nWatford have lost their last four games against Stoke, after winning four of the previous six (D2) and keeping a clean sheet in each match in that run.\nStoke have now won four consecutive matches against Watford for the first time since December 2004 under Tony Pulis.\nThe Hornets mustered 14 shots in the game without directing any on target; only Burnley managed more shots in a Premier League game this season without directing one on target (20 v West Brom in August).\nWatford have suffered consecutive league defeats for the first time this season, and since losing their last six league games of 2016-17.\nDarren Fletcher netted his first Premier League goal in his last 26 appearances in the competition, since scoring for West Brom v Sunderland on 21 January 2017.\nXherdan Shaqiri has been involved in four goals in his last six top-flight games (one goal, three assists), after just three goal involvements in the 19 games before that.\nMan of the match - Kurt Zouma (Stoke City)\nWhat's next?\nStoke return to action with a home match against Leicester City on Saturday, 4 November (12:30 GMT); for Watford it is a trip to Merseyside to face Everton on Sunday, 5 November (16:30 GMT)."

It can happen.\n\"The first goal against Huddersfield we forced the situation. The second one after a set-piece felt like Christmas. We had a lot of good set-pieces today.\n\"The third one was nice play. Big relief.\"\nHuddersfield, who arrived at Anfield on the back of a fine 2-1 win over Manchester United, had frustrated the hosts in the first half before crumbling.\n\"Until the first goal we played defensively very well, we neutralised them. I haven't seen Anfield so quiet until the first goal,\" said Wagner.\n\"If you give one small chance away, they will punish you.\"\nWhat happened on Saturday in the Premier League?\nSaturday's 10 best Premier League stats\nSealed with a kiss\nKlopp reacted at the final whistle by planting a kiss on the Huddersfield manager's cheek, yet there was little to love about Liverpool's first-half performance.\nThe Reds were deprived of the services of Philippe Coutinho because of injury while Dejan Lovren was also unable to start after getting hurt in the warm-up, Ragnar Klavan coming into the team.\nYet what followed was 45 minutes of pedestrian football by the hosts, who looked like they were suffering a hangover from last weekend.\nMohamed Salah's penalty, after Tommy Smith had pulled Firmino to the ground, summed up Liverpool's frustrations as Jonas Lossl beat the ball away and Jordan Henderson's first-time shot clipped the post.\nHowever, it was a different story after the interval.\nSmith's headed clearance fell straight to Sturridge, who advanced before lifting the ball over Lossl for his first goal since 27 August.\nSuddenly, Liverpool were all flair and attack-minded.\nFirminho's header from James Milner's corner gave the Reds some breathing space and it was game over when Wijnaldum smashed home the third.\nDays like this have been too rare for Liverpool this season.\nHome comforts for Reds\nFor all the criticism Liverpool have received for their defensive performances, this was their fourth clean sheet in five top-flight games at Anfield.\nThe Reds have entertained, amongst others, Arsenal and Manchester United yet Burnley remain the only team to scored at the venue in the league.\nHuddersfield managed just one shot - Tom Ince's free-kick late in the game sailing high and wide as Simon Mignolet enjoyed a quiet shift.\nIt's an entirely different story on the road for Liverpool and their defence.\nThey have conceded 15 in five games on opposition soil in the league. Klopp knows he must address that record if Liverpool are to secure another top-four finish.\nAway concerns for Terriers\nHuddersfield's top-flight fate will not depend on this outcome or results at any of the other 'big six' in the Premier League.\nIt is their home form that will decide whether they stay up and last week's win over Jose Mourinho's United shows there is plenty of fight and spirit within the squad.\nYet Wagner will be disappointed with the way his side collapsed after winning the first-half tactical battle.\nHuddersfield came to defend and they did that well until Smith's error let in Sturridge. There will be concern that there was little sign of a fightback after that.\nAlthough the Terriers have picked up four points away from home, they have not scored in the past four league away games.\nMan of the match - Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool)\nGerman boss yet penalty woes for Reds - the stats\nNo side has missed more Premier League penalties than Liverpool (34, level with Arsenal).\nRoberto Firmino has scored 24 Premier League goals, more than any other Liverpool player since his debut in August 2015.\nHuddersfield have failed to score in four consecutive away league games for the first time since October 2007, when they were in the third tier (5 games in that run).\nAll 18 of Georginio Wijnaldum's Premier League goals have come in home games (11 at St James' Park for Newcastle, 7 at Anfield for Liverpool).\nIndeed, Wijnaldum's haul of 18 is the most goals exclusively scored at home by any player in Premier League history.\nWhat's next?\nIt's back to Anfield for Liverpool on Wednesday when Slovenian side Maribor visit in the Champions League (19:45 GMT) before a match at London Stadium against West Ham on 4 November (17:30 GMT).\nHuddersfield have a week to dust themselves down and prepare for West Brom's visit on November 4 (15:00 GMT)."

It was the first touch Swansea had managed inside Arsenal's penalty area.\nBut two quick goals after the interval maintained Arsenal's 100% home record this season, with Sead Kolasinac firing in an equaliser before cutting back from the left for Ramsey to steer in via the foot of goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nKolasinac eases Arsenal's troubles\nIt was a happier end to the week for Wenger, who revealed during Thursday's stormy AGM that his position would be reviewed at the end of the season, even though he signed a two-year contract in May.\nThose comments add an extra degree of uncertainty to Arsenal's long-term future, with Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez both widely expected to leave when their contracts expire at the end of the season.\nOzil, Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette played together as an attacking trio for only the second time - but their chief threat came from elsewhere.\nKolasinac, playing in the left wing-back role, provided their attacking impetus, taking every chance to get forward as Arsenal laboured in the first half, before playing a central role in the turnaround.\nThe Bosnia-Herzegovina international finished a terrific move for the equaliser, as Arsenal finally managed to pass their way around and through a well-organised Swansea side.\nHector Bellerin, Granit Xhaka, Lacazette and Ozil were all involved, with the German's shot bouncing off a defender and running loose for Kolasinac to thump in via a deflection.\nThe wing-back's positive run to the byeline then set up Ramsey for the second, and there were other inspired moments, notably a beautiful, dragged backheel that sent Sanchez away down the left for a cross-shot that was saved.\n\"I liked his game today,\" Wenger said. \"He had a good finish on the goal and some good combinations on the left, leading to the assist for the second.\n\"Once he scored, the confidence grew and he became more and more dangerous.\"\nStubborn Swansea rue Ayew miss\nSwansea have been very hard to break down away from home this season, despite their poor league position.\nFor much of this game, it looked as if that run would continue, as head coach Paul Clement switched to a 5-3-2 system that smothered Arsenal's passing game.\nJohn Motson, commentating for Match of the Day, described the early exchanges as \"cat and mouse\" - but it was the mouse that roared first.\nClucas timed his run perfectly in from the left on to Abraham's through pass and rolled a finish past Petr Cech to leave the home side shocked.\nAbraham, watched by England manager Gareth Southgate, turned in a highly commendable performance, increasing his chances of a first senior call-up for the November friendlies against Germany and Brazil.\nSwansea created little in terms of clear chances, but will regret passing up a great opportunity to go 2-0 up just before half-time.\nJordan Ayew dispossessed a hesitant Per Mertesacker inside the penalty area, and only had Cech to beat - but the Arsenal goalkeeper stayed calm and blocked with his knee.\nMan of the match - Sead Kolasinac (Arsenal)\nWhat they said\nArsenal goalscorer Aaron Ramsey: \"It was difficult in the first half but we stuck at it. We have quality players in this team. I'm delighted we won and kept our 100% home record.\n\"I'm pleased to reach 50 goals for this club. I hope there are a few more to come.\"\nSwansea head coach Paul Clement: \"It is frustrating in terms of results but we saw some positive things.

We did all the right things. We are buzzing and we deserved it,\" said Zaha. \"The manager said at half-time that we were not playing badly.\n\"The stress must be crazy as a Palace fan. We are playing cup finals every week.\"\nOne step forward, two steps back\nWest Ham's remarkable comeback from two goals down in their Carabao Cup tie at Tottenham on Wednesday suggested that reports of Slaven Bilic's imminent sacking were a tad premature.\nThe Hammers' stirring response at Wembley showcased a determination and togetherness previously lacking in what has been a dire start to a Premier League campaign that plumbed new depths with last Friday's 3-0 home loss against Brighton.\nBilic admitted that this result \"felt like a defeat\", with the final blow coming deep into a game in which they had shown an initial ruthlessness and then backs-to-the-wall resolve.\nThe first half was full of positives for the Hammers, who drafted in four of their protagonists from Wednesday's game - Ogbonna and Cresswell at the back, Mark Noble in midfield and Ayew, scorer of two in that game, in attack.\nIt was from Cresswell's cross that Hernandez opened the scoring with a neat finish using the outside of his boot, before Ayew scored the game's best goal, a long-range finish off the underside of the bar following a jinking run.\nAfter conceding early in the second half they showed a resolve that has been largely lacking this season, but tarnished it in the game's final moments.\nGiven the opportunity to hold on to the ball deep in Palace territory, and with 96 minutes on the clock, substitute Michail Antonio fired a loose and pointless cross straight into the arms of home keeper Julian Speroni.\nLess than a minute later, the home side were level and the under-pressure Bilic was storming to the changing room shaking his head in frustration.\n\"We knew that the game was not over at 2-0 up at half-time,\" said Bilic. \"I am very disappointed with the penalty, but the way we conceded the leveller was very disappointing.\n\"We needed to keep the ball and we made the wrong decision, with Michail Antonio choosing to cross the ball rather than keep it.\n\"We have to manage the game on the pitch. The game was finished.\"\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\nPalace still to keep a clean sheet - the stats you need to know\nCrystal Palace are one of just four teams in the big 5 European leagues yet to keep a clean sheet this season (also Benevento, Malaga and Dijon).\nWest Ham are unbeaten in the Premier League versus Crystal Palace under Slaven Bilic (W3 D2 L0).\nAll 41 of Javier Hernandez's Premier League goals have been scored from inside the box; only Tim Cahill (56/56) has a higher 100% record.\nAndre Ayew has scored three goals in his last two games in all competitions for West Ham - more than he'd managed in his previous 10 this season (2).\nWest Ham scored with both of their shots on target in this match.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams have tough fixtures. Palace travel to Tottenham on Sunday for a 12:00 BST Premier League kick-off.\nWest Ham are at home to Liverpool the day before (17:30)."

We need to be clinical if we want to win titles but football is unpredictable.\"\nSaturday's 10 best Premier League stats\nManchester clubs power on - Premier League round-up\nGermany winger Sane sent City on their way when his vicious strike from 15 yards flew past keeper Ben Foster. That was his eighth goal of the season, the same as strikers Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus.\nThe Baggies hit back only three minutes later when Jay Rodriguez lifted his effort past Ederson after Gareth Barry played him in.\nBut the euphoria from the home support returned to derision soon after the restart when Sane supplied Fernandinho and his drive deflected off a couple of Baggies players and hit the foot of the post before trickling in.\nWest Brom once again sat back after the break and were punished in the 64th minute when substitute Raheem Sterling tapped in his ninth of the season after a swift move started by the excellent Sane.\nPhillips anticipated well to score Albion's second late on, after City defender Nicolas Otamendi tried to chest the ball back to his keeper Ederson, but there was barely enough time for West Brom to mount another attack as City made it 28 points from 30.\nSane more than a support act\nSane's pedigree was never in doubt, but his rapid ascension since joining City in August 2016 might have surprised a few.\nThe German is only 21 but is proving to be an indispensable figure in Pep Guardiola's side.\nThe former Schalke midfielder, who scored nine goal in 37 appearances in his first campaign, was outstanding on the left and, with forward Gabriel Jesus off key, the most potent threat for City.\nHis goal was memorable. Fernandinho found his team-mate with a 10-yard pass and Sane jinked one way then the other before he arrowed in a fierce effort from the left of the area.\nHe turned provider when he laid the ball to Fernandinho for the second before beginning the sweeping move for the third, which started on the left and was quickly passed across the edge of the box before Kyle Walker delivered the telling cross for Sterling.\nEarlier this week, Sane praised Guardiola for changing his game\n, external\n- his teacher will have been further pleased with his player's progress.\nBaggies continue to lack bounce\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis said this week that criticism is part of the job\n, external\nand while the display against City might have placated some, the statistics read: drawn four, lost four of their last eight league games - although this was their first home defeat of the season in the league.\nAlbion were once again set up to sit deep and counter, but that was only effective on a handful of occasions, one of which led to their opener.\nThe result leaves the Baggies in 14th, two points above the relegation zone.\n\"The lads really worked hard,\" said Pulis afterwards. \"There is a gulf in quality in certain areas of the pitch.\n\"You look at Salomon Rondon's chance in the first half and Grzegorz Krychowiak's chance - there were a couple of opportunities you hope you can take.\n\"It's difficult against a team this good, but the lads will come out with a lot of credit.\n\"I thought we would get chances irrespective of the City side.\"\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Manchester City)\nSterling on cloud nine - the stats\nManchester City have made the best start to a Premier League season after 10 games, collecting 28 points (won nine, drawn one) with a goal difference of+29.\nThe Citizens are now unbeaten in 21 games in all competitions (won 17, drawn four) - the longest run without defeat in their history.\nGuardiola's side have now won their last eight Premier League games by an aggregate score of 32-5.\nCity completed 844 passes in this game; the most by a team in the Premier League since the start of the 2003-04 campaign.\nWest Brom, meanwhile, have lost 15 of their last 16 Premier League games against Manchester City (drawn one), conceding 43 goals in this run.\nSterling has scored nine goals in all competitions in 2017-18; the most of any Manchester City player, while only Harry Kane (13) and Romelu Lukaku (11) have netted more among Premier League players.\nSane has had a hand in 11 goals in his last seven Premier League games for Man City (six goals, five assists).\nWhat's next?\nThe Baggies are at Huddersfield in the league next Saturday (15:00 GMT) while City are at Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) before hosting Arsenal next Sunday (14:15 GMT)"

It's a challenge as we've gone from being a free-scoring team.\n\"I don't see a problem with the creative players we've got, we just need to find the right formula.\"\nJermain Defoe, absent for the last two games with a hamstring injury, struggled to make an impact and was replaced at half-time in what Howe admitted after the match was a tactical move.\nThe hosts improved in the second half and enjoyed better possession than before the break, but their lack of threat will worry Howe.\nUnited the next test for Chelsea\nFor all the focus on Conte regarding his training methods and rumours the club may look to former manager Carlo Ancelotti, his side are unbeaten in their last five outings across all competitions.\nThey face Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday, but their next Premier League match sees the visit of Manchester United on Sunday, 5 November.\nChelsea's last defeat came when Manchester City visited Stamford Bridge, with the 1-0 result not reflecting how convincingly the home side were beaten that day.\nMan of the match - Cesar Azpilicueta\nWhat they said\nBournemouth coach Eddie Howe: \"We were resilient but too passive in the first half. We had to change things and we did. We are disappointed with the goal, but didn't quite have the quality we needed.\n\"I don't think we hurt them, we didn't stretch their back five and a poor touch here and there stopped us. There were positives from the second half, not the first - you have to give Chelsea a lot of credit for that.\n\"I think we have a run of games where we have to do win. I think you need to have a good run during the season, it'll make a huge difference, we're prepared.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"I think we deserved to win because we played good football. When you have a lot of chances to score, I think you must do it.\n\"To keep the result to only 1-0 can be dangerous. I think today that if I have to find a negative aspect, we could be more clinical.\n\"We must be pleased for the clean sheet. It's OK when you don't concede a goal, it means you are finding solidity which is very important for a team like Chelsea. We played a good game with a good balance and finally I think we deserved to win.\"\nHazard has a taste for Cherries - the stats\nEden Hazard has scored five goals in five Premier League appearances against Bournemouth, with four of those strikes arriving on the south coast.\nHazard created seven goalscoring chances in the game; only Mesut Ozil (eight v Everton) has managed more in a single Premier League game this season.\nChelsea have won six of their last seven away Premier League games, losing the other.\nBournemouth have picked up just four points from their five Premier League home games this season (W1 D1 L3), after accruing 10 points from their last five last season (W3 D1 L1).\nTheir tally of just one shot on target is the Cherries' joint-lowest total ever in a home Premier League game.\nAlvaro Morata has been involved in nine goals in his nine Premier League games this season (six goals, three assists).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to the Italian capital to face Roma on Tuesday, 31 October (kick-off 19:45 GMT), then host Manchester United at 16:30 on Sunday, 5 November. Bournemouth's next outing is at Newcastle on Saturday, 4 November, at 15:00."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Southampton\nGlenn Murray scored his third goal in two games as Brighton recovered from going a goal behind to earn a draw against Southampton.\nThe Saints took the lead after only seven minutes when Steven Davis reacted quickest to the loose ball, after James Ward-Prowse's excellent free-kick came off the angle of post and bar.\nDefender Shane Duffy came close to equalising for the Seagulls with a header before the home side drew level on 52 minutes, when 34-year-old Murray nodded in from Pascal Gross' cross.\nBar the two goals, neither goalkeeper was severely tested. Saints' midfielder Dusan Tadic saw his strike deflected wide and striker Manolo Gabbiadini was denied by a sliding block from defender Lewis Dunk.\nThe point moves Southampton to ninth in the Premier League table with 13 points, and Brighton go up one place to 11th with 12 points.\nRelive the action from Amex Stadium\nDo Southampton need shooting practice?\nManager Mauricio Pellegrino will likely be satisfied with his side's top-10 position in the table, but profligacy in front of goal might have cost his Saints a few more positions.\nAs it stands, they have scored the second fewest number of goals (nine) among teams in the top half, but are joint-fifth out of all 20 teams when it comes to efforts on goal (147).\nFormer Napoli forward Gabbiadini is the club's top scorer this season with three goals, but also the most wasteful (13 chances). That 13th effort on goal came after Saints had equalised, when his first-time shot from Ryan Bertrand's low cross was brilliantly blocked by Dunk.\nMidfielder Tadic is another player who gets into the right place at the right time, but he now has a conversion rate of one goal from 11 chances. His one opportunity at Amex Stadium came just before the break, when his strike from Sofiane Boufal's cross was deflected over the bar.\nPellegrino might want to use November's international break for some shooting practice.\nBrighton's dynamic duo strike again\nIn contrast, Brighton are a lowly 14th when it comes to chances created (97) in the league this season, but have scored 10 goals.\nThose statistics might improve further if Murray and Gross continue their good form.\nThe German midfielder, who was the supplier for one of the striker's two goals in the 3-0 win over West Ham, delivered another brilliant ball from the wing for his team-mate, who nodded in at the far post.\nGross, who joined from Ingolstadt in the summer, now has five assists in the league so far - only Manchester City midfielders David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne (six) have more.\nMan of the match - Lewis Dunk (Brighton)\n'Nobody has given us a real beating' - the reaction\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton, talking to Match of the Day: \"I was pleased with the response, When you concede early, the last time we did that at Leicester, we came away with nothing. We got stronger as the game opened up. Southampton are a good technical side. When you go behind early you are just glad to come back.\n\"These are a good side with good quality. We got back into the game and showed good quality. In the final third we had more opportunities to create and thoroughly deserved to be back into it.\n\"In all our games there isn't anybody who has given us a real beating. We have been in most games.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was a game that was really tight. Neither team could completely control the game.\n\"High tempo, up and down but we never controlled it totally, the ball, and create more action. Both teams were compact. My players competed well.\n\"I think it is a season with ups and downs. In terms of results we deserved a few more points but our league is close between 10 and 12 teams from the bottom until around sixth. We are in this group.\"\nGross importance for Brighton - the stats\nSouthampton have won just four of their last 18 Premier League matches (W4 D7 L7).\nMurray has scored as many Premier League goals in his last two appearances (three) as he did in his previous 28 PL apps combined (three).\nGross has been involved in seven of Brighton's 10 Premier League goals this season (two goals, five assists).\nGross has already assisted more league goals this season (five) than he did in both 2016-17 and 2015-16 (both four) for FC Ingolstadt 04 in the Bundesliga.\nThis is the second time this season that Steven Davis has scored from the first shot on target in a Premier League game - he also did this versus Crystal Palace in September. Harry Kane is the only other player to have done this on two occasions this season.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton are away at Swansea and Southampton are at home to Burnley next Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

I hope it's just the beginning of something.\"\nEverton, under caretaker David Unsworth after Ronald Koeman's sacking on Monday, remain in the bottom three.\nAnalysis: Why Unsworth should get the Everton job - Phil Neville\nThey were largely restricted to long-range efforts, but probably should have had a penalty when Christian Fuchs brought down Aaron Lennon soon after Leicester's second goal.\nThough Everton dominated the second half, a lack of incision was indicative of a team that has scored only seven league goals this season and are winless in seven games in all competitions.\nLeicester, meanwhile, have staged a turnaround since a run of six league games without a win cost Shakespeare his job.\nThe 2015-16 Premier League champions have now won three in a row in the top flight and Carabao Cup - two under caretaker boss Michael Appleton and this maiden success for Puel.\nNew top dog, old tricks\nThough Puel guided Southampton to the EFL Cup final last season, his appointment was greeted by derision in some quarters, especially after the Saints managed just 41 league goals last season.\nIn claiming victory on his bow at the King Power Stadium, Puel saw his Leicester side employ the method that brought them a shock title success little more than a year ago.\nEverton had more of the ball, spent more time in the Leicester half and had more players in advanced positions - and yet the home side had the greater threat going forward, especially through their trademark counter-attacks.\nGray, in his his first league start for a month, was excellent, and it was his electrifying pace that created Leicester's first goal.\nAn Everton free-kick was headed clear, with Gray collecting the ball deep in his own half. He evaded three challenges and fed Riyad Mahrez, whose cross was finished at the back post by Vardy.\nThe second goal was tinged with fortune as Gray's cross-shot from the left was sliced past Everton keeper Jordan Pickford by the unlucky Kenny.\nThe home side were under pressure for most of the rest of the contest, but a back four led by Wes Morgan rarely looked like being breached.\n\"I was impressed because we played very well first half with good relationships between the players and it was a fantastic first goal,\" added Puel.\n\"It was a little more difficult in the second half because Everton are a very good team and they tried to come back into the game.\n\"It's a very good result and I also wanted to thank the fantastic fans for their warm welcome and superb atmosphere.\"\nA big job for someone\nUnsworth has stated his desire to be given the reins at Goodison Park full-time and he stamped his mark on the Toffees by relegating \u00a345m summer signing Gylfi Sigurdsson to the bench and giving first league starts of the season to wingers Lennon and Kevin Mirallas.\nThe early problems, though, were at the back, as the central defensive partnership of Phil Jagielka and Ashley Williams, with a combined age of 68, were exposed by Leicester's pace.\nAt the other end, Lennon twice found space down the right - he probably should have taken a shot at goal instead of passing to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who missed his kick, and was unfortunate not to win a penalty when Fuchs' challenge failed to make any contact with the ball.\nMirallas also had two efforts on goal, so it was surprising when both wide men were hauled off at half-time, with Oumar Niasse joining Calvert-Lewin in attack.\nEverton pressed, spending most of the second half in Leicester territory, but their only chances of note were a Jagielka overhead kick and a Leighton Baines effort that dipped over the bar from long range.\nWhoever is given the Everton manager's job will inherit a side that has only scored more goals than Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, conceded more than all but Palace and not won any of their past 13 away league games.\n\"Second half we were much, much better,\" said Unsworth. \"But we gave them a two-goal start because we didn't perform in the first half.\n\"Whoever gets the honour of being Everton manager, myself included, needs time with this set of players because you all have your own set of ideas.\n\"Every coach and manager has their idea of how they want to play, I certainly do, and you need time on the training ground to implement those ideas.\"\nMan of the match - Demarai Gray\nVardy starts the party - the stats\nThe Foxes have taken six points in their last two Premier League games, the same number they managed in their opening eight matches of the season.\nJamie Vardy has been involved in 13 goals in his last 15 Premier League games at the King Power Stadium (11 goals, 2 assists).\nVardy has scored the first Premier League goal under each of the last three Leicester managers (Claudio Ranieri, Craig Shakespeare and Claude Puel).\nRiyad Mahrez has assisted nine of Jamie Vardy's Premier League goals - more than any other player.\nEverton named eight English players in their starting XI, the second time they've done so in the space of nine Premier League games (also against Man City); prior to this, they hadn't done so in any of their previous 780 Premier League games, since naming eight in the starting XI against Manchester United on Boxing Day 1997.\nThe last four managers to take charge of Leicester in the Premier League have all won their first matches in charge (Ranieri, Shakespeare, Appleton and Puel).\nEverton have now conceded 20 goals in the Premier League this season, their most after 10 matches of a league season since 1994-95 (22).\nThe Toffees have used six teenagers in the Premier League since the start of last season, two more than any other club (Ademola Lookman, Mason Holgate, Nikola Vlasic, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Tom Davies and Beni Baningime).\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to Lyon on Thursday (18:00 GMT) knowing that defeat will probably put them out of the Europa League.\nThe Toffees are back in Premier League action at home to Watford next Sunday (16:30), with Leicester at Stoke the day before (12:30)."

It's a marathon and we have made a good start,\" added Dyche.\n\"We never take anything for granted here because you can't do in this division as it's very tough.\"\nThis is Burnley's third season - and second in a row - in the top-flight under Dyche.\nNo longer are the Clarets seen as cannon fodder at this level.\nThis season, they've won at Chelsea and drawn away to both Tottenham and Liverpool, while they are now unbeaten in the past four at Turf Moor.\nThey have played better than they performed against Newcastle in a match which only came to life in the closing quarter.\nThe Clarets were missing club record \u00a315m signing Chris Wood due to a hamstring injury and it looked like they were going to have to settle for a point until Hendrick pounced for his second goal in his last four league games.\nThe Republic of Ireland international could not miss after Gudmundsson's quality cross before, late on, Elliot denied Ashley Barnes from doubling the lead with a one-handed stop.\nNot quite a manic Monday\nNewcastle seemed happy to settle for a point and only showed any real urgency once they fell behind after Perez had carelessly lost possession.\n\"We had the game under control,\" said Magpies boss Rafael Benitez. \"I'm really disappointed.\"\nThe visitors twice went close to equalising in the closing moments - Pope keeping out substitute Isaac Hayden, before Javier Manquillo's flicked header from Jonjo Shelvey's cross landed on the roof of the net.\nOn another Monday night to forget for the Magpies, Christian Atsu was guilty of wasting the best chance of the first half when he poked over from close range.\nNewcastle, who have failed to score in four of their 10 league games this season, have now lost 10 consecutive top-flight matches on a Monday.\nAsked what his side is missing, Benitez added: \"Be more precise on the ball and be more clinical. We made two or three crosses that were not the best when we were in a very good position.\n\"We have to carry on and improve.\"\nMan of the match - Jack Cork (Burnley)\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in Premier League action on Saturday.

He always gets himself in a good position and he understood what was required. He changed the game for us.\n\"It is important that you consistently pick up points. We won't win every game, we won't lose every game. It is about getting a steady return in terms of points. Every time you get a Premier League point you should celebrate.\"\nLeicester went ahead when Vicente Iborra lashed home from a corner and the Spaniard could have had a first-half hat-trick but had a close-range effort blocked and powered a header over the crossbar.\nFormer PFA Player of the Year Riyad Mahrez impressed throughout for the visitors and cut in from the left to drill home Leicester's second, before Crouch levelled.\nFoxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel made a string of saves to preserve a point, the best of which came from Kurt Zouma's header in the last minute of added time.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nA point to prove for Puel\nThe appointment of Puel received a largely underwhelming reaction from Leicester supporters as a result of Southampton being judged to have had a conservative style of play when he was in charge at St Mary's.\nHe guided the south coast club to eighth place in the league and a cup final, but ended his time at Saints with one goal in his final six games.\nBut the 56-year-old seems to have permitted his new charges a more free-flowing approach, allowing Algeria forward Mahrez and the spritely Demarai Gray to roam in the final third.\nGray, often a fringe player under previous Foxes managers Claudio Ranieri and Craig Shakespeare, has started both games under Puel and showed against Stoke how dangerous he can be with his pace and trickery.\nAfter requesting a transfer in the summer, Mahrez has also improved recently, delivering a goal or an assist in each of his past four league games and scoring on his 150th appearance for the club.\nMidfielder Iborra netted his first Leicester goal as Stoke failed to clear but the former Sevilla player - who was imposing in the middle of the park, winning the ball seven times - limped off with an ankle injury in the second half.\nLeicester ultimately had Schmeichel to thank for the point though, the Denmark keeper making five impressive saves including keeping out low drives from Shaqiri and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as well as efforts from defenders Zouma and Ryan Shawcross.\nPuel said: \"I am happy with the attitude of my players. It was a good game, good intensity and passion.\n\"We had a lot of chances today, it is difficult to accept one point, but Kasper saved well at the end so OK, we take a point. It is an encouraging game which is important for the future.\"\nSuper sub saves Stoke\nThe introduction of Crouch for winger Ramadan Sobhi signalled a more direct approach for the hosts - and it paid off.\nThe former England striker came on as a substitute for the 142nd time in the Premier League - equalling ex-Newcastle forward Shola Ameobi's record - and his goal was the 52nd time he has scored with his head, which extends his own record.\nOnly Jermain Defoe (23 goals) plus Nwankwo Kanu and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, both with 17, have scored more off the bench.\nCrouch said: \"It would be nice to be starting and scoring goals but that is the way things are going for me. So I have to come on and make an impact and try and get in the starting XI.\n\"It was an important point. In the last couple of weeks having Ryan Shawcross back has helped in defence - we have been dogged.\"\nStoke continued their sketchy start to the season and Mark Hughes' side have won just three times in the league so far, leaving them only four points above the relegation zone.\nEngland's Plan B?\nFormer Premier League goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on Final Score:\n\"I am not surprised at all that he is still going. He is 36 but still fit, looks after himself and is a great professional. He is a great character to have around the changing room and a fantastic option to bring off the bench.\n\"I think there is a case to say that he is a Plan B for England. Why can you not say that? Look at Euro 2016 against Iceland, there was no Plan B. Now what do England have as an alternative to playing football at the moment? They do not have very much.\n\"The closest is Andy Carroll but is he fitter than Crouch? That is the problem. Crouch would be more than happy just to be part of the squad and he has incredible experience and scores goals in the Premier League.\"\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Leicester)\nWhat next?\nThe international break is coming up so the sides are not in action for a couple of weeks. Stoke's next match is a trip to Brighton on Monday, 20 November (kick-off 20:00 GMT) while Leicester host Manchester City on Saturday, 18 November (15:00 GMT).\nPotter in the box - the stats\nThis is the third successive Premier League season this fixture has ended in a 2-2 draw.\nStoke City fielded an unchanged starting XI in a Premier League game for the first time since February 26, after 22 consecutive league matches where their line-up changed.\nDarren Fletcher has now appeared in 102 consecutive Premier League matches for his current and previous clubs (West Brom and Stoke combined) - the joint-fifth longest run by an outfield player in Premier League history.\nVicente Iborra scored his first goal in 16 league appearances since netting in La Liga for Sevilla against Athletic Bilbao in March.\nXherdan Shaqiri's goal was only the third (of nine in total) he has scored inside the box as a Premier League player - the last time he scored a league goal in the area was December 2015.\nShaqiri has now been involved in 21 Premier League goals (nine goals, 12 assists) - more than double the number of any other Swiss player (Ramon Vega had 10)."

Two weeks ago we beat Manchester United but the win today was another big moment for this club,\" said Wagner.\n\"It is the reality that we are in the Premier League now. If you know where we started two years ago, then this is something unbelievable, extraordinary.\"\nGerman defender Schindler was sent off after receiving a second yellow card in the 57th minute, but Albion could not use their numerical advantage to break the hosts down and find an equaliser.\nSubstitute Salomon Rondon headed their best chance inches wide of the left-hand post as Pulis saw his team extend their winless run to nine Premier League games.\nTerriers keeper Jonas Lossl produced acrobatic saves in injury time to deny James McClean and Matt Phillips.\nVictory moves the Premier League rookies up to 10th place, while Albion remain two points above the relegation zone in 15th.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nPerfect anniversary for Wagner\nWith Huddersfield still in buoyant mood after winning their last home game against Manchester United and West Brom in such poor form, this felt like a game from which the Terriers could take an important three points.\nWagner's side began as if they believed that too, dominating the first half in terms of possession and chances before Van La Parra's wonderful strike gave them a deserved lead at the break.\nBut Albion were unhappy they were not awarded a free-kick in the build-up to the goal, when Jay Rodriguez tangled with Town midfielder Jonathan Hogg.\nInstead referee Roger East gave the decision to Huddersfield, who moved the ball forward and ended up scoring through Van La Parra's crisp strike.\nThe complexion of the game predictably changed after Schindler's red card, the German receiving his second yellow for a clumsy late challenge on Ahmed Hegazi.\nBut any fears among Huddersfield fans that their team would be unable to preserve the lead proved unfounded.\nThe home side switched to a 5-3-1 formation and remained organised and resolute until Lossl came to the rescue to deny substitutes McClean and Phillips.\nWagner raced onto the pitch to hug his keeper at the final whistle as the home fans celebrated back-to-back home wins after the shock victory against Jose Mourinho's side last month.\nDefeat adds to Pulis pressure?\nWest Brom had only won two of their previous 19 Premier League games before their trip to West Yorkshire, a poor sequence of results that has Baggies boss Pulis in the spotlight.\nPulis has guided Albion to three mid-table finishes since taking over in January 2015, but those achievements have still not won over some sections of the Albion support.\nThey are unhappy with Pulis' methodical style of play and bemoan a lack of creativity in an Albion side that has scored just nine goals in their opening 11 Premier League matches.\nWhile it is thought Pulis retains the full backing of the Albion board, some fans would have looked on this fixture as a game the Welshman should win.\nHowever, they offered little threat as Pulis persevered with a 5-3-2 formation that contained three holding midfielders and lacked guile when in possession.\nAlbion mustered just one shot on target in the first half and, until the final few moments when they finally tested Lossl, they struggled to open up their 10-man opponents.\nIn truth they barely deserved a point after failing to impose themselves on the home side despite having an extra man.\n\"It hurts to go such a long time without winning a game,\" said Pulis. \"Things conspire against you sometimes and you don't get the breaks.\n\"I'm worried about the players more than anything else. I've been in this game too long to be affected by any criticism.\"\nMore post-match reaction\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner:\n\"Look how my players worked, what they left out there on the grass. It was an absolutely deserved win and I am delighted for my players because the workload was unbelievable. It was a great afternoon for us.\n\"We controlled the game up until the sending-off, dominating it. Then after the red card we defended really, really well and I am absolutely delighted.\n\"There was a long time left in the game at the point of the sending-off, more than half an hour, and my players responded by showing a real Terriers reaction.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis:\n\"It was a wonderful goal, an outstanding goal. You can't blame our keeper - it was a great strike. You can't fault my players, who have worked incredibly hard. But we are in the results business and these results mean there's some pressure on me.\n\"When they went down to 10 men there were times when we could have displayed a little more care in the final third. But we were beaten by a wonder goal when it should have been a free-kick given our way. And the crowd here is absolutely fantastic - it reminds me a little bit of Stoke City when we first got promoted.\"\nHome comforts for Huddersfield - the stats\nHuddersfield have won 11 points at home in the Premier League this season - only Arsenal (15), Manchester United (15) and Manchester City (13) have earned more\nDespite playing against 10 men for 33 minutes, West Brom (49.7%) still enjoyed less possession than Huddersfield (50.3%)\nWest Brom have lost all eight of the competitive matches in which they have conceded the first goal since May 2017\nThis is West Brom's lowest points tally after 11 games of a Premier League season (10) since 2005-06 (eight) - when they were relegated\nRajiv van La Parra's strike ended a run of 23 appearances in all competitions for Huddersfield without a goal\nWest Brom made a triple substitution in the match - this first time that has happened in the Premier League this season\nThis was the first red card Roger East has given in the Premier League since September 2016 - a period spanning 12 games\nMan of the match - Rajiv van La Parra (Huddersfield)\nWhat's next?\nThe international break means it is not until 18 November that Huddersfield travel to Bournemouth and Albion host defending champions Chelsea at The Hawthorns.\nFollow Match of the Day on Instagram\n, external\nfor the best photos from the world of football."

We were much better than them in all different aspects of the game apart from efficiency. They had one chance and scored. It is really painful for us, we did everything.

The responsibility is down to me, the staff and the players.\n\"We will continue to work hard. We need to find a way to work even harder. Time isn't running out as there are lots of games that need to be played so it's not a crisis but we need to start winning games.\n\"We might have to win ugly in order to get some results.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"We played very well. We knew it was going to be a tough game and we fought very hard for the win so I'm very pleased with what the boys produced.\n\"The thing with Glenn (Murray) is, he has a very good record of putting the ball in the net, which is what you need, but what I really like about him is his work ethic.\n\"He works hard on the training ground and then brings it to the pitch. But the boys all put a shift in today and I'm really pleased with the effort.\"\nMurray second to Kane - stats\nSwansea have managed just one clean sheet in their six Premier League games at the Liberty Stadium this season.\nThis is the first time Swansea have ever lost five of their first six home matches in the league.\nAfter failing to score in their first three Premier League games, Brighton have netted in seven of their past eight in the competition.\nSince the start of last season, Harry Kane (37) is the only English player to have scored more goals in the top two tiers of English football than Glenn Murray (27 - level with Tammy Abraham).\nThere were just 15 shots in this match - only four Premier League games have seen fewer this season.\nGlenn Murray has scored in three successive Premier League games for the first time since April 2015.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Swansea travel to Turf Moor to take on in-form Burnley on Saturday, 18 November (15:00 GMT).\nBrighton will look to make it five games unbeaten when they host Stoke City on Monday, 20 November."

That's 3-0, 3-0, 4-1, it's been a really good week.\"\nSalah put his side ahead in the first half, firing beyond keeper Joe Hart after the Hammers were caught out by a quick counter-attack.

The Hammers' points total of nine after 11 games matches their total over the same period in 2010-11 when they were relegated from the top flight.\n\"The pressure mounts game by game and at this moment it is big,\" Bilic said.\n\"We will see what the club will do.

Sadio is a naturally fit player, he is a machine.\"\nSalah the signing of the summer?\nThe opener was Salah's fifth goal in as many games for the club and the winger is proving to be worth every penny of the \u00a334m Liverpool paid Roma for his services in the summer.\nThe Egypt international's second of the game, a neat drive across Hart into the far corner, means he has now had a hand in 15 goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Liverpool player.\nThe win marked the first time since August that Liverpool had recorded back-to-back wins and maintaining that sort of consistency will be crucial to their hopes of finishing in the top four.\nIs there any hope for Bilic?\nIt has been a testing season for the West Ham manager, who on several occasions this season has reportedly been teetering on the brink of losing his job, only to oversee a result that relieved any immediate pressure.\nThe Hammers avoided a fourth successive Premier League defeat by beating Huddersfield 2-0 on 11 September and last month staged a stunning fightback to beat Tottenham 3-2 in the League Cup after trailing 2-0 at half-time.\nWest Ham were arguably the better side for the first 20 minutes against Liverpool but defensive naivety proved their downfall.\nDespite knowing the threat Mane and Salah posed on the counter, the hosts left just one defender back for the corner that led to Liverpool's first before Matip was left unchallenged to tap in a second barely two minutes later.\nAnd even the glimmer of hope offered by Lanzini's goal early in the second half was quickly snuffed out as a lapse of concentration allowed the visitors to score immediately from the restart.\nAgainst a side who had scored six goals in their previous two games and won 4-0 at London Stadium in May it was perhaps always going to be a tough task for the Hammers, but Bilic knows his situation is becoming increasingly precarious.\n\"I don't feel a broken man,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the situation for West Ham is not good and the club is above every individual.\n\"Of course I always believe in myself but it is not only about that now.\"\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah\nNo home comforts for West Ham - the stats\nLiverpool have scored eight goals in their two Premier League trips to London Stadium, the same tally as the Hammers have scored in their last nine there in the competition.\nSince moving to London Stadium in August 2016, West Ham have lost more games at their home stadium than they have won (W9 D4 L11).\nIn fact, since the move, only Swansea (44) have conceded more goals at home in the Premier League than West Ham (41).\nFor the 14th time under Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool have scored more than four goals in a single Premier League game - only Manchester City (16) and Tottenham Hotspur (16) have done so on more occasions in this period.\nMohamed Salah has scored or assisted nine goals in his first 11 Premier League games for Liverpool (seven goals, two assists); only Daniel Sturridge has been directly involved in more after 11 games (10).\nIndeed, no player has scored more goals after 11 Premier League games than the Egyptian (seven - level with team-mate Sturridge).\nSadio Mane assisted twice on his comeback from injury; no Liverpool player has been directly involved in more league goals since his debut in August 2016 (23 - 16 goals, seven assists).\nSince Dimitri Payet's departure in January, no player has been directly involved in more goals for West Ham in all competitions than Andre Ayew (16 - 10 goals, six assists); nine more than any other player.\nJoe Hart has conceded 33 goals in 18 Premier League games against Liverpool during his career; nine more than he has let in against any other side.\nWhat next?\nIt is the international break next with West Ham returning to action on Sunday, 19 November, when they travel to Watford (16:00 GMT).

I am very pleased with an important three points.\"\nArgentine Gazzaniga palmed away Scott Dann's header with a full-stretch save and also made fine stops to keep out Andros Townsend's low strike and Luka Milivojevic's point-blank header.\nA debut to remember\nTottenham were beaten by Manchester United in their previous league game, but have since won twice.\nThey had Gazzaniga to thank for the win over Palace as he excelled on his debut - Spurs were without both Lloris and Vorm for the first time since November 2013.\nHis last top-flight appearance in England came two years ago for Southampton - against Spurs, when he kept a clean sheet with a man-of-the-match performance.\n\"I knew last night that Michel Vorm was not too well so I started preparing then,\" said Gazzaniga. \"I was nervous for about three seconds and then the players gave me lots of support.\n\"I will take it step by step in trying to become number one for Spurs.\"\nHe did, though, show some understandable rust, his first act in a Spurs shirt seeing him clumsily collide with Palace defender Mamadou Sakho, though referee Kevin Friend saw no reason to award a penalty.\nWhen Gazzaniga sprinted off his line and was rounded by winger Zaha, he again escaped punishment as the Ivory Coast forward failed to find the open net with his angled shot.\nMixed reports on England men\nSpurs midfielder Dele Alli was ruled out before kick-off with the minor hamstring injury that caused him to withdraw from the England squad for friendlies against Germany and Brazil.\nNational boss Gareth Southgate has a further concern in the middle of the park after Alli's club-mate Harry Winks was replaced at half-time by Mousa Dembele having had treatment on a turned ankle.\nStriker Harry Kane, who went into the game with 17 goals in 17 games for club and country this season, also required attention following a heavy challenge by Timothy Fosu-Mensah.\nKane shot straight at Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni from a good position and along with full-back Danny Rose, making his first league start since January, headed off target from a promising position.\nAnother England man, Eric Dier, was one of Tottenham's better players though, making four perfect sliding tackles in the first half, attempting the most passes for his side (82) and making nine clearances.\nProblems for Palace continue\nPalace were organised, worked hard and kept Spurs out for an hour - but they have still only won once in the league all season and are four points adrift of safety.\nAs well as a porous defence that has conceded 22 goals in 11 games this season - the league's second-worst record - they are without a focal point in attack in the absence of Christian Benteke and have found the net just four times.\nFormer England manager Hodgson's return to the national stadium brought defeat, but he was encouraged by a lot of what his side produced against one of the country's leading sides.\nHodgson said: \"Spurs' goal was a painful blow. We knew they would dominate possession with the quality they have but we worked hard to restrict them and they didn't have many shots to worry us.\n\"We had quite a few moments of our own at the other end so it was a bitter blow to lose 1-0.\n\"We caused them a good deal of problems: Zaha's chance and others we could have scored. When you don't take your chances, you run the risk of them scoring at the other end and that's what happened.\n\"I am pleased with how we went about our business. I can't ask much more of what the players are giving. They are not lacking belief but when you are playing Tottenham away, you need a bit of luck and we did not get it.\"\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Spurs face north London rivals Arsenal away on Saturday, 18 November (kick-off 12:30 GMT), while Palace host fellow strugglers Everton on the same day (kick-off 15:00 GMT).\nSon surpasses Park - the stats\nAfter failing to win in their first three Premier League games at Wembley, Spurs have now won their past three in a row.\nPalace have failed to score in eight consecutive Premier League away games - only West Ham have had a longer away goalless run in the competition (nine in January 2007).\nPalace are only the second team to fail to score in their first six away games of a Premier League season, following Derby's eight in 2007-08.\nSon Heung-min's goal was his 20th in the Premier League, making him the highest goalscorer from Asia in the competition, surpassing ex-Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung on 19.\nPaulo Gazzaniga is the 15th goalkeeper to play for Spurs in the Premier League and the fourth not to concede a goal on his debut after Ian Walker, Hugo Lloris and Michel Vorm.\nFour points from their opening 11 games marks Crystal Palace's joint-worst start to a top-flight campaign - although they finished 11th the other time it happened in 2013-14."

The players gave an amazing performance.\"\nKevin de Bruyne's driven finish and a Sergio Aguero penalty put City in command and, even though substitute Alexandre Lacazette pulled one back for Arsenal, Gabriel Jesus sealed victory for the home side from close range.\nArsenal were aggrieved at the penalty awarded for Nacho Monreal's challenge on Raheem Sterling and both Jesus and David Silva appeared to be offside for the third goal, but the visitors did not deserve to take anything from the game.\n\"It is unfortunate that the game finished the way it finished,\" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. \"You can accept it if City win in a normal way, but this is unacceptable.\"\nStill, the Gunners would have been beaten by more had it not been for the saves of goalkeeper Petr Cech and the wastefulness of the hosts.\nCity go into the two-week international break with an extended advantage over second-placed Manchester United, who were beaten 1-0 at Chelsea.\nThe eight-point gap between the top two is the largest after 11 games in the Premier League era.\nArsenal slip to sixth, 12 points behind City, and face a battle to regain a place in the Champions League.\nFootball daily podcast: Can anyone stop Man City?\nRe-live Manchester City's victory over Arsenal and Manchester United's defeat by Chelsea\nReferees get worse every year - Wenger\nCity march on\nCity have now won 15 consecutive matches in all competitions, including an EFL Cup victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers on penalties.\nTheir 11-game haul of 31 points and +31 goal difference is a Premier League record, built on some breathtaking attacking play. This win was no different, even if they were hampered by their lack of ruthlessness in front of goal.\nCity were particularly dangerous on the counter-attack, their pace, movement and precision passing a constant threat. Just behind the front three of Aguero, Sterling and Leroy Sane, De Bruyne was the orchestrator.\nAguero and Sterling could have both scored before De Bruyne broke the deadlock, the Belgian playing a one-two with Fernandinho and angling the ball inside the far post via Cech's fingertips.\nMoyes is 'perfect' for West Ham - Neville\nCity could have been further ahead by the break, a Silva ball across goal should have been finished, while Sterling was unable to feed Sane when Arsenal were outnumbered at the back.\nOnly when Aguero converted a penalty off the post, early in the second half, was the result beyond doubt.\nThe visitors complained that Monreal's tangle with Sterling should not have penalised, but the Arsenal defender hauled down the England forward without winning the ball.\nSome sloppiness crept into City's play - home keeper Ederson almost dropped Alex Iwobi's long-range shot into his own net and they were carved open for Lacazette's goal.\nBut substitute Jesus' tap-in, fed by Silva from the right when both men could have been flagged offside, was no more than Guardiola's side deserved.\nArsenal left lagging behind\nIt was to Arsenal's credit that they did not capitulate - as they have done so often in the past - but this was a stark reminder of how far they lag behind the Premier League's top clubs.\nIn away league matches against the rest of the 'big six' since the start of the 2014-15 season, Wenger's side have won only once (a 2-0 win at City in January 2015), losing 10 and drawing seven.\nThough they started brightly, the Gunners were soon pushed back by wave after wave of City attacks, a central defensive trio that included Francis Coquelin continually stretched.\nGoing forward, they lacked the incision and creativity of their opponents. Alexis Sanchez, pursued by City in the summer, was tireless in his efforts as a lone striker, but an isolated figure.\nSanchez was preferred up front to Lacazatte, the \u00a346.5m pre-season arrival, and it was only when the France striker was introduced that Arsenal looked like taking anything from the game.\nThe visitors came down the inside-right channel, good work from Iwobi and Aaron Ramsey fed Lacazette, whose shot went through the legs of Ederson.\nEven then, though, the prospect of Arsenal earning a point seemed unlikely and they needed Cech to deny Jesus and De Bruyne before the third City goal made the scoreline a fair reflection of the game.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\n'It will be difficult to stop City' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"The only regret is the chances in the first half that we did not take, or when we didn't make the right pass. My wish is that the players come back healthy from the international break.\n\"We deserved to win it. We were so, so tired after the Champions League game and against Arsenal it is never won because they are able to make changes.\n\"We have 12 more points than Arsenal and Liverpool, eight more than Tottenham. That is a lot in November.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Can anyone stop them? With the way they have started and the quality they have it will be difficult, but you never know. If on top of that they have decisions like they have had today, they will be unstoppable.\n\"Sanchez did very well. He was up front on his own in the first half but did not have enough support. Overall, I think he has done everything. He is focused and wants to win. He put in a good performance.\n\"[Per] Mertesacker came in sick yesterday morning. [Fellow defender Rob] Holding had a thigh strain and [Mathieu] Debuchy has just come back from a long-term absence. I don't see that big problem for Coquelin to play in the middle of the two defenders or as the defensive midfielder.\"\nRecord-breaking City - the stats\nManchester City's 31 points and a +31 goal difference is the best start to a Premier League season after 11 games.\nArsenal have registered just one win away to the 'big six' in the Premier League since the start of 2014-15, drawing seven and losing 10.\nManchester City's haul of 52 goals is a record for a Premier League club after 17 games in all competitions (since 1992-93).\nCity midfielder Fernandinho has been directly involved in four goals in his last four Premier League appearances (two goals, two assists), as many as in his previous 64.\nSince the start of last season, Arsenal have conceded 12 goals from the penalty spot, more than any other Premier League side.\nCity forward Sergio Aguero has had a hand in 10 goals in his last five Premier League games (seven goals, three assists).\nPetr Cech has saved none of the 13 penalties he has faced with Arsenal in all competitions.\nCity forward Gabriel Jesus' rate of a goal every 89.6 minutes in the Premier League is the best record of any player to score more than 10 goals in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to Leicester on Saturday, 18 November, following the international break (15:00 GMT).

        "article_text": "Everton 3-2 Watford\nEverton held on to earn their first win under caretaker boss David Unsworth as Watford threw away a two-goal lead and Tom Cleverley missed an injury-time penalty for the visitors.\nIn a remarkable second half which lasted 58 minutes, Cleverley had the chance to snatch a point but put his weak spot-kick wide, handing Everton a first victory in five games.\nThe Hornets had taken a healthy lead thanks to goals from Richarlison and Christian Kabasele.\nBut they lost first-choice keeper Heurelho Gomes, who was taken off with a nasty head gash shortly before Kabasele's goal, and it proved to be the turning point.\nGomes' replacement Orestis Karnezis, on his Watford debut, was at fault for Everton's first when he came rushing out and Oumar Niasse darted past him and bundled the ball home.\nFrom the Toffees' first corner of the game, Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed home to equalise, and Leighton Baines scored the winner from the spot after Jose Holebas brought down Aaron Lennon.\nThere was 12 minutes of injury time after the stoppage for Gomes plus treatment for a Kabasele back problem, and Watford thought they had rescued a draw when Everton keeper Jordan Pickford brought down Richarlison, but it was not to be for Cleverley.\nReaction to Sunday's Premier League action\nMoyes is 'perfect' for West Ham - Neville\nUnsworth gets off the mark\nUnsworth has endured a torrid fortnight in caretaker charge of the senior team at Everton, with three defeats and two cup exits since stepping up from his job as under-23 coach.\nHis chances of the full-time job seemed to have evaporated after Thursday's 3-0 defeat in the Europa League by Lyon, and although Sunday's result may not make a difference to his future, it has stopped the rot for the Toffees and helped them climb out of the bottom three.\n\"Whatever will be will be,\" said Unsworth after the match. \"I have been the proudest man in the world to take charge for the last two weeks and no-one can take that away from me.\n\"I know nothing about it. I'm sure I'll speak to the chairman and owner and I'll keep giving my best for this wonderful club.\"\nWho will take charge of Everton now?\nIf Unsworth has not done enough to earn the Everton job, then who else is a candidate?\nSam Allardyce had been strongly linked with a return to management with the Toffees, but speaking during his stint as a pundit on Match of the Day\n, external\non Saturday, the former England, West Ham and Crystal Palace boss said: \"You never know, but I don't think so really.\"\nDavid Moyes has said he would be open to a return to Goodison Park, having spent 11 years in charge before leaving for Manchester United in 2013. However, the 54-year-old Scot has also been linked with West Ham, where Slaven Bilic's future is in doubt.\nSean Dyche had also been linked with the Toffees job, but the Burnley boss said two weeks ago that he had not been approached.\nEverton may well make their mind up during the two-week international break that has now started.\nWatford capitulate as their dip in form continues\nWatford failed to register a shot on target in a drab first half but they came out invigorated after the break.\nOnly 30 seconds after the restart, Toffees defender Michael Keane was dispossessed and Andre Gray set up Richarlison, who slotted home at the near post.\nAlthough Gomes' injury seemed serious, it looked as though Watford had not been affected by his loss as Kabasele netted their second with a powerful header from Holebas' corner.\nBut then they capitulated. Greece international Karnezis, who has only played four times this season, all for his country, was definitely at fault for the first goal, and should have done better for the second.\nAnd there is no doubt Cleverley's last-gasp penalty was wasted, as he scuffed wide against his former club, meaning Watford fell to a third consecutive league defeat.\n\"We were comfortable at 2-0. I didn't remember a period of 10 minutes when they had big pressure,\" said manager Marco Silva.\n\"The details made the difference. We made one mistake and they began to believe. Our player slipped for the penalty, and that's very unlucky.\"\nMan of the match - Leighton Baines\nEverton's comeback - the stats\nEverton came from two goals down to win at home in the Premier League for only the second time ever and for the first time since May 1994 against Wimbledon.\nWatford have lost each of their last three Premier League games, after losing just one of their previous eight under Marco Silva this season.\nRicharlison has been directly involved in six goals in the Premier League this season (four goals, two assists), more than any other Watford player.\nOumar Niasse has netted four goals in his four Premier League appearances at Goodison Park for Everton this season.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has had a hand in more goals in all competitions this term than any other Everton player (five goals, two assists).\nLeighton Baines has netted 19 Premier League penalties, the 10th biggest spot-kick haul of any player in the competition's history.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Everton travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday, 18 November (15:00 GMT) while Watford host West Ham the following day (16:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United\nAlvaro Morata scored his first goal since September as Chelsea deservedly beat Manchester United to move a point behind the Red Devils in the Premier League.\nMorata escaped the attentions of United's defenders to find yards of space and beat goalkeeper David de Gea from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross in the 55th minute.\nIt was another unproductive away day for United and manager Jose Mourinho after a goalless draw at Liverpool and loss to Huddersfield Town, leaving them eight points adrift of leaders Manchester City, who beat Arsenal 3-1 earlier in the day.\nUnited, with striker Romelu Lukaku subdued, only mounted serious pressure after Morata scored for Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford coming close twice and substitute Marouane Fellaini forcing a save from Thibaut Courtois.\nAnd, after the briefest of handshakes between the managers before kick-off, there was no repeat at the final whistle as Antonio Conte celebrated a crucial victory that will help to silence the noise surrounding his position as Chelsea manager.\nIt was Mourinho's third straight loss at Stamford Bridge since he became United manager.\nRelive Chelsea's win against Manchester United\nConte unsure on Luiz's Chelsea future\nFootball daily podcast: Can anyone stop Man City?\nConte revels in crucial win\nThe antipathy between Conte and Mourinho has been barely disguised, and the pair exchanged the most cursory of handshakes before kick-off.\nAnd a measure of just how much this win meant to Conte in both a footballing and personal context could be seen in just how fired up he was throughout.\nThe Italian was lectured by referee Anthony Taylor for his touchline antics, was seen brandishing an imaginary yellow card, and was almost bursting out of his coat in celebration at the final whistle.\nAfter striding on to the pitch at the full-time whistle to congratulate his players, he punched the air to all four sides of Stamford Bridge, then pumped his fist against his chest.\nConte's position at Chelsea has been the subject of much conjecture for most of this season, and he was clearly hurt by the manner of his side's Champions League defeat by Roma in midweek, but he got an instant response against United and his old adversary Mourinho.\nChelsea's win will hardly have leaders Manchester City breaking into a cold sweat, but this was a victory Conte desperately needed.\nAsked about the lack of a handshake with Mourinho at the end of the game, he told Sky Sports: \"It's not important. It's important to win the game.\n\"You have to have the respect on the pitch not outside the pitch.\"\nMorata outshines Lukaku\nMorata and Romelu Lukaku were central figures in a summer of transfer speculation as both Chelsea and United moved to strengthen their attacking resources with marquee signings.\nUnited felt they had pulled off a coup in signing Lukaku from Everton in a \u00a390m deal after supposedly long-standing interest from his former club Chelsea, while Conte insisted he had got the man he wanted all along when he completed a \u00a365m move for Morata.\nThere was only one winner here as Morata's movement, desire and match-winning goal meant he totally outshone the Belgian.\nLukaku has not scored in his past seven games and struggled to make any sort of impact as United slumped to a disappointing defeat.\nMorata, in contrast, led Chelsea's line with pace and energy and made the game's decisive contribution with a towering header after being given far too much space by the United defence.\nToo little too late for Mourinho and United\nThis was another disappointing return to Stamford Bridge for Mourinho, who lost 4-0 against his former club in the Premier League last season and was also on the wrong end of a 1-0 defeat in an FA Cup quarter-final.\nAnd, while it would be harsh to accuse Mourinho of parking the bus, it was yet another cautious performance from United until they went behind to that magnificent header from Morata.\nMourinho will have every right to question how Morata could find so much space around Eric Bailly, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones - but ultimately United left their push too late.\nFellaini was thrown on to add his usual mix of physicality and nuisance value, almost scoring with a scrambled shot that Courtois pushed away, while Rashford was narrowly off target with a snapshot and a free-kick.\nBut, yet again, there remains the lingering feeling United could have secured a more satisfactory result by adopting a bolder strategy - and this loss means Manchester City are now threatening to disappear into the distance.\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante\nWhat they said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte on Sky Sports: \"It's an important victory. When you play against Manchester United it's always a massive game. We know very well this team is very strong. This type of win is important for our confidence. We showed great desire and passion to win this kind of game.\n\"We can win or lose but our spirit must be this. Last season our spirit was in every game - we started this season with a lot of problems. We were up and down. This game showed if we want, we can.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"It was an even match. Both teams could win. The first to score would be in more defensive control and to win the match.\n\"The first half was really even. In the second half in the only period where they were on top of the game, they scored.\n\"It frustrates us to concede a goal in this situation. We lost ourselves after the goal emotionally. We found again the balance and desire in the last 15 to 20 minutes. It was all us. We had big chances to equalise but we couldn't.\"\nMorata heading the right way - stats\nThe Blues have lost just one of their past 16 Premier League home matches against Man Utd, winning 10 and drawing five.\nMorata has had a hand in 10 goals in his opening 10 Premier League games for Chelsea (7 goals, 3 assists) - only Diego Costa was involved in more in his first 10 for the club (11).\nMorata has scored 10 headed league goals since the start of last season - no player in the big five European leagues has scored more (level with Andrea Bellotti).\nAzpilicueta has assisted Morata five times in the Premier League this season, more than any player has assisted another in 2017-18 so far.\nAfter 20 shots on target and scoring seven goals in their first three away league games this season, the Red Devils have managed just six in their past three, scoring once.\nCesc Fabregas created six goalscoring opportunities in this match - no other Chelsea player provided more than one.\nThere are now eight points separating United in second and Manchester City in first - the biggest gap after both the top two have played 11 games in Premier League history.\nWhat next?\nChelsea's first game after the international break is at struggling West Brom on Saturday, 18 November (15:00 GMT) while Manchester United host Newcastle on the same day (17:30)"

The German defender also looked to have been offside.\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said: \"I do not need to say anything. It was obvious for everyone here and watching at home. It is not easy to accept because we lost the game but we have to move on and keep going.\n\"The free-kick for the first goal and the first goal was obvious offside, maybe the second was too. When you play against a team in the top six, the big details are up to you. Sometimes things go against you but that is football.\nWenger added: \"The free-kick was a free-kick for me. We have had bad luck away from home - I'll leave that to the specialists.\"\nArsenal's domination was underlined five minutes later when Sanchez finished emphatically at the near post, effectively securing the Gunners' first league win over Spurs since 2014.\nTottenham - who have only once in 12 league visits to the Emirates - suffered with Harry Kane, looking well short of match fitness after missing England's friendlies against Germany and Brazil with a hamstring injury, rarely threatening, although Arsenal keeper Petr Cech saved athletically from Eric Dier's late header.\nRelive Arsenal's victory over Tottenham\n'Arsenal fantastic, Spurs disappointing' - 5 live Football Daily podcast\nBig three deliver for Wenger\nWenger has mysteriously often decided against using Ozil, Lacazette and Sanchez as a potent three-pronged attack this season.\nThis was only the third time he has used the three players together and the combination's potential and threat was obvious as Spurs were outplayed for most of this north London derby.\nIt also begged the question why it was not used - with \u00a352m Lacazette the most obvious victim of Wenger's selection policy - in the 4-0 thrashing at Liverpool and the 3-1 loss at Manchester City earlier this season.\nThe France striker is already a popular figure among Arsenal fans, as proved by the fierce jeering when he was replace by Francis Coquelin with 17 minutes left, while Sanchez and Ozil have long been providing the attacking class for the Gunners.\nSanchez can be high maintenance and Ozil mercurial, but the three were at Spurs' throats from the start, providing fluidity and danger the visitors found almost impossible to control.\nLacazette and Sanchez were central figures in the crucial second goal, lashed into the roof of the net from an angle by the Chile international.\nAnd Ozil, the languid and elegant German, was full of energy and creation.\nThis outcome will surely have crystallised Wenger's thoughts on the matter - Arsenal are a much more complete and threatening proposition with the three together than without them.\nSpurs fall short again\nTottenham rightly received all the plaudits for a magnificent demolition of holders Real Madrid in the Champions League at Wembley - but a pattern is emerging that must be of concern to manager Pochettino.\nPochettino's side came up short in a hard-fought match at Manchester United last month - and were miles off the expected standard as they slumped to a loss they can have few complaints about at their arch-rivals on Saturday.\nSpurs' last win away at a fellow member of what might be termed the Premier League's 'big six' came with a 2-1 victory at Manchester City on 14 February 2016.\nThe Emirates has been a grim place for Tottenham to come to, with only one win in 12 visits with seven defeats - a statistic they never looked like changing here.\nThere was little doubt captain and main marksman Kane, who wore a large strapping on his right leg after missing England's friendlies against Germany and Brazil with a hamstring injury, was short of match fitness and Alli made no impact.\nPochettino's main worry will surely be that the drive, intensity and pressing he regards as a hallmark of the Spurs style all belonged to Arsenal on this occasion.\nYes, Tottenham can complain they were harshly dealt with for the first goal - but they were very much second best and this is something Pochettino will have to change if they are to make that elusive leap from runners-up to Premier League champions.\nDean the villain for Spurs\nThe appointment of Mike Dean as referee for this north London derby created much debate among Arsenal supporters, who feel they have been on the rough end of decisions from the official in the past.\nAnd some of Dean's early adjudications brought howls of outrage from Gunners fans - but in the end it was Spurs who were left complaining after a contentious decision led to the opening goal.\nDean punished Sanchez for what looked like a legitimate challenge, the resulting free-kick being headed past Lloris by Mustafi.\nArsenal boss Wenger was furious about the standard of officiating after the 3-1 loss at Manchester City on 6 November, saying after a third goal that replays showed was offside: \"I feel referees don't work enough. The level drops every season at the moment and overall it's unacceptable.\"\nOn this day, however, Pochettino was the manager with cause for complaint.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\n'Perfect performance from Arsenal'\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day:\nArsenal must frustrate the hell out of their own support. They can perform like they did today and should do it more often.\nI criticised them a few weeks ago for their performance against Manchester City but they were brilliant at their pressing game today. They got it perfect. Against City they went as ones and twos. Today they went as a team, put Tottenham under pressure and didn't let them play. It was a perfect performance from them. They were the better team.\nOzil has been criticised for not tracking back. Not today. He was man of the match.\nWe keep hearing about the potential of Tottenham and their manager but to be classed as a good team they have to win a trophy soon.\nFront three very good - Wenger\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told Sky Sports: \"It was an even game in terms of shots on target, off target, possession. I am only disappointed because the effort was massive from the team.\n\"It is obvious you saw what happened in the game and the small details were against us, it makes it difficult to win. I am very proud with the effort.\"\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger speaking to Match of the Day: \"I am very proud of the performance of my team. We played with purpose, desire and urgency and looked dangerous with a great solidarity.\n\"Mustafi was outstanding, the back three were outstanding. We threw our bodies in front of shots and were good on crosses. It was a terrific performance from Ozil - he has shown he is not only a great football player but can work and play for the team.

We had more chances before we scored and we needed to be patient in a lively way,\" said Klopp, whose side are fifth, a point behind Tottenham in fourth.\n\"The first goal - wow. I have nothing to do with the goal and the second was a fantastic pass and Mo Salah makes great runs. We could have scored more often but it was a perfect day for us.\"\nRelive the action from Anfield\nReaction from all the Premier League matches\n'Arsenal fantastic, Spurs disappointing' - 5 live Football Daily podcast\nSalah edges past Fowler\nSouthampton, a side perhaps carrying little confidence in their attacking ability given their return of just nine league goals this season, wilted after Salah curled in the opener.\nTadic's error was telling but the authority Salah exuded in the finish pointed once more to him being a player of the highest quality - and not the one Chelsea allowed to leave permanently for Roma after just 19 appearances.\nHis second, squeezed past Fraser Forster after a brilliant run on the blind side of his marker to collect Coutinho's outside-of-the-foot pass, took his haul to nine goals in his first 12 league games.\nThat tally is better than that of Reds legend Robbie Fowler, who managed eight goals in the same number of matches - a record which had stood as the best start any player had made to their Liverpool career in the Premier League.\nThe reception Salah got when he was replaced on 80 minutes summed up the depth of feeling the club's fans already have for him.\nNot just the Salah show\nThe understanding in Coutinho and Salah's link-up play will surely have pleased Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who allayed fears over his health this week after he was taken to hospital on Wednesday.\nHis side never looked like causing him stress against Saints and, prior to the opener, Georginio Wijnaldum had had a shot saved, while Coutinho had dragged a shot wide.\nPellegrino's side often dropped into a 4-5-1 shape without the ball and in doing so allowed Coutinho plenty of possession to orchestrate from deep. It meant his influence could not be limited and by half-time he had touched the ball 45 times.\nAdding to the dynamic was the fact this was the first time Coutinho, Firmino, Salah and Sadio Mane had started a game together this season and their threat occupied the visitors, who touched the ball just once in the Liverpool area during the opening half.\nAfter the break, Coutinho fired wide after again dribbling from deep and Firmino went close twice, once when denied by a timely Ryan Bertrand challenge and later when pulling a low shot inches wide.\nSalah will take the plaudits and rightly so but Coutinho, who is still linked with a move away, remains fundamental in injecting guile and tempo into attacks.\nHis finish from 12 yards was straight forward and he has now been directly involved in 14 goals in his last 15 league appearances for the Reds. It remains critical they keep hold of him.\nSaints remain blunt and vulnerable\nSouthampton, without influential defensive midfielder Mario Lemina through injury, never looked like threatening short of Bertrand going close with a free-kick when the score was 2-0 and a Charlie Austin header that flew over late on.\n\"We started well with energy, with shape and didn't give them too much space to create - but we made a couple of mistakes and it was really difficult for us to come back,\" said former Liverpool player and coach Pellegrino.\nPellegrino looks to have serious work to do as again his attack looked blunt. Shane Long - without a goal since February - did not manage a shot in his 79 minutes on the pitch.\nSaints left Merseyside without an effort on target, a flaw in their game which is becoming common and undoubtedly contributing to a run of just four wins in 20 league games.\nCould finally selling Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool offer funds to strengthen their attacking options? The central defender was solid if unspectacular at Anfield, making more clearances and interceptions than any other Saints player, while also boasting their best pass completion rate of 85%.\nBut there can be no doubt their problems are at the other end. Only twice this season have they managed to score two goals in a game and something will have to give if Pellegrino is to better the eighth-place finish Claude Puel achieved last season.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah\nWizard Coutinho - the key stats\nThe Reds have conceded just one goal in their past eight Premier League games at Anfield, keeping seven clean sheets in this run.\nSouthampton have scored only nine goals in the Premier League this term - their fewest after 12 games of a top-flight campaign since 1998-99 (also nine), when they finished 17th and avoided relegation by just five points.\nCoutinho (31) is now the player with the third-most assists for Liverpool in the Premier League, with only Steven Gerrard (92) and Steve McManaman (58) having made more.\nThe Saints failed to record a shot on target in a Premier League game for the first time since May, which also came in this fixture at Anfield (0-0).\nUp next?\nLiverpool travel to Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45 GMT kick-off) knowing a win would send them through to the knockout stage. They then host Chelsea in the Premier League next Saturday (17:30).\nSouthampton host Everton on Sunday, 26 November (13:30) and face Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea during their next six games."

19th and two points from safety - and have lost six of their past seven games.\nThey improved going forward following the introduction of Bony at half-time and although they had 13 shots, few could be regarded as clear-cut chances.\nThe Swans were also disorganised at the back which was summed up when a long goal-kick from Burnley's Pope made its way to Jeff Hendrick in behind defence before Fabianski rushed out to save.\n\"We had a bright start but when we conceded the first goal it affected our confidence,\" Clement said. \"Our confidence is clearly on a downward spiral.\n\"Burnley are very good at making you make errors and capitalising on them.\n\"As a side, we are playing under our potential and I have to find a way to break this cycle.\n\"We have to find a way to grind out a win and get the best out of our players.\"\nThe Welsh club's problems were further compounded when top scorer Tammy Abraham left the field on a stretcher in the second half.\nThe England striker seemed to be struggling with a back injury and had been treated for the issue earlier in the half before eventually being withdrawn.\nMan of the match -

the same total he registered in 32 appearances in 2016-17\nWhat's next?\nFew would have expected Burnley and Arsenal to be separated by only goal difference at this stage of the season, and the two sides will meet at Turf Moor on Sunday (14:00 GMT).\nSwansea return to the Liberty Stadium for their next game as they look to end their losing run when they play Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00)."

He is a serial winner who didn't win anything last year, so he wants to win everything this year.\"\nGuardiola actually spent most of the first half with his head in his hands as he watched Silva, Sane and Sterling fail to score despite a series of excellent chances.\nHe also witnessed his captain Vincent Kompany - returning for the first time since an August calf injury - scythe down Jamie Vardy in a clumsy challenge that drew a yellow card when Leicester's players were arguing for a red, as only Stones was in with a chance of covering his goalkeeper.\nShortly afterwards, Stones was forced off and replaced by Eliaquim Mangala after pulling up in pain, holding the back of his thigh having over-extended in a race for a long ball over the top.\nBut when the first goal finally came, Guardiola was purring. He appeared to mouth \"wow\", perhaps reacting to Sterling's delightful pass to Silva, maybe marvelling at Silva's composure in picking out Jesus, or more likely the sheer brutal and beautiful simplicity of the move as a whole.\nThis victory at the King Power stadium lifts unbeaten City onto 34 points, with a goal difference of plus-33.\nLeicester toothless, but unfortunate too?\nLast season's meeting between these sides saw Leicester run out 4-2 winners, Vardy scoring twice within the first 20 minutes.\nThe Foxes tried to match that high intensity opening on Saturday, but although there were several moments when City appeared unsettled at the back, the league leaders were seriously troubled only once.\nLeicester failed to produce a single shot on target, and suffered the ignominy of conceding the second goal on a counter-attack launched after Maguire only found the post following Ederson's unconvincing punch at Vardy's header across the box.\nJust 22 seconds later, De Bruyne had found the Leicester net with a left-footed hammer shot from outside the box. It was a stunning goal that sealed the home side's fate. From that point, City grew to their full potential and Claude Puel's side were thoroughly outplayed.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\n\"Kompany should have been sent off\"\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day:\nKompany should have been sent off and would have been if it was later in the game.

They can open you up at any opportunity.\n'The best in Europe' - what the managers said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The international break is always complicated, especially if you play away.\n\"It is complicated to defend against Leicester but we did really well. We did not concede one chance in 90 minutes. We missed the last pass, the last action but we arrive with lots of players attacking the back four. We continue with our good rhythm in terms of points and the way we play.\n\"Stones... we are going to miss him for a long time, we are going to suffer in that position for the future.

Gylfi Sigurdsson played in striker Oumar Niasse, who punished the error with a calm finish.\nThe Eagles should have capitalised on their second-half dominance but substitute Christian Benteke scuffed a golden opportunity wide with eight minutes left. He saw another decent effort saved by Jordan Pickford moments later.\nUnsworth said: \"That was a well-fought point. I am delighted with a point.\n\"We conceded two poor goals - our own downfall. To concede so early is always a blow but we came back strongly and this team has shown they have fight and desire.\"\n'Arsenal fantastic, Spurs disappointing' - 5 live Football Daily podcast\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nA point was not enough to lift Palace off the bottom of the table but they seem in far better shape than their shambolic early-season offerings.\nUnsworth, who continues to audition for the manager's job on a permanent basis, will be no surer of his fate after a mixed display from the visitors.\nThe 44-year-old, who won the FA Cup as an Everton player in 1995, said: \"As for me, I don't know. Tomorrow is a good day off then we'll see what happens on Monday.\"\nEverton and Palace have now conceded 24 goals in the league, clear evidence of their defensive problems.\nBut at least Palace, who sacked Frank de Boer after only five games of the campaign, have some clarity of leadership under Hodgson.\nThe former England manager employed a 4-4-2 formation which allowed the buoyant Loftus-Cheek, who impressed for England in the recent friendlies against Germany and Brazil, to get forward at will.\nLoftus-Cheek on a high\nLoftus-Cheek had a bad back before the game, but the sprightly 21-year-old midfielder will have walked tall off the rain-soaked pitch.\nHe was a constant menace, creating Palace's opener in the first minute and often making things happen with his surging runs.\nExperienced Everton left-back Baines had his hands full every time the Chelsea loanee bombed forward, and eventually the visitors resorted to fouling him.\nTom Davies, 19, was lucky to avoid a booking for scything down Loftus-Cheek, whose self-belief could be contagious.\nSometimes it just takes one player to make the difference and, with Loftus-Cheek firing, it takes some of the strain off Zaha.\nZaha has so often seemed Palace's only ray of light this season, and he reminded everyone why with his well-timed run to convert Joel Ward's 34th-minute cross.\nIf the pair of them keep this up, the Londoners have a fighting chance of pulling themselves away from danger.\n\"We really did boss the game, playing some excellent football,\" said Hodgson.\n\"We have dropped two more points. Mistakes happen, don't they? Being wise after the event doesn't serve any purpose at all.\n\"I thought Loftus-Cheek was very good today, as was the whole midfield. Our midfield controlled the game totally, and we used the ball very well.\n\"I can't ask for more than I got from the players today, but I must admit to being bitterly disappointed. It is not enough just to give players credit for a performance - as a manager I was to see some points on the board.\"\nEverton's muddled thinking\nEverton have made eight changes at half-time in their past 10 games.\nAdemola Lookman and Morgan Schneiderlin were replaced on Saturday, but it is a revolving cast of underwhelming players who are contributing to the Merseysiders' malaise.\nUnsworth has continued former boss Ronald Koeman's habit of trying to remedy the problems created by his starting XI after 45 minutes.\nHe mirrored Palace's 4-4-2 for the second half, although Dominic Calvert-Lewin's introduction was only denied an instant reward by a superb save from Palace keeper Julian Speroni.\nAlso in Unsworth's favour was his decision to stand by Niasse. The striker won a penalty and calmly converted for Everton's second equaliser, proving once again he can be an effective outlet for a side looking for any positives they can take.\nMan of the match - Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Crystal Palace)\n'Everton must sort manager situation out now'\nFormer Everton captain Phil Neville on BBC Match of the Day:\nEverton have bid \u00a310m for Marco Silva so it seems that's who they want.

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 0-4 Chelsea\nChelsea cruised to an easy away win over West Brom to increase the pressure on Baggies head coach Tony Pulis.\nAlvaro Morata scored his eighth Premier League goal of the season when he converted a rebound after Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster had parried Eden Hazard's low shot.\nHazard made it 2-0 shortly after when he collected Morata's flick and took the ball around Foster, before Marcos Alonso volleyed in a third from Cesc Fabregas' free-kick.\nIn the second half, Hazard scored his second of the game with a curled finish from 18 yards out after another excellent Fabregas pass.\nThe victory was Chelsea's fourth successive league win, while West Brom remain without a win in all competitions since 22 August, a run of 11 games.\nChelsea move up to third, behind Manchester United, who beat Newcastle in the late game, and leaders Manchester City, who won at Leicester.\nRelive Chelsea's win over West Brom as it happened\nAnalysis and reaction from Saturday's Premier League matches\n606: West Brom were 'terrible, spineless and pathetic'\nTough times for Pulis\nWith Chinese club owner Guochuan Lai at a Hawthorns match for the first time in six weeks, Albion fans booed their side off at half-time and again at the end as their side's miserable season continued.\nAlbion won their first three matches in all competitions, but have not won since and this result leaves them 17th in the table, only one point and one place above West Ham.\nPulis, who has been the Albion boss since January 2015, was asked earlier this week if he would be surprised if he lost his job.\nHe replied: \"No, not at all. If the club decide what they decide, I've got great respect for the football club, the supporters, the chairman, the board - it's just life. It's the way it is. If you don't get results, you're under pressure.\"\nBut his side were outplayed by the reigning champions, with Albion only producing two shots on target and never seriously testing away goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Substitute James McClean shot wide when through on goal late on for West Brom, who have only scored three times in their last five matches.\nPulis guided his side to 10th last season, their best finish in four years, but faces an uncertain future after another poor performance from his side.\nBig challenges ahead for Chelsea\nIt was a perfect start for Chelsea in a big week for them.\nOn Wednesday, they visit Azerbaijan to play Qarabag in the Champions League, knowing a win will secure their place in the last 16. With Chelsea in command at The Hawthorns, Conte was even able to give Fabregas, Hazard and N'Golo Kante a rest in the second half.\nThe damage was done in the opening 40 minutes with a ruthless Chelsea performance. Foster will feel he should have done better with the first goal as he could only push Hazard's shot into Morata's path, before the Spanish striker created the second with a sublime backheel flick that enabled Hazard to round the goalkeeper.\nPoor marking from Albion saw Alonso left unmarked to volley in a third from close range, before Hazard sealed the rout with a lovely finish for Chelsea's fourth.\nThe visitors, who are next in Premier League action next Saturday with an away game at fifth-placed Liverpool, could have won by a bigger margin, but Morata shot over.\n'I don't think Pulis can survive this' - analysis\nBBC Final Score pundits Garth Crooks and Martin Keown thought this could be Pulis's last match in charge of the Baggies.\nCrooks said: \"Tony Pulis looks a resigned figure on the touchline.\n\"At the moment, he does not seem to be able to offer anything to his team. The Baggies have been roundly beaten today, while Chelsea have played with a freedom and panache.\n\"Slaven Bilic cut such a forlorn figure towards the end of his time at West Ham, and that quickened his downfall. The same could be happening here to Pulis. The hatch on the trapdoor is opening.\n\"It would have been different if they had gone down fighting and lost only 1-0. But the Baggies owners were there watching today. Are they going to give supporters what they want, which would be a new manager?\"\nKeown added: \"I don't think Tony Pulis can survive this. Partly that's down to the brand of football - we are coming towards the end of his time at The Hawthorns.\n\"This sort of poor West Brom performance is game after game. The Baggies need a shot of creativity right through the club. Are the players being asked to play football by the management?\n\"This has been a long time coming, and this result and performance today is really going to test the resolve of the owner.\"\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nConte celebrates a Premier League landmark in style - stats\nWest Brom have lost 17 of their 22 Premier League games against Chelsea, their highest total against an opponent.\nThe Baggies have gone 10 league games without a win since mid-August and only earned 12 points from their past 21 fixtures (won two, drew six, lost 13).\nWest Brom's only league victory in 10 home matches spanning eight months was on the opening day of this season against Bournemouth (drew three, lost six).\nThis was Tony Pulis' joint heaviest home Premier League loss, matching his 4-0 defeats by Man City (October 2016) and Chelsea (January 2013, as Stoke boss).\nThis was Antonio Conte's 50th Premier League game in charge of Chelsea. The reigning champions have earned an unrivalled 118 points under him since the start of last season.\nChelsea have won 10 of their last 12 away games in the Premier League, losing twice.\n'I'll keep ploughing along if they want me to' - reaction\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis told BBC Sport: \"Our defending for all of the goals was really poor. Against the top teams, you have to defend better than that.\n\"It leaves me in the position I was in before the game. The board of directors will decide what they have to do. I have been in this position before. It's up to them. I feel for the players. They have worked hard but they have made basic mistakes.\n\"I spoke to the owners yesterday; they are really decent people. It's not about them, it's about what's best for the football club. That is more important than anybody. It's a decision they have to make. I'll keep ploughing along if they want me to do.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte told BBC Sport: \"Tony Pulis is a really good manager with great experience. He was the manager of many teams and his team is very difficult to face, always.\n\"The game became easy but it wasn't. From the start of the season, there has been a lot of pressure on us, never mind Tony Pulis. Every team has pressure. They are a good team and they can find the right solution.\n\"Morata and Hazard have a great link. They are now 100% fit. It is easy to forget that we started the season without Hazard.\"\nWhat's next?\nThings do not get any easier for West Brom as they play at Tottenham on Saturday, 25 November (15:00 GMT)\nChelsea face a long trip to Azerbaijan to play Qarabag in the Champions League on Wednesday (17:00 GMT). Antonio Conte's side are second in Group C and will qualify for the last 16 if they win. After that, Chelsea return to Premier League action on Saturday, 25 November at Liverpool (17:30 GMT)."

They started better, were organised and compact. Rafael Benitez is very intelligent and they created problems but we did well.\nThe result could have been a little bit bigger than it was.\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez:\n\"I am proud of my players because we knew that would be a difficult game.\n\"After conceding the first and especially the second goal, that made a huge difference.\n\"We took more risks after conceding the third, and we eventually conceded another. And that is hard, because we knew then we couldn't win and so retaining belief is quite hard.\n\"But the reality is that for 30 minutes, we played well against top-class players.\"\nMore Old Trafford woe for Benitez\nThis was Rafael Benitez's heaviest defeat as a Premier League manager since March 2008, when his Liverpool side lost 3-0 at Old Trafford.\nManchester United have now won seven consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford; their longest run since March 2013, when they won 12 in succession under Sir Alex Ferguson.\nDwight Gayle's goal was the first that Manchester United have conceded from open play at Old Trafford in the Premier League since New Year's Eve 2016 - 21 hours and 37 minutes ago.\nPaul Pogba, who provided the assist for Martial, has been directly involved in eight goals in his last six Premier League appearances (four goals and four assists).\nNewcastle have now lost to Manchester United on 26 occasions in the Premier League; more than against any other opponent in the competition.\nManchester United extended their unbeaten run at Old Trafford in the Premier League to 23 games (won 13, drew 10); their longest streak since October 2011 (a run of 25).\nAnthony Martial has scored five goals in 11 Premier League appearances this season, one more than he managed in 25 games last term.\nNo player has scored more goals at home than Romelu Lukaku in the Premier League this season (five - joint-high alongside Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sane).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United turn their attention to the Champions League.

        "article_text": "Watford 2-0 West Ham United\nDavid Moyes said he was disappointed with West Ham's \"big players with big reputations\" after his first game in charge ended in a 2-0 defeat at Watford.\nThe Scot's hopes of a winning start in his 500th Premier League game as a manager were dashed by goals in either half from Will Hughes and Richarlison that left his new club in the bottom three and the size of the task facing him even clearer.\nFor the hosts, it was another energetic and clinical performance that highlighted why coach Marco Silva is coveted by Everton.\nMoyes, appointed as Slaven Bilic's successor on 7 November, can feel aggrieved at an unpunished handball in the build-up to Richarlison's strike, and lost \u00a325m striker Marko Arnautovic with a suspected broken thumb in the second half.\nHe will have to build on an improved second-half spell by the Hammers, who were spectacularly denied by Watford keeper Heurelho Gomes.\nAnalysis: Moyes will now realise the size of his task\nMoyes, 54, said: \"I always thought this was a big job. Some big players with big reputations disappointed me a lot.\n\"I thought they would show me more. They need to show me why they have got that reputation.\n\"I don't enjoy the performance and I expected us to do better. We tried to stay in the game and give ourselves a chance - and we probably did - but overall it was not good enough.\"\n5 live's Football Daily podcast: Moyes 'really disappointed with performance'\nIt was an impressive return to winning ways for the Hornets, whose early-season momentum had stalled with defeats in their previous three games, and the victory moves them up a place to eighth in the table.\nHughes, the 22-year-old \u00a38m summer signing from Derby County, scored with his first attempt on goal in the top flight, latching on to Andre Gray's scuffed effort and smashing it past Joe Hart.\nThe England goalkeeper was also beaten by Richarlison, who was a constant threat, but did well to stop Adrian Mariappa's header to deny Watford a third after an hour.\nWhat next for Silva?\nWatford fans, not to mention Evertonians, will be keen to see whether Portuguese Silva pushes for a move to Goodison Park.\nThe money on offer from the Toffees' billionaire owner Farhad Moshiri may turn his head, but it would not be an easy decision to walk out on this promising squad, balanced with youth and experience and fuelled by shrewd recruitment.\n\"What I can control and what is in my hands is the next training session and we will be back in tomorrow,\" Silva said.\n\"I know the speculation and people ask questions of our commitment, but me and my players gave a very good answer about our commitment.\n\"This type of interest in players and coaches happens but it's not fair to question our commitment.\n\"I'm not going to talk about that situation any more.\"\nFor Watford supporters concerned at the prospect of Silva leaving, there is some consolation: the scouting team that identified Richarlison from Fluminense in Brazil and decided to take a chance on Hughes, long-linked with a move to the top flight, will remain regardless of who sits in the dugout.\nBoth players caught the eye against West Ham, who invested on more tested Premier League talent in Hart, Pablo Zabaleta and Arnautovic in the summer but are nine places below Watford in the table.\nUnder former Italy international Andrea Carnevale, the Hornets have one of club football's most envied scouting units, and owner Gino Pozzo has an equally sharp eye for managerial appointments.\nLosing Silva after only 13 games in charge would hurt, but it should not derail one of the league's most impressively run clubs competing with those with far bigger budgets.\nWe need a united club - Moyes\nMoyes is no stranger to clubs afflicted by unrest and ill feeling; during his Everton and Sunderland reigns, fans protested against the boards.\nOn Sunday, some West Ham supporters brought banners demanding that owners David Sullivan and David Gold leave.\nMoyes' appointment has not exactly thrilled them either,\n, external\nyet those prepared to give him a chance will have gleaned tangible improvements, even if the result was still miserable.\nArnautovic, so far mistrusted by West Ham fans and still without a goal, appears to be ready to absorb Moyes' statutory demand for hard work.\nThe Austrian made 44 sprints at Vicarage Road, the second highest of any Hammer, and was denied only by Gomes' remarkable double save.\nIf Moyes can lift the spirits of previously influential players such as Mark Noble - the veteran's smart pass to Cheikhou Kouyate should have brought a second-half goal - it will help.\nThe chances West Ham created suggest they can pull away from danger. But restoring fragile belief is one of Moyes' more urgent tasks.\n\"I don't know the history and the reasons for that,\" said Moyes of the atmosphere in the away end at the final whistle.\n\"I thought they were supportive of me and I'm thankful for that. But we need them now. We need a united club.\n\"I told the players it's tough to play in front of a crowd like that but a goal would make the fans feel better.\"\nMan of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure\nWhat next?\nWest Ham host Leicester City on Friday (20:00 GMT) Moyes' first home match in charge, while Watford travel to Newcastle United on Saturday (15:00).\nDay of happy firsts for Hughes - the key stats\nWill Hughes scored with his first shot in Premier League football, in his third game\nHughes scored and assisted in a league game for the first time\nOnly in 2010-11 had West Ham accrued fewer points (8) after their first 12 games of a Premier League campaign than this season (9)\nThe Hammers have conceded 25 goals in their first 12 league games this season, their joint highest at this stage of a Premier League campaign (level with 2001-02)\nDavid Moyes became the fourth manager to manage 500 Premier League games, after Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger and Harry Redknapp\nAndre Gray has registered two assists in his past two Premier League games, as many as in his previous 40\nRicharlison has been directly involved in seven Premier League goals this season (5 goals, 2 assists), three more than any other Watford player; his strike against West Ham was his first goal at Vicarage Road"

The draw was a fair result. Our levels weren't perhaps what they've been in other games.\n\"We are going to concede goals - the frustration with their second is we worked hard to get back into the game and showed some naivety.\"\nOn his side's penalty appeal: \"It was a definite penalty. I was certain it would be given, if not by the referee then the linesman on that side.\n\"When video replays come in, it will clear up some of these instances. At the moment, you're relying on the referee making a judgement or getting into a position - and if that's not the case you have two assistants and a fourth official to help. I find it difficult to understand the assistant doesn't see it the same way I do.\"\nStoke City boss Mark Hughes: \"As an away side, I suppose we have to be happy but we got ourselves into a winning position twice and didn't see it out. Brighton didn't cause us too many problems. We're disappointed with the goals we conceded.\n\"One of our things tonight was we created good opportunities in good areas and then you have to produce the quality ball.\"\nCrouch comes off the bench, for 143rd time - the stats\nPeter Crouch became the most used substitute in the Premier League with his 143rd appearance off the bench putting him one ahead of Shola Ameobi.\nPascal Gross has been directly involved in 62% of Brighton's 13 Premier League goals this season, scoring three and assisting five.\nKurt Zouma's goal was Stoke's sixth from a corner this season, more than any other Premier League side.\nDarren Fletcher made his 326th appearance in the Premier League, which is more than any other Scottish player in the competition.\nFletcher was also playing in his 103rd consecutive match in the top flight, giving him the fifth longest run for an outfield player.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Stoke visit Crystal Palace at the same time."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-0 Brighton & Hove Albion\nManager Jose Mourinho said Brighton provided his Manchester United side with \"probably the hardest match we've had this season\" after a narrow win for the hosts at Old Trafford.\nAn unfortunate Lewis Dunk own goal was enough to earn United an 11th straight home win and cut Manchester City's lead at the top to five points ahead of their game at Huddersfield on Sunday.\nBrighton had been the better team up until Ashley Young's attempt from the edge of the area hit Dunk and looped over keeper Mat Ryan into the net.\nEarlier, Anthony Knockaert and Pascal Gross both went close after getting behind the United defence.\n'Brighton deserve more than the result they got'\n\"Honestly, I think Brighton were very good,\" said Mourinho.\n\"I want to be honest and give them what they deserve, for me probably they deserve more than the result they got.\n\"They played really well, they had a good defensive organisation and then when they had the ball they were dangerous.\n\"They gave us probably the hardest match we've had this season.\"\nRyan produced a double save to keep out Romelu Lukaku's header and Paul Pogba's follow-up on the stroke of half-time.\nYet Brighton, who remain ninth in the table, were more than a match for United.\n\"In a tight affair we were good value and I'm really disappointed not to come away with anything,\" said Seagulls boss Chris Hughton.\n\"We looked to get into that final third as often as we could. I thought we were very brave on the ball.\"\nReaction from today's Premier League games\nRelive Manchester United's win over Brighton\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nDortmund throw away four-goal lead - and have Aubameyang sent off\nSlice of fortune seals it for United\nMourinho offered Hughton a hug at the final whistle - the Red Devils boss clearly relieved to have won a match despite a far from vintage display.\nIt required a huge slice of luck to finally breach the Seagulls defence in a scrappy game as Dunk, who also scored an own goal against Manchester City in August, become the first player in Premier League history to score past his own keeper against both Manchester clubs in the same season.\nYoung, who has not scored since May 2016, celebrated wildly. The dubious goals panel could yet rule in the former Aston Villa's player's favour.\nUnited are now unbeaten at Old Trafford in 39 league and cup games - their last home defeat coming against Manchester City on 10 September 2016.\nCity are the next Premier League visitors to Old Trafford on 10 December and Mourinho knows his side will have to produce a better performance than this to beat their title rivals.\nLukaku looked flat throughout and now has one goal in his past 10 games while Paul Pogba was unable to have as much influence as he enjoyed the previous week against Newcastle.\nThis will go down as an ugly win but Mourinho and his players will not care if they are top of the table next May.\nPositives for Hughton in defeat\nBrighton failed to win any of their first three league games during a tough introduction to Premier League life.\nYet they showed on their first league visit to Old Trafford since 1983 that they have adapted to this level.\nHaving lost 2-0 earlier in the season to both Manchester City and Arsenal, the Seagulls will treat this latest defeat against one of the big Premier League heavyweights as another lesson in their first season at this level for 34 years.\nThey were well organised, hard working and deserved something from the game.\nGross was a constant menace while Bruno caused problems with his pace.\nEven when United did get behind Brighton's defence, they found Ryan in fine form - his double save at the end of the first half added to the home team's frustration.\n\"We've played three of the big six and we play Liverpool next Saturday,\" added Hughton. \"We haven't been humiliated in any of them. That will go some way with confidence in the changing room.\"\nMan of the match - Pascal Gross (Brighton)\nClean sheet kings - the stats\nUnited have conceded just six goals this season, their lowest total after the first 13 league games of the season since 2007-08.\nJose Mourinho's side have recorded a clean sheet in 26 of their 51 Premier League matches since the start of 2016-17 - more than any other side.\nAnthony Martial has scored just one goal in his five Premier League starts this season, compared to netting four goals and making two assists in seven sub apps.\nWhat's next?\nA midweek trip to Watford is next up for Manchester United. They face the Hornets at Vicarage Road in the league on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), the same night as Brighton host Crystal Palace (19:45 GMT)."

They had a couple of runs down their left which were difficult to control. We were pushing in the first half, we were on top for a while but then didn't score.\n\"We have to realise where we are, what we have and where we want to be. I've said before it is going to be a tough season and we have to keep working as hard as possible.\"\nWatford boss Marco Silva: \"We won the game, really important for us, we got a fantastic result.\n\"We deserved the three points. We had very good moments, we scored the first goal through something we planned. The confidence in some moments was good, we knew they were strong in the long balls and first and second balls and I think we controlled really well.\n\"It is important for our players to play with this confidence. It is important for them to rest now and we have a hard game against Manchester United on Tuesday.\"\nMan of the match - Marvin Zeegelaar\nHornets buzzing on the road - the stats\nWatford have won more away Premier League points in their seven games this season (13) than they did in 19 on the road in 2016-17 (12).\nThis was also Watford's biggest away win in the Premier League, and their biggest on the road in the top flight since a 5-1 victory vs Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in May 1986.\nWill Hughes has scored in back-to-back league games for the first time in his career.\nNo player has been involved in more away goals in the Premier League this season than Richarlison (four goals, three assists).\n21 points from 13 games marks Watford's joint-best ever start to a top-flight season, equalling the number set in their first ever such campaign in 1982-83, when they finished second.\nNewcastle have never won a Premier League game in which they've been two or more goals behind at half-time, drawing three and losing 64.\nThis is only the second time that Rafael Benitez has suffered back-to-back home defeats in the Premier League as manager, with the other occasion coming with Liverpool in January 2005 (vs Chelsea and Manchester United).\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are in action again on Tuesday, 28 November - Newcastle travel to West Brom, while Watford will host Manchester United.

But it's not good enough.\"\nRelive Spurs' draw with West Brom\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nDortmund throw away four-goal lead - and have Aubameyang sent off\nKane's equaliser denied the away side a first victory in any competition since August and they are now 12 games without a win, a point ahead of 18th-placed West Ham.\nThe match came six days after West Brom sacked manager Tony Pulis, with his former assistant Gary Megson in temporary charge and Alan Pardew favourite for the job.\nFormer Bolton boss Megson had not managed a Premier League team since 2009.\nHe told Match of the Day: \"The players are in tomorrow, but whatever else goes on is nothing to do with me.\"\nBaggies show fighting spirit\nMegson said during his pre-match interview that he was \"not Tony Pulis with ginger hair\".\nHis team produced a performance not far removed from the Pulis era, and the spirit they showed will encourage the incoming manager.\nMegson made only two changes to the side that lost 4-0 at Chelsea last weekend, with Sam Field and Allan Nyom replacing Grzegorz Krychowiak and Gareth McAuley.\nAfter snatching the early lead, they were content to sit back and restricted Spurs to just two shots on target in the first half.\nFoster frustrated the hosts by slowing the game down at every opportunity, and he was eventually booked by referee Mike Jones in the 82nd minute.\nIn front of him, captain Jonny Evans epitomised a disciplined defensive performance, marshalling his backline alongside Ahmed Hegazi and Nyom.\nIt was therefore unfortunate that Evans' one lapse in concentration let Kane in for the equaliser as the West Brom defence was finally breached.\nThe Baggies struggled at the other end - having just six touches in the Spurs box - though Rondon did have a chance to nick a win at the end.\nSpurs' Premier League blip continues\nTottenham looked tired after their midweek win at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League, and they switched off for West Brom's opener.\nThe Londoners had 72.6% possession in the game, but failed to carve out many clear-cut chances.\nA lack of willing runners hindered their attacks in the first half, with Son Heung-min their only real threat. Kieran Trippier put in cross after cross, but could not find Kane.\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino took something of a gamble early in the second half, sending on midfielder Mousa Dembele and striker Fernando Llorente for midfielder Harry Winks and centre-back Jan Vertonghen.\nThe change certainly gave Spurs' more attacking impetus, and their equaliser - when it came - was deserved.\nBut they have gone off the boil in domestic competition, winning just one of their past four league games.\nMan of the match - Jonny Evans\nBoth managers left disappointed\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I think we are disappointed because the effort from us was massive but we conceded the goal so early in the game, and they had the belief to play deep, so it was hard for us to move the ball.\n\"In the last 15 minutes we increased our level and created a lot of chances to score but we weren't clinical. It is always difficult in the Premier League when you concede a goal so early, it changes the way the team wants to play.\n\"I'm disappointed because we lose two points. Now, we need to look forward now and try to win the next game.\"\nWest Brom caretaker manager Gary Megson, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Having led for so long it was disappointing to concede the manner of the goal we did, whoever we're playing against - a team as good as Spurs or whoever.\n\"They've had a lot of possession, but not many clear chances, so we defended really well actually, apart from their goal. In terms of the week we've had, the performance we've put in and the energy the players had - I'm really happy with them, they can be really pleased with their efforts.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom host 13th-placed Newcastle in the league on Tuesday (20:00 GMT), while Tottenham travel to 11th-placed Leicester (19:45 GMT).\nStats - Kane's goalscoring feats continue\nKane has been involved in 100 Premier League goals in his 128 games - 87 goals and 13 assists.\nKane has scored 47 goals in 45 appearances in all competitions for club and country in 2017.\nFour of the last five Premier League games between these two sides has been drawn. Of all Premier League fixtures to have been played at least 20 times, only Everton v Leicester (56.5%) has been drawn a larger percentage of the time than Tottenham v West Brom (47.8%).\nSpurs have dropped as many points in their first seven Premier League games at Wembley this season than in their previous 23 league games at White Hart Lane (nine points dropped).\nTottenham have conceded in four of their last five Premier League games, this after recording four clean sheets in their previous five.\nWest Brom have kept just two clean sheets in their last 25 Premier League away games."

It's important we responded and the equaliser was important for us. Then it was what was going to happen next. \"\nXherdan Shaqiri's fine solo goal had lit up a subdued encounter and put the visitors in front on 53 minutes.\nBut Palace were level within two minutes through Ruben Loftus-Cheek, the England international taking advantage of lax defending to convert at the far post.\nThe visitors may well feel aggrieved having come so close to what would have been a deserved point.\nFor Hodgson, though, it is now eight points won since he replaced Frank de Boer in September.\nIt was a triumph of persistence for the former England manager's team, who are now gathering momentum before games against Brighton, West Brom and Bournemouth.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nDortmund throw away four-goal lead - and have Aubameyang sent off\nNo place like home\nThis game came at the end of a week during which Palace chairman Steve Parish announced\n, external\nplans for a new stadium are moving quickly.\nThe club have been exploring options for leaving Selhurst Park for years, and Parish said he would reveal more before Christmas.\nBut he would be wise to think hard about how to retain some of the renowned atmosphere their current home generates on days like this.\nThe Eagles were not playing especially well and seemed destined for a point, but the home fans remained noisily behind them despite their difficult start to the season.\nIt meant Palace were able to keep cranking up the pressure on a jittery Stoke, and eventually capitalise on their late lapse.\nParish need only look at the problems faced by West Ham after swapping Upton Park for London Stadium, and ensure his side keep some of that Selhurst alchemy.\nSuper Shaq needs help\nShaqiri is the type of attacking player who can light up any game.\nHis third goal of the season proved that - the Switzerland international carrying the ball from almost the halfway line, sashaying past Palace defenders and finishing expertly.\nBut Stoke rely on him too heavily - he had five of only nine shots in total from the visitors.\nManager Mark Hughes believed Shaqiri's goal should have at least earned them a point, and blamed poor defending for their defeat.\nBut he must address his team's issues at the other end of the field, and find more support for Shaqiri.\nMan of the match - Yohan Cabaye (Crystal Palace)\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson told Match of the Day: \"It was an even contest and we've played better before. We got a bit of good fortune with the Sakho goal.\n\"Our fans cheered us on and they do stay to the end unlike fans at a lot of other clubs. I think that's something that will be a major weapon for us.\n\"If you fight to the end you've always got a chance and we showed fighting spirit.\"\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes told Match of the Day: \"We've defended poorly in the last few games unfortunately and it was the same again.\n\"We had two at the far post which we should have dealt with.

Clement is as short as even money with some bookies to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job.\nSwansea's home form has been their biggest issue by far this term and the performances in their losses to Newcastle, Watford, Leicester and Brighton have left many at the Liberty Stadium openly questioning the coach who kept them up, against the odds, last season.\nClement's team selection was nothing if not bold, with summer signing Roque Mesa earning a surprise start, his second of the campaign and first since 19 August.\nHowever, his players barely produced a response to keep the critics at bay, with the Swans not so much as sniffing a tangible chance until the stroke of half-time.\nThe hosts enjoyed plenty of possession, but it was the visitors who had the better opportunities.\nThat was until Swansea had a goal disallowed after 44 minutes when Renato Sanches found space inside the visitors' area and his attempt at a shot cannoned into the air, falling for Bony, who smashed the ball beyond Asmir Begovic.\nHowever, referee Stuart Attwell adjudged Jordan Ayew to have fouled Nathan Ake in the build-up, meaning the teams exited the field to a chorus of boos; largely directed at the officials. The fact the shot at goal was Bony's only touch in the first period in Bournemouth's half of the field tells its own story.\nThe Swans improved after the break with Sanches and Bony linking well. However, clear chances were few and far between despite Swansea spending almost 40% of the contest in Bournemouth's final third.\nBournemouth's signs of revival continue\nThe Cherries headed into this game buoyed by the knowledge that their form is comfortably their best in recent months, with Eddie Howe's side having won three of their previous four games, collecting as many points in that time as they had in their previous 11 in the Premier League.\nHowe's men had never lost to the Swans in the top division, with their last defeat against the Welsh side coming in 2006, in League One.\nThey seemed to have the edge when it came to confidence and, but for decent goalkeeping, they might have led before half-time.\nJoshua King's fine run and cross presented Marc Pugh with a chance after only 90 seconds, but he shot tamely before Andrew Surman's curling effort was also dealt with by Lukasz Fabianski.\nThe Polish goalkeeper was forced to make a splendid stop after 43 minutes when Pugh crossed and King stabbed an effort at goal which the shot-stopper tipped to safety.\nBournemouth were composed and compact as they chased an unprecedented third successive Premier League clean sheet, but they struggled for rhythm early in the second half as the hosts huffed and puffed without looking like making a breakthrough.\nHowever, with seven minutes remaining substitute Fer burst through and forced Begovic to save low with his legs, the rebound fell back to Fer but he could only clip the crossbar.\nAnother sub, Tammy Abraham, saw a claim for a penalty waved away in stoppage time, while Charlie Daniels went close for the visitors but dragged his shot just wide.\n'Patient supporters a big help' - what they said\nSwansea City manager Paul Clement:\n\"[It was] not a very good performance from him [referee Stuart Attwell], but I'd rather talk about my team.\n\"They showed the passion and enthusiasm today and I think the supporters were happy with what they saw.\n\"Leroy Fer has a really good chance at the end, but it's a pleasing performance. We were really good in spells and it is something to build on.\n\"The way we played after the break was settled and in control. We didn't get that break to get all three points, but the fans were patient when we made errors and that was a big, big help.\"\nOn Bony's disallowed goal: \"I thought at the time it was soft foul to give [against Ayew].\n\"I think if that was between the two boxes the game would have carried on. That's what I saw in real time and I made that point to the referee at half-time, that it was a soft decision.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe:\n\"It was a scrappy game and not high quality, but both team gave everything.\n\"We're becoming harder to beat, so I'm happy [with that]. They made it difficult for us.\"\nOn Swansea's disallowed goal in the first-half: \"I thought there was a foul, [but] I've only seen it live. I thought the referee made the right call.\"\nOn a record third consecutive clean sheet in the Premier League: \"I'm very pleased with that mark. As a team we've functioned well this season but there are plenty of areas to improve.\n\"I think it's another step forward for us, we didn't play well but came away with a point. We look forward to Wednesday.\"\nMan of the match - Nathan Ake (Bournemouth)\nBony's barren run continues - the stats\nThe Swans stopped a run of four consecutive losses in the league, however, they are without a win in their last five (D1 L4), their longest winless run since April 2017 (six).\nThe Cherries have kept three successive Premier League clean sheets for the first time.\nIn fact, it was the first time Bournemouth had kept three consecutive shutouts in any league since October 2014.\nSwansea have failed to score in three successive Premier League games for the first time since May 2013.\nThe Swans recorded just one shot on target against Bournemouth, with the Swans having just 24 shots on target in the Premier League this season; 10 fewer than any other side.\nWilfried Bony has now gone nine Premier League games in a row without a goal. The Ivorian striker has only netted in one of his last 27 Premier League games (2 goals).\nWhat's next?\nSwansea will look to arrest their winless run when they visit reigning Premier League champions Chelsea on Wednesday, 29 November (19:45 GMT); on the same night Bournemouth host Sean Dyche's Burnley at the Vitality Stadium (also 19:45 GMT)."

We didn't want to time waste, we wanted to change the system and that's why I was angry.\"\nThe goal denied Mohamed Salah a dream outcome against his former club after the Liverpool winger had opened the scoring just after the hour with a close-range finish.\nThat was Salah's 10th goal in just 13 Premier League games this season in what has been a superb start to the Egyptian's Liverpool career.\nSalah could even have won it for Liverpool in the final minute but his powerful drive was saved by Thibaut Courtois.\nChelsea are unbeaten in their past seven visits to Anfield, a run stretching back to 2013.\nPodcast: Chelsea deserved to win - Conte\nVote: Salah or Hazard - who's having the best season?\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nMan Utd scrape past Brighton\nSensational Salah unlucky not to have final say\nSalah, understandably, was the centre of attention in the build up to the match as he faced his former side for the first time since leaving Chelsea for Roma in the summer of 2016.\nThe 25-year-old made just 17 appearances and six league starts during his two-year spell at Stamford Bridge but has returned to England a much improved player.\nAlready the Premier League's top scorer, Salah has been at his most effective when alongside Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino in attack but against Chelsea he had Daniel Sturridge and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for company in Liverpool's front three.\nThe triumvirate may have been different but Salah still showed his class. He was Liverpool's most dangerous player in a first half light on chances, flashing an effort over the bar early on while a promising run along the edge of the box deserved more but there was no team-mate waiting in the box to meet his cut-back.\nIt felt, though, that Salah's name was destined to be written into the story of the game and so it proved. He showed great instinct to anticipate Oxlade-Chamberlain's poked pass and when presented with a clear sight of goal there was little doubt over the outcome.\nSalah did not celebrate the strike, which saw him become Liverpool's highest scorer in a single season since Luis Suarez hit 31 goals in the 2013-14 campaign.\nWillian rescues cautious Chelsea\nChelsea had won two and drawn four in their past six Anfield visits, but despite that record Antonio Conte's team selection suggested this was a must-not-lose game rather than a must-win.\nThe Blues lined up with eight defensive-minded players - five defenders along with three holding midfielders as Tiemoue Bakayoko started alongside former Leicester duo Danny Drinkwater and N'Golo Kante in the middle.\nThat meant Eden Hazard carried all the creative responsibility, a task he grasped fully whenever the visitors had the chance to get forward. His darting runs and sudden changes of direction had the home side's defence on almost constant edge. It was from his through-ball that Mignolet had to race off his line to deny Drinkwater and it was from his pass that Davide Zappacosta forced the Liverpool keeper to tip over the bar.\nHowever, he visibility tired in the second half, weakening Chelsea's attack, and when Salah scored it seemed a Liverpool win was inevitable.\nWillian was unlucky not to have started after scoring twice and providing two assists in Chelsea's midweek win in Azerbaijan and it took just 144 seconds for him to make a telling impact in this game.\nHis three goals in two games is as many as in his previous 25 combined. The Brazilian has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge but his impressive recent form suggests he could still play a part for the Blues this season.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah\nWhat they said - 'The world is a strange and crazy place'\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"Everything was good until Willian crossed the ball. Most parts of the game were good but it doesn't feel it.\n\"But that is how it is. We will be better. The world is a strange and a crazy place at the moment so I can easily live with a point against Chelsea.\n\"It was a good game, an intense game and a very difficult game against a strong Chelsea team.\"\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"I think we must be pleased. Both teams played with a great intensity from the start to the end.\n\"It was very difficult to play this game after a long travel and no rest for my players, and also because when you play at Anfield it is not simple.\n\"In our best moment we conceded the goal and were unlucky. But at the same time I was very happy to see a great reaction from my players, with the way they fought and didn't accept a bad result at Liverpool.\"\nKlopp moves alongside Dalglish et al - the stats\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past six Premier League games against Chelsea (W2 D4) - their joint-longest ever such run against them in the competition (also six between March 1994-September 1996 and November 2010-April 2013).\nHowever, they've not beaten them in the Premier League at Anfield since a 4-1 win in May 2012.\nLiverpool have conceded just two goals in their past nine Premier League games at Anfield, but these goals have cost them a total of four points (1-1 v Burnley, 1-1 v Chelsea).\nOf the 19 sides Antonio Conte has faced in the Premier League as a manager, Liverpool are the only side he has not beaten.\nWillian scored just 144 seconds after coming off the bench - the fastest in the Premier League this season.\nSince Jurgen Klopp joined in October 2015, Liverpool have won 38 Premier League points in fixtures between the 'big six' - six more than any of the other sides (Chelsea have 32).\nIn fact, Klopp is only the fourth Liverpool manager to remain unbeaten in his first five top-flight clashes against Chelsea - the others are David Ashworth, Kenny Dalglish and Roy Evans.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool head to Stoke on Wednesday (20:00 GMT) looking for only their third away league win of the season while Chelsea host struggling Swansea on the same evening (19:45)."

The club has to decide and the sooner that happens the better. The players need this resolving.\n\"What I see is a happy squad but I'd rather have an unhappy squad that's winning.

It was also the third consecutive time that the Gunners had grabbed a winner in stoppage time against the Clarets.\n\"It is a coupon buster,\" said Dyche. \"I don't think anyone would put a bet on that.\n\"I have told the players we continue to develop, we continue to move forward.

Burnley remain seventh.\nThe result was harsh on Dyche's side, who defended valiantly and looked like grabbing at least a point, before referee Lee Mason pointed to the spot after defender James Tarkowski pushed Aaron Ramsey.\nGunners boss Arsene Wenger said: \"From outside it looked 100% a penalty. I don't know why he pushed him in the back. I would like to see it again.\"\nArsenal's Petr Cech was the busier of the two goalkeepers, making two crucial saves to deny Johann Berg Gudmundsson, brilliantly tipping the Iceland international's drive onto the post and keeping out a low, rasping shot.\nRobbie Brady also had a free-kick towards the top corner pushed away by Cech.\nMoving on up\nBefore the game, Arsenal had earned just four points away from home this season and their poor form on their travels looked to be continuing before Sanchez's intervention.\nWenger's side were missing the guile of playmaker Mesut Ozil, who was out through illness, and had just one other shot on target in the match, Lacazette's low drive which was easily dealt with by keeper Nick Pope.\nNacho Monreal drilled a fizzing shot from 25 yards narrowly wide and substitute Jack Wilshere's deflected effort wrong-footed Pope but sailed wide of goal.\nArsenal have now won all six league games in which both Sanchez and Lacazette have started, moving into a Champions League spot behind the two Manchester sides and defending champions Chelsea.\nWenger added: \"It is early, the table changes from one week to another.

Since being held 1-1 by Everton on 21 August they have won 18 consecutive games in all competitions.\n\"We are going to lose,\" said Guardiola. \"That is going to happen - definitely. Today was so close - it's going to happen.\n\"The 18 games in a row is amazing, and we have 11 in the Premier League in a row so that's good. We have a good moment and with the spirit we can go further.\"\nDefeat - Huddersfield's second at home in their first Premier League campaign - leaves the Terriers 11th in the table.\nCity march on\nCity's total of 37 points after 13 games is a Premier League record - and the last time a team led the top flight by eight or more points at the same stage was in 1993-94. Then, Manchester United were 11 points clear and on course to win their second consecutive title.\nGuardiola's men arrived here with 40 goals from their 12 previous league matches, but they lacked their usual ruthlessness in front goal against resilient hosts.\nHome goalkeeper Jonas Lossl denied Aguero on several occasions, while Sane hit the crossbar with a free-kick after his side had drawn level.\nThe league leaders wore the home side down, making 336 successful passes after the break compared to Huddersfield's 37, with Sterling's winner looping agonisingly over Lossl after he had saved from Gabriel Jesus.\nThree more wins and City will draw level with Arsenal's run of 14 straight league victories from February-August 2002. The potential record-equalling fixture? At Manchester United's Old Trafford on 10 December.\nTerriers lacking bite?\nHuddersfield were brave and bold at times in front of a passionate home crowd, and defender Mathias Jorgensen went close to opening the scoring from close range in the first half.\nBut they have scored just nine league goals this season, with Laurent Depoitre, Aaron Mooy and club record signing Steven Mounie the joint-leading scorers on two goals apiece.\nMounie has failed to score since the opening day of the season, and the Benin international only appeared off the bench in the 86th minute against City.\nDavid Wagner's side face trips to Arsenal and Everton this week and, after Huddersfield failed to manage a shot on target against City, the German will be hoping for more threat in front of goal to end a run of two straight defeats.\nWhat the managers said\nTerriers boss David Wagner: \"I think the players have done everything to get a draw, they were solid and focused. Unfortunately we were not able to get over the line. Manchester City is a top team.\n\"I saw everything I wanted to see from my team apart from the loss. The first goal was very good for us and the crowd, who played a huge part. I think it was a penalty to City, it was holding in the box.\n\"We were then unlucky with the second goal.\n\"We have played 13 games in the Premier League and have proved we are competitive. I take a lot of positives, it is unfortunate about the result.\nOn van La Parra's red card: \"I've not seen the video, I only hear the barging and gripping in the face. The referee has seen it and decided it was a red card.\"\nCity manager Pep Guardiola: \"We spoke at half-time about how to react, we had enough chances to score and the first time Huddersfield had a chance they scored. We spoke about not giving up, to keep going.\n\"It was a brilliant move to win the penalty.\n\"It is impossible to win every game easily, this league is so tough. The guys competed amazingly, which is why we won.\"\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling\nNo away-day blues for City - the stats\nManchester City have won their past 11 away matches in all competitions - a record for a top-flight club in English football history.\nHuddersfield have lost five of their past seven Premier League games (W2), after losing just one of their first six.\nSergio Aguero has scored against 31 of the 32 opponents he has faced in the Premier League, only failing to do so in one match against Bolton.\nAguero has scored more penalties than any other Premier League player this season, converting all three of the spot-kicks he has taken - all three penalties were won by Raheem Sterling.\nTwo out of eight of the goals Manchester City have conceded this season have been own goals (Kyle Walker against Stoke and Nicolas Otamendi at Huddersfield).\nHuddersfield were the first Premier League side since Crystal Palace against Watford in March to register a goal without having a shot on target in the match.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield travel to Arsenal on Wednesday at 19:45 GMT, while City host Southampton on the same night at 20:00."

Wes Morgan twice came close with headers as Tottenham struggled with his physicality from set-pieces. Marc Albrighton hustled and harried as well as providing silver-service delivery into the penalty area.\nMahrez was still short of the sort of form that secured the 2016 PFA Player of the Year award, but the Algerian's enduring quality showed as he drifted off the right wing, past Jan Vertonghen and swept home the decisive goal just before the break.\nPuel will know, however, that his predecessor Craig Shakespeare also sought to take Leicester back to the basics that won them the title, only to run out of momentum after initial success.\nTime will be the test of his reign.\nTottenham hit more problems on the home front\nTottenham's position above Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League group is no longer masking some serious stalling on the domestic scene.\nSpurs have won just one of their last six games away from European competition, have lost as many league games as they did in the whole of last campaign and could well be seventh by the end of tomorrow.\nFor all his good work during his time at the club, Mauricio Pochettino's tactics seemed to set his side up for Leicester's counter-attacking sucker-punch.\nA high defensive line left acres of space for Vardy to exploit, and Vicente Iborra and Ndidi had already aimed long balls over the top for the England striker before his sublime opener.\nThe Argentine was not helped by some shockingly poor finishing from his side.\nDele Alli - with three Premier League goals this season - should have beaten Kasper Schmeichel to level after Moussa Sissoko had been denied from a similar position in the first half. Worse was to come with the misses from Eriksen and Llorente.\nErik Lamela's bright cameo - including a cute pass for Kane's 10th of the season - after 13 months out will be one of few positives.\nVardy enjoys two-year anniversary\nTwo years ago to the day, Vardy scored for an 11th successive league game to set a new Premier League record.\nWith one goal in his preceding 10 matches for club and country his current form is less spectacular, but his goal showed that his confidence is undented.\nAs he stretched for his touch, it seemed initially as if the 30-year-old would control Albrighton's lofted through ball, but instead he chipped a delicate, instinctive volley over an advancing Lloris for a superb opener.\nHe celebrated with relish in front of the Tottenham fans and a performance full of aggression and pace kept the visiting defence fully occupied as his team-mates dropped deeper and deeper in the second half.\nVardy and Kane sparred on social media as Leicester closed out their title win two years ago and, while the England team-mates finished with a goal apiece, it was the Leicester man who won this battle.\nMan of the match - Marc Albrighton\n'You must fight' - manager quotes\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"I would say it is the best performance so far.\n\"There are encouraging signs going forward. The goals were fantastic, but not just the goals. The quality with the ball was good as well.\n\"It was difficult against a good team to keep this result but I think the team worked hard for each other with solidarity and desire and it was a fantastic game for us.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think we started so sloppy, that disappointed us a lot.\n\"We need to learn from this that we need to start every game with the first idea to fight and compete.\n\"Leicester showed more than us. Even though we had chances to score and stay in the game, we were poor.\"\nFilbert Street farewell revisited - match stats\nLeicester recorded their first home Premier League victory over Spurs since beating them in their final game at Filbert Street in the 2001-02 season.\nSpurs have now lost as many Premier League games this season as they did in the entirety of last season (four).\nSince the start of last season, Jamie Vardy has scored 11 Premier League goals against the 'big six' - five more than any other player.\nHarry Kane has scored 11 goals against Leicester in all competitions - four more than he has scored against any other club.\nRiyad Mahrez has been involved in five goals in his last seven Premier League appearances (three goals, two assists).\nErik Lamela assisted Kane's goal just 76 seconds after coming on as a substitute.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester take on Burnley at home on Saturday at 15:00 GMT with Tottenham kicking off away to Watford at the same time."

Chris and myself made it a clear that it was a game played in the head not the heart.\n\"It wasn't going to be a rumbustious game with people flying into each other. That's not the way either side play.\n\"Christian Benteke did well for us. He is still feeling his way after such a long lay-off. We hope he will get stronger and stronger and hopefully the team will be more clinical in the final third.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"We have to ask did we play well enough to win the game? Probably not. But neither did they. So it's a fair result.\n\"We had some good opportunities but the longer it went on, the way it went, it was going to be a stalemate, and you felt maybe it would be a set-piece or a mistake that would settle it.\n\"It was a nervous game and didn't have the flow. Maybe not the style that you would expect a derby to have.\"\nThe stats - Palace finally keep a clean sheet\nThis was Crystal Palace's first Premier League clean sheet this season; they are last of the 20 sides in the division to achieve a shut-out.\nHowever, Palace have failed to find the net in nine consecutive away Premier League games.\nRoy Hodgson's side have now failed to score in each of their opening seven away league games of the season. Only Derby County (eight games in 2007/08) have had a longer wait for an away goal at the start of a Premier League campaign.\nBrighton have never lost a top-flight match against Crystal Palace, conceding just three goals in the five meetings at this level (W3 D2).\nChristian Benteke has now gone 10 Premier League games without a goal; he has only gone longer without scoring in the competition once before in January 2014 while at Aston Villa.\nWhat next?\nRoy Hodgson returns to former club West Brom, who are also struggling near the bottom of the Premier League, on Saturday as Crystal Palace face the Baggies at The Hawthorns in a 15:00 GMT kick-off. At the same time, Brighton have another home game, with Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool the visitors to the Amex."

At 3-2 the game is in the balance then Lingard had the initiative to kill the game.\"\nUnited cut the deficit to five points on unbeaten leaders Manchester City, although Pep Guardiola's side can re-establish their eight-point advantage when they host Southampton on Wednesday.\nRelive Manchester United's win over Watford\nDon't count United out\nThe Red Devils had lost their two previous away games in the league at Huddersfield and Chelsea, with Guardiola's City threatening to run away with the title having dropped just two points from their opening 13 games.\nBut United's tally of 32 points after 14 games is their best since the 2012-13 season, Sir Alex's Ferguson's last in charge and their most recent championship triumph.\nCurrent boss Mourinho is often criticised by supporters for his cautious approach, with Old Trafford legend Eric Cantona weighing into the debate this week by saying he prefers the \"attacking football that Guardiola plays\".\nHe started with three at the back against the Hornets, which included Marcos Rojo's first appearance since April because of a knee injury, and was vindicated by some clinical finishing.\nYoung, who started his career at Watford playing for the Hertfordshire club from 2003 to 2007, converted Lingard's pass before netting a second into the top corner. He could have completed a hat-trick but struck the wall with a free-kick.\nFrenchman Martial punished some poor Watford defending by stroking in his eighth of the season, the same total as in the whole of the last campaign.\nBut then United were holding on when Watford pulled to within a goal.\n\"We should be smoking cigars but then were in trouble,\" Mourinho said.\nHowever, his side saved their best for last as Lingard scored from a solo run having collected the ball 60 yards from the net.\n\"I saw the space open up in front of me and just went for it,\" said Lingard. \"Anything can happen in football, so when we conceded we just tried to keep our composure, and then, we tried to do the same when we went ahead again.\"\nLukaku's struggles continue\nStriker Romelu Lukaku's blistering start since joining United featured 11 goals in his first 10 games, but he has now managed just one in his previous 11.\nThe stats show he has been provided fewer chances by his team-mates and attempted fewer shots at goal compared to when he was finishing with regularity.\nAgainst Watford, the Belgian had two shots on target, one effort which was pushed away by goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, who reacted sharply to keep out Lingard's follow-up.\nLukaku's lack of confidence was evident with 15 minutes to go when the ball was presented to him in front of goal, but he took too much time to set himself allowing the Watford defenders to retreat and clear.\nMourinho joked that there might be an easy solution to his striker's lack of goals.\n\"He needs a big contract with boots. At this moment he doesn't have a contract with any brand,\" he said. \"That is why he is playing with the black boots. He needs a brand to give him the right boots and to pay the right money, so he goes back to goals.\n\"Jokes apart, he works amazingly well for the team. I would never blame a player like him for that easy chance he missed. Never.\"\nUnited midfielder Paul Pogba should have got on the scoresheet too, but headed over from eight yards out.\nA concern for United will be an muscular injury to midfielder Nemanja Matic, who hobbled off in the second half.\nNo Silva lining\nWatford manager Marco Silva was Everton's first choice to take over from Ronald Koeman after overseeing an impressive start in which his side have collected 21 points from 14 games.\nThe Hornets play an enterprising brand of football, making use of Richarlison's pace and trickery, while Kiko Femenia caused problems at times with his runs from wing-back.\nSilva, though, needs to work on his side's problems at the back having now let in 25 goals this term, including 12 from set-pieces - more than any other side.\nThey could have snatched something from the game after Rojo's clumsy challenge on Pereyra allowed Deeney to net from the spot and midfielder Doucoure clipped in Andre Carillo's cutback.\nDeeney headed straight at David de Gea as they searched for the leveller, before Lingard struck.\nSilva said: \"We have to keep going, the result is hard to take for us, we didn't deserve this result. In the end the quality was the difference, the individual players, but of course, the budgets of the clubs are so different.\n\"Now it's the moment to rest our players and to analyse what we will do to compete again and show our fans what we can do.\"\nMan of the match - Jesse Lingard (Manchester United)\nDeeney on the spot - the stats\nManchester United have won eight of their nine Premier League games against Watford (L1), scoring at least two goals on seven occasions.\nIndeed, the Hornets have lost more games against Manchester United (eight) than against any other opponent in the Premier League.\nThe Red Devils have scored 32 goals and conceded just eight in the Premier League this term - their goal difference of +24 is their best at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 2000-01 when they won the title (+26).\nAshley Young scored his first Premier League double at Vicarage Road since October 2006, (the last one was while playing for Watford as a 21-year-old against Fulham).\nRomelu Lukaku made his 200th Premier League appearance this evening - only 10 players have scored more goals than the Belgian (93) after 200 outings in the competition.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure has scored five goals in the Premier League this season; only Leroy Sane (six) has netted more among midfielders.\nTroy Deeney has converted 11 of his 12 penalties in the Premier League, including each of his three taken against Manchester United (all at Vicarage Road in each of the last three seasons).\nWhat next?\nWatford host Tottenham on Saturday (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Manchester United travel to Arsenal later that day (17:30 GMT)."

You need that third one to put it to bed.\n\"That's eight points we have lost from winning positions towards the end of a game and it is certainly not through a lack of fitness. Sometimes you can do too much running, daft running, rather than just keep position.\"\nOn fans chanting his name: \"I thank the fans for that. It was like going back 14 years. It was terrific but what wasn't terrific was the result.\"\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez: \"We did well in the first half. We controlled the game. To concede a goal in this was was very disappointing, I was upset, but the reaction of the players, their workrate - these players care. They will try.

Going into the game I expected a quick game from us and we didn't get that, you want to give the crowd something to cling on to and they didn't get that.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We were very dominant, hit the bar, made the keeper work and scored a fine goal.\n\"Where we are in the league, everyone will be surprised by that. I see the players work all the time and have great belief in this squad.\"\nBurnley enjoying life on the road - the stats\nBurnley recorded their fourth away win of the season, their highest tally in a Premier League campaign.\nIt was only the second time Burnley have won successive away games in the Premier League, last doing so in May 2015.\nBournemouth have lost four of their seven home league games this season.\nRobbie Brady scored his first Premier League goal since February, ending a run of 25 games in the competition without one.\nEddie Howe became the 25th different manager to lose a Premier League game on his birthday.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Bournemouth host Southampton on Sunday (13:30 GMT)."

He never hides, he's always available.\"\n5 Live Football Daily: 'A day we'll remember for the rest of our lives' - Guardiola\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League games\nLacazette 'out for a while' with groin injury\n'Unstoppable' Ozil at his best\nAlexandre Lacazette gave Arsenal an early lead with a confident finish after being put through by Aaron Ramsey's clever flick.\nThe visitors went close to an equaliser when Petr Cech pushed Steve Mounie's shot onto the bar not long after the restart.\nBut Arsenal scored three goals in four minutes to end Huddersfield's hopes of getting a surprise result.\nOzil played a one-two with Alexis Sanchez before the former teed up substitute Olivier Giroud to convert from six yards out.\nSoon after, Sanchez made it three with a volley from Ozil's lofted pass.\nOzil capped a superb individual display with a goal, placing the ball beyond Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl after being put through by Ramsey, before Giroud's close-range finish in the final minutes completed the rout.\n\"Ozil is unstoppable against this sort of opposition,\" said former Arsenal striker Ian Wright on Match of the Day.\n\"He is energised at the moment and he has so much ability. He's a beautiful player to watch.\"\nArsenal, who remain fourth, host second-placed Manchester United on Saturday, while Huddersfield drop to 14th.\nArsenal's superb home run continues\nThe Gunners had won their 11 previous Premier League games on home soil prior to the visit of Huddersfield, a run stretching back to April.\nAgainst a side that had not won away from home since the opening game of the season, win number 12 for the hosts always seemed likely, a view that was only enhanced when Lacazette struck after just three minutes.\nThe early goal hinted at a long night for the visitors, but Arsenal - initially - failed to build on it. They laboured for more than an hour against a disciplined Terriers side, misplacing passes in defence and leaving gaps that more clinical sides than Huddersfield would have exploited.\nBut when the second goal arrived on 68 minutes, the Huddersfield defence wilted and, with Giroud also hitting the post and Sanchez shooting over from close range, the win could have been even more comprehensive.\nThe victory for Arsenal, who have now scored 20 goals in seven home games and conceded just four, sets them up nicely for the visit of Jose Mourinho's side this weekend. Should the Gunners win that game then they will move to within a point of United.\nStrong November bodes well for the future\nNovember has traditionally been Arsenal's worst month under Wenger.\nPrior to this season, the Gunners' averaged 1.59 points per game in the penultimate month of the year but, encouragingly, there's been no post-Halloween slump from Wenger side this time.\nWednesday's win was their third in four games this month, with their only loss a 3-1 defeat at Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nConsistency has been Arsenal's problem this term and keeping their November form going will be crucial to their aspirations for the season.\nWith their home form strong, Wenger's attention will turn to improving results on the road. Four of their six away games in the Premier League so far this season have ended in defeat.\nTerriers showed fight, but lack of bite a concern\nHuddersfield deservedly earned plaudits for giving Premier League leaders Manchester City a scare on Sunday, with only Raheem Sterling's fortuitous goal in the closing stages denying the Terriers a point.\nAgainst a side boasting such a formidable home record, and with a trip to Everton coming up on Saturday, David Wagner perhaps saw this weekend's game as the more winnable of the two fixtures this week, a view reinforced by the fact he made six changes for the trip to Arsenal.\nTo Huddersfield's credit, they competed well after falling behind and arguably should have been level long before Giroud doubled the Gunners' lead.\nCollin Quaner, making his first Premier League start, was let down by poor control when he was through on goal in the first half, before the forward's low drive was well held by Cech. Chris Lowe also hit the side-netting with a free-kick.\nBut it is now more than 10 hours without an away goal for Huddersfield, who have hit the back of the net just nine times all season. Only the bottom two sides in the Premier League have scored fewer.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil\nWhat they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We started well but then we lost our focus and our passing and allowed them to come back into the game.\n\"Then we got the second goal and suddenly everyone played with more freedom and more technical quality - then Mesut Ozil showed what he can do.\"\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"If you are to get something out of these games you have to put our opponents under pressure and score. Goals change games.\n\"It isn't a surprise it is getting difficult in the Premier League, it was difficult from the beginning. I think we can still be satisfied with the position we are in at the moment. To lose against Arsenal as Huddersfield Town away from home, it isn't a surprise.\n\"We have learnt from our experiences on Sunday and today. We have had two defeats, they probably shouldn't be a surprise to anybody but we learn from these defeats and we are mentally strong enough to put this behind us.\"\nLacazette loves a goal at home - the stats\nArsenal have now won their past 12 home league games in a row, last enjoying a longer run between February and November 2005 at Highbury (13).\nHuddersfield have failed to score in seven consecutive away games in all competitions - their longest ever such run.\nAlexandre Lacazette scored his fifth home Premier League goal of the season - no other player has more on their own turf (level with Rooney, Sane, Salah, Lukaku and Jesus).\nThere have been seven goals scored in the opening three minutes of Premier League games this season, with Lacazette scoring two of those.\nWith a goal and two assists, Mesut Ozil was directly involved in three goals in a Premier League game for the first time in his career.\nOzil has assisted Olivier Giroud 14 times in the Premier League - only two players have assisted another more often for Arsenal in the competition (Robert Pires to Thierry Henry, 17, and Thierry Henry to Freddie Ljungberg, 15).\nOlivier Giroud has scored 16 goals as a substitute in the Premier League, the fourth highest tally in the competition (Jermain Defoe 23, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Kanu 17).\nWhat next?\nArsenal host Manchester United on Saturday (17:30 GMT) while Huddersfield are on the road again on the same day as they head to Everton (15:00 GMT) in what is set to be Sam Allardyce's first game as Toffees boss."

yet they end the month even further behind leaders Manchester City.\nConte's team were fourth in the table four weeks ago, nine points off Pep Guardiola's side.\nDespite beating Manchester United, West Brom and Swansea, and drawing away to Liverpool, Chelsea are now third in the table but 11 points off the lead.\nHowever December looks like being a month when the champions could make a dent in City's handsome lead - if the pace-setters drop any points.\nConte's side have seven league games against sides currently in the bottom half - Newcastle (home), West Ham (away), Huddersfield (away), Southampton (home), Everton (away), Brighton (home) and Stoke (home) - before the end of the year.\nMan of the match - Lukasz Fabianski (Swansea)\nA-head of the rest - the stats\nChelsea have scored eight headed goals in the Premier League this season - more than any other side.\nSwansea failed to score in any of their four Premier League games in November.\nOnly three clubs have scored fewer goals after 14 games of a Premier League season than Swansea (seven) this season: Derby (five in 2007-08), Bradford (five in 2000-01) and Man City (six in 1995-96).\nCesar Azpilicueta did not start a Premier League game for Chelsea for the first time since December 2015, having played 90 minutes in their past 74 top-flight matches.\nSwansea failed to get a single shot on target in this match - the fourth time they haven't had one in a Premier League game this season.\nOverall in 2017-18, the Swans have attempted a league-low 24 shots on target in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea have a quick turnaround as Newcastle visit Stamford Bridge for a 12:30 GMT kick-off on Saturday -

The Toffees also recorded their first league clean sheet since the opening game of the season against Stoke.\nBig Sam can trust in Rooney\nAllardyce watched a performance drastically at odds with Everton's woeful form of late and will have learned he can still count on captain Rooney, who he selected in his only game as England manager in September 2016 when they beat Slovakia 1-0.\nUnsworth, who left Rooney out for Sunday's 4-1 capitulation at Southampton, has been deploying Rooney in midfield - a role to which he seems increasingly suited.\nPlaying largely in central midfield against the Hammers, he made an impression that will resonate even stronger in Allardyce's mind as he seeks to build on this redemptive win and take Everton further up the table.\n\"Wayne played wherever he wanted to. He was brilliant and controlled midfield. I can't stop Wayne playing there,\" said Allardyce after that England game. He could just as well have been talking about this cold November night at Goodison.\nNo sentiment, no luck, no points\nBeforehand Moyes said there was no room for sentiment on his return to Goodison Park, where he was manager from 2002 to 2013. It was the home team who showed no mercy.\nThe Scot could have been forgiven for thinking his chances of victory were strong against a team previously so bereft of belief or direction, having won only once in 12 games.\nInstead it was the extent of the problems he has walked into at West Ham which will trouble him.\nWithout the injured Andy Carroll's aerial threat, his side failed to muster a single shot before the break against a team that had allowed opponents to take 40 in their previous five halves of football.\nThere were improvements in the second half. Lanzini stung Pickford's palms with a drive from outside the area, and Aaron Cresswell hit the bar with a left-foot shot.\nTheir big chance came when Everton centre-half Williams brought down Diafra Sakho and referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty, but Pickford dived to his right to turn away Lanzini's spot-kick.\nIndividual mistakes, typified by Hart felling Dominic Calvert-Lewin to concede the game's first penalty, then his botched clearance for Rooney's wonder-strike, are making life difficult for the Hammers.\nMoyes will have to find a way to stop them; whether by getting his squad fitter or more time drilling them at their Rush Green training base.\nMan of the match - Wayne Rooney\n'I spoke to Sam but I picked the team' - what they said\nEverton caretaker boss David Unsworth to BBC Sport: \"It's a great night, not for me but for the club. Every player was committed. I asked them to be men tonight. If you can stand up there and fight in times of trouble, that says a lot.\n\"Great hat-trick, great display from Wayne. He was captain for a reason. I'm delighted for the club. I took over when we were in the bottom three and we've got out of it in the six weeks.\n\"We expect more. The players have shown tonight that when they are confident, we can keep clean sheets and score goals. Goodison must be a fortress for the rest of the season if we are to finish in the top half.\n\"I spoke to Sam Allardyce for about 10 or 15 minutes about the season in general, but I picked the team.\"\nWayne Rooney told BBC Sport: \"It's a new chapter. Sam is a very good manager. I'm sure he'll bring some new ideas. We're looking forward to our first session with him tomorrow.\n\"We had to win. We had to stand up and show what good players we are. It's the first step of where we want to go - moving up the league.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes told BBC Sport: \"Not good in the first half but a massive improvement at half-time. We didn't deserve that final score. Mistakes cost us.\n\"The missed penalty was the turning point. It looked too difficult a challenge once we didn't score it. We never really got at it from the start. We allowed them to get a bit of confidence.\n\"I think we saw some positive signs in the second half. It didn't go for us when we needed it. There were a lot of small things we needed to go for us.\"\nRooney is Hammers' chief tormentor - the stats\nWayne Rooney has now scored 14 Premier League goals against West Ham United; more than any other player.\nDavid Moyes has lost all five of his Premier League games against Everton since leaving the club, with an aggregate score of 12-0.\nWayne Rooney's hat-trick tonight came 2,272 days since his last (10 September 2011) - the longest gap between two hat-tricks by a player in Premier League history.\nRooney's hat-trick goal was from 58 yards out - the furthest out that a Premier League goal has been scored from since 4 April 2015 (Charlie Adam for Stoke at Chelsea).\nRooney has scored more goals in his 12 Premier League games for Everton this season (seven) than he did in his 25 league appearances for Manchester United last season.\nRooney has now missed nine penalties in the Premier League; only Teddy Sheringham (10) & Alan Shearer (11) have missed more.\nWest Ham didn't attempt a single shot in this game until the 52nd minute of the match - the third longest wait by a team in a Premier League game this season.\nWhat's next?\nEverton face Huddersfield Town at Goodison on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while West Ham travel to Premier League leaders Manchester City (16:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Southampton\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola says Raheem Sterling's new self-belief is behind his brilliant form after seeing him sink Southampton with a 96th-minute winner.\nSterling's 13th goal of the season gave City a club-record 12th successive Premier League victory which restores their eight-point lead at the top of the table.\nSterling had scored decisive late goals in City's previous two wins, over Feyenoord and Huddersfield, but his third strike of the week was his most dramatic of the lot, and sparked wild celebrations from City boss Pep Guardiola and his bench.\n\"Raheem is a match-winner, it was a fantastic goal, I am so happy for him,\" Guardiola said.\n\"As I have said many times, he is making steps. Before he was a little bit more shy and he did not believe, but now he can do that.\n\"I think his team-mates give him the confidence and say 'we trust in you' but then you have to have the personality to do what he did in the last minute.\"\n5 Live Football Daily: 'A day we'll remember for the rest of our lives' - Guardiola\nThe referee Paul Tierney spoke to Guardiola to calm him down before play restarted and the City boss admitted he lost control of his emotions.\n\"I apologised, I could not control it,\" he added. \"I was so happy like all the fans and all the players. I wanted to run behind 'Ras', but I am not fast enough. We are so happy.\"\nAmong the City players and staff who tried to catch Sterling as he ran the length of the pitch to celebrate his goal was Benjamin Mendy, who is sidelined until spring with a anterior cruciate ligament injury.\n\"Mendy is crazy,\" Guardiola said with a smile. \"He has a six-month injury, and he is running. Disaster!\"\nCity continue their record-breaking start\nCity had taken the lead at the start of the second half when Saints defender Virgil van Dijk got the final touch on Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick.\nBut it appeared Saints got their reward for a determined display when Oriol Romeu swept home Sofiane Boufal's pull-back with 15 minutes remaining.\nSterling, who is enjoying the most prolific season of his career, had other ideas.\nHe had already seen a goal disallowed for a foul on Saints keeper Fraser Forster moments earlier, but was not to be denied - cutting in from the left, exchanging passes with De Bruyne and bending the ball past Fraser Forster.\nGuardiola's side had already made the most successful start in Premier League history, with 37 points from their first 13 games.\nThis win saw them become the first side to reach 40 points from 14 games, and maintains the advantage of eight points over Manchester United that they had at the start of the week.\nNo width out left, but City find a way\nEarlier this month, Guardiola said he could not play Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus together without the width of Mendy on the left.\nWith Mendy a long-term absentee and Sane not fit enough to make the squad, Guardiola asked Jesus to fill in on the left against Saints, with Aguero in the middle.\nDavid Silva, who so often sets the tempo for City's attacks, began the game on the bench and it all left City looking less than fluid going forward.\nThey struggled to break down a Southampton side that put 11 men behind the ball and although they still created enough chances to keep Forster busy, many of their efforts were from distance and easily saved.\nEven after Van Dijk had sliced into his own net, City rarely looked like making the game safe, with misplaced passes bringing groans of frustration from their fans.\nForster's best save of the night saw him deny Jesus after Aguero sent him running clear but, for the third time in a week, City were grateful to Sterling for turning an unconvincing performance into a victory.\nSaints unlucky to leave empty-handed\nSouthampton came agonisingly close to stopping the City juggernaut, and will feel they deserved to leave the Etihad with a point.\nIt might even have been more had they taken their chances from corners in the first half, with Wesley Hoedt heading against the bar and Maya Yoshida firing over from close range.\nSaints boss Mauricio Pellegrino, a former team-mate of Guardiola at Barcelona, has been criticised for his defensive approach but got his team selection and tactics spot on here.\nSouthampton did not manage anywhere near the same level of threat as they did in their 4-1 win against Everton on Sunday, when all 10 of their starting outfield players managed a shot on goal.\nBut this was a very different standard of opposition and Pellegrino and his players rose to the challenge - they were superbly disciplined at the back and a threat when they put the ball into the box.\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling\nThe late, late, Sterling show - the stats\nRaheem Sterling has scored the winning goal in the 84th minute or later in four different competitive games for Manchester City this season, including in each of their last three games.\nSterling has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last 13 competitive appearances for Manchester City (10 goals, two assists).\nCity's winning run in the Premier League is now at 12 games - the only two teams to go on a longer winning run within a single Premier League season are Chelsea (13 in 2016-17) and Arsenal (13 in 2001-02).\nSouthampton have picked up just one point from their past seven Premier League visits to the Etihad Stadium.\nSince his Premier League debut for Manchester City in September 2015, Kevin De Bruyne has had a hand in 51 goals in the competition (17 goals, 34 assists), more than any other midfielder in that time.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City play West Ham at home on Sunday (16:00 GMT KO), the first of nine games for Guardiola's side in December.\nBournemouth host south-coast rivals Southampton earlier the same day (13:30 GMT)."

That's the reason, that's the rule,\" he said.\nHughes under the microscope\nKlopp's side surrendered leads against Sevilla and Chelsea in their last two matches and Stoke gave the German a second half to mostly endure rather than enjoy.\nWith Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Diouf joining Crouch in a sky-scraping forwardline, the visitors' suspect defence often creaked under an aerial attack.\nLiverpool kept their structure and their heads, though, to claim a first away clean sheet of the league season.\nThe Reds were grateful for old boy Joe Allen's profligacy, however, as the Wales midfielder twice dragged shots off target from prime positions in the penalty area after the break.\nHughes will point to those fine margins and the first-half's tight calls, but the direct style that has been successful in recent seasons now has the Potters perched perilously above the drop zone.\nWith just two points from their last four games and back-to-back defeats, Hughes could find he is the next manager under the microscope if the Potters' nine-season stay in the top flight becomes seriously threatened.\nMan of the match - Joe Gomez\n'They've got away with one' - analysis\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"It should be a sending off for Mignolet. Diouf is ahead of Joe Gomez and he would have put the ball in an empty net. They've got away with one.\"\nFormer Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright on Match of the Day: \"It's absolutely a sending off for Mignolet. It's a sending off.\n\"I am worried about Stoke, they are not getting any luck. I am concerned for Mark Hughes, it's very precarious for managers at the moment.\"\nLiverpool rotate to find winning combination - match stats\nLiverpool have now made 48 changes to their starting XI this season in the Premier League, 11 more than Everton - the next most-changed side.\nLiverpool have lost just one of their last 10 Premier League games, winning five and drawing four.\nMane scored for first time in six Premier League games for Liverpool, ending a five-game top-flight goal drought - the longest he has endured for the Reds.\nSalah has had a hand in 14 goals in his 14 games for Liverpool in the Premier League (12 goals, 2 assists).\nWhat's next?\nStoke meet Swansea at home at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, with Liverpool travelling to Brighton at the same time."

The Spain international nodded in from barely a yard out.\nNewcastle, perhaps fearful of a capitulation similar to the one they had at Old Trafford recently, sat back after the break.\nHowever, Chelsea still found gaps and won a penalty when Ritchie brought down Moses. The unflappable Hazard dinked the resulting spot-kick past Karl Darlow for his sixth goal against Newcastle in the league.\nThe Magpies keeper then denied the Belgian a hat-trick when he stuck out a hand to claw away a shot.\nHazard was substituted to a standing ovation moments later. It was the least he deserved.\nNewcastle slip again after promising start\nDefeat at Stamford Bridge means it is now no wins in six for Rafael Benitez's Newcastle.\nAsked in a post-match interview why that was the case, the Spaniard replied: \"It's the Premier League.\"\nJust as they had in the opening quarter of last month's match at Manchester United, the Magpies took the lead.\nGayle, who started in place of Joselu, tapped in after following up Thibaut Courtois' parry from Jacob Murphy's shot.\nThen, once again, the difference in quality began to show.\nThe usually reliable Ritchie conceded a penalty and made a mistake for Chelsea's second, midfielder Mikel Merino misplaced passes, and bar his goal Gayle only had one other touch in the Chelsea box.\nNewcastle can assert their authority in games but appear not to have the players to sustain it.\nThey remain five points clear of the relegation zone but come January could easily find themselves in yet another dogfight.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\n'Hazard was unplayable' - analysis\nMatch of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said: \"Eden Hazard was unplayable at times, Newcastle could not get near him. His game just had everything and his feet are so quick - just magnificent.\n\"He just has everything in his game. He destroyed Newcastle, but he will destroy some more teams this season.\"\n'We showed good intensity' - the reaction\nChelsea head coach Antonio Conte, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I think our start wasn't good enough. After going 1-0 down, we started to play with good intensity and good football. Our start was a bit slow.\n\"We did well after only two days' rest. It was a solid performance despite the goal. We showed good motivation and good intensity. I made rotations in the game and the response of my players was positive.\n\"I think that today, to play and win after two days of rest means a lot. Newcastle had the advantage with one day more of rest.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"We made mistakes against good players. With the quality they have, they punish you.\n\"We were in the game and you never know what can happen at one each, 2-1. A top side played against a team that was giving everything.\n\"We knew him [Hazard] really well. He has good movements. You cannot control everyone. When he received the ball he can make the difference. We were doing quite well for a while but mistakes made the difference.\"\nCapital punishment for Newcastle - the stats\nChelsea recorded their 16th Premier League home win against Newcastle - their joint-most versus one side alongside Spurs (also 16 wins).\nConte has won all 17 Premier League games with Chelsea in which Hazard has scored.\nNewcastle lost their 70th Premier League game in London - the joint-most of any away side in the competition (level with Everton).\nNewcastle have won just one of their past 19 away Premier League games (W1 D4 L14).\nSince the start of season, Morata has scored 11 headed goals, more than any other player in Europe's big five leagues.\nHazard has scored more Premier League goals versus Newcastle United than against any other team in the competition (six).\nHazard has had a hand in 11 goals in his past 10 games in all competitions for Chelsea (eight goals, three assists).\nSince the start of last season, Gayle has scored 25 league goals for Newcastle, more than double any other player has netted for the club.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) and are then at London rivals West Ham (12:30 GMT) next Saturday.\nNewcastle entertain Leicester next Saturday (17:30 GMT)."

It is a long-term project. It will be good for the future. You want to win but in tough moments you learn.\n\"I think it wasn't intentional for Davinson to do what he did. I am not going to talk about the refereeing decision any more.\n\"For me one of the first questions is about a controversial situation. My decision is not going to change it.\"\nThis was Tottenham's fourth Premier League match without a victory, although they do climb above Burnley, who lost 1-0 at Leicester, while Watford remain eighth.\nReferee Atkinson makes the headlines again\nBoth managers might have felt hard done by as a thrilling encounter was marked by controversial incidents.\nWatford will feel aggrieved that Tottenham were given the chance to equalise in the first half after Richarlison looked to have been blocked off in the Spurs penalty area by Ben Davies.\nHowever, referee Martin Atkinson, who caused controversy on Wednesday by failing to send off Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet for what looked to be a professional foul on Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf, waved play on.\nTottenham quickly countered down the right through Kieran Trippier, who was repeatedly allowed to advance with the ball, and he released Eriksen, who slid in a low pass which Son tucked away from close range.\nSanchez was dismissed seven minutes into the second half when the defender caught Richarlison with his elbow.\nIn a fiery encounter, Tottenham's Harry Kane and Dele Alli were both on the receiving end of some tough challenges throughout the match, with four Watford players getting cautioned.\nWatford show their fighting spirit\nFor Watford, it is another impressive result in what has been a superb season so far since Marco Silva took over in the summer.\nThe Hornets finished one place above the relegation zone in 2016-17 under Walter Mazzarri, but Silva, appointed manager in May, has helped transform the side into a hard-to-beat, physical, but talented team.\nThis result is the third time this season that Watford have not lost against a top-six side, after also drawing 3-3 with Liverpool in August and beating Arsenal 2-1 in October.\nSilva, who was wanted as Everton boss before the Toffees appointed Sam Allardyce earlier this week, watched his team take the lead when Kabasele outjumped Kane to head the hosts in front.\nAfter Son's equaliser and Sanchez's dismissal, Watford came closest to taking the three points but Doucoure's excellent 25-yard strike bounced off the inside of the post and away to safety.\nWatford also could have had a late penalty when the ball appeared to hit the arm of Tottenham's Eric Dier, but Atkinson was not interested.\nMan of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford)\nKabasele a threat from corners - the stats\nWatford have never beaten Tottenham in the Premier League (drawn three, lost six).\nSpurs have now kept just one clean sheet in their past seven Premier League games, after registering four shut-outs in the five games before that.\nChristian Eriksen provided his first Premier League assist since the opening weekend against Newcastle, ending a run of 13 appearances without one.\nSon Heung-Min has scored four and assisted two more in his last seven starts in all competitions for Tottenham.\nChristian Kabasele has scored two goals in 14 Premier League games this season, equalling his tally from last season in 16 appearances. All four of his goals in the competition have come from corner situations.\nTottenham players have been shown two red cards in their last 10 Premier League games, as many as in their previous 111.\n'You can't just turn up in the big games' - analysis\nAlan Shearer, Match of the Day pundit\nI didn't think the referee (Martin Atkinson) was decent at all. I don't think it was a penalty on Richarlison, but the referee gave a red card (to Davinson Sanchez), which I think is slightly harsh. Sanchez has not thrown his elbow out.\nIt is alright playing in the glory games against Real Madrid, but in the Premier League, Tottenham are starting so slowly.\nThey are missing Toby Alderweireld but that is not an excuse for the way they are starting. I thought Dele Alli was poor, sloppy.\nFrom a Spurs point of view you just can't turn up in the big games, you have to turn up against the smaller teams and that is why Tottenham will not win the league.\n'I want everybody with their feet on the floor' - what they said\nWatford manager Marco Silva told BBC Sport: \"We did everything to win, like Tottenham, and it was a tough game for both teams.\n\"It was 1-1 at half-time and a rough game in the second half. We know against Tottenham we can lose our balance in a counter-attack, but against 10 we tried everything and had chances to score.\n\"In some moments in the last decision we need to do better. In the last cross and the last decision, it is not the best.\n\"We need to keep going and nothing changes. In the last game against Manchester United [which Watford lost 4-2] we did our best and the players again showed good commitment and attitude. This is our way.\n\"Everybody knows what our hope is - to remain a club in the Premier League. We have started well and everybody is enjoying it, but I want everybody with their feet on the floor. This game showed me we need to improve a lot and continue working hard.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"We deserved more. In the second half we played more than 40 minutes with one less and the team was brave and tried to win the game.\n\"I am happy. In the last few weeks we have been frustrated but the face the team showed today was good. Sometimes you need to feel that frustration and learn.\n\"It is so difficult to play with one less. The good thing is we did not concede and we were also close to scoring. We handled the game well during the second half and I was happy with the performance.\"\nWhat's next?\nFor Watford, they play next on Saturday, 9 December with a trip to Burnley (15:00 GMT), before an away game at Crystal Palace on Tuesday, 12 December (20:00 GMT).\nTottenham have three home games in a row, starting on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) in the Champions League against Cypriot side Apoel Nicosia, although Spurs have already secured top spot in Group H and a place in the last 16. After that, Pochettino's side have Premier League games against Stoke on Saturday, 9 December (15:00 GMT) and Brighton on Wednesday, 13 December (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-0 Huddersfield Town\nSam Allardyce said it was \"onwards and upwards\" for Everton after they beat Huddersfield 2-0 in his first game in charge.\nAllardyce, appointed manager on an 18-month contract on Thursday, oversaw a performance that was strong on effort, if short on quality at times.\nGylfi Sigurdsson had a poor game overall, but finished neatly less than two minutes into the second half after Dominic Calvert-Lewin's lovely angled back-flick played him in.\nEngland youth forward Calvert-Lewin, Everton's outstanding player, added a deserved goal when he ran on to Wayne Rooney's pass and scored via a deflection off Mathias Jorgensen.\n\"Getting a win in your first game after a fantastic win on Wednesday night, and back-to-back league wins for the first time this season - let's hope it's onwards and upwards, boys,\" said Allardyce, whose side are now 10th in the table.\n'A cold shower and unexpected warmth - Allardyce's perfect first day at Everton'\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nThe former England boss is back in management for the first time since leaving Crystal Palace in May after taking them from the relegation zone to a 14th-place finish in five months.\n\"It took me six games at Palace to get my first win and everybody was telling everybody else I'd come back too soon, I wasn't the man I used to be,\" the 63-year-old said.\n\"If I take a job I'm totally, fully, 100% committed and I don't take the job in any other circumstances.\n\"I turned many a job down before this one. I felt this one was right for me. It's a dream job for me and I'll give it 100%.\"\nLaurent Depoitre nearly scrambled in a first-half goal for Huddersfield following a corner from Tom Ince, who fired into the side-netting after half-time.\nBut David Wagner's side remain without a goal away from home since the opening day of the season, and have lost four league games in a row for the first time since 2000 as they drop to 15th.\nBig Sam goes back to basics\nNearly a month before his appointment, Allardyce appeared as a pundit on television in Qatar to suggest that Everton needed to get back to basics to pull away from trouble.\nHe also emphasised, at the time, the need to keep clean sheets and become difficult to beat - and was as good as his word in his first game in charge.\nAllardyce's side looked more solid at the back than they have for much of the campaign, although they were facing opponents with only nine league goals to their name all season.\nEverton took a while to get going, and did not even manage a touch inside Huddersfield's penalty area until 25 minutes in, when Cuco Martina's first-time shot was pushed away by Jonas Lossl.\nThroughout the game, though, Everton were prepared to get stuck in. Rooney left Scott Malone feeling sore with a bang on the head after a first-half aerial challenge, and that typified the home side's determination.\nIt was also notable that their heads did not drop when things went against them. Sigurdsson delivered three dreadful set-pieces in the first 45 minutes, yet he shrugged that off to score the opening goal, having been moved further forward by Allardyce at half-time\nEverton's new coaching set-up could be an entertaining spectacle on the touchline - Allardyce wore a large earpiece so he could speak to first-team coach Craig Shakespeare in the stand, while assistant Sammy Lee was a bundle of energy in the technical area, whether shouting instructions or making points to the fourth official.\nCalvert-Lewin ready to come of age\nOne great encouragement for Allardyce as he tries to lift Everton up the Premier League was the enthusiastic display of Calvert-Lewin.\nThe forward, signed from Sheffield United in August 2016, has been working to prove himself at the top level since scoring the goal that won the Under-20 World Cup for England in June.\nHe has had to learn quickly during a turbulent season, and has understandably found that a tough task.\nHowever, he has a strong work ethic and physical presence and was not shy about throwing himself into challenges - in the air or on the ground.\nHe was in the right place to clear as Depoitre fought to turn in Ince's corner amid a goalmouth melee, and left both Christopher Schindler and Jorgensen with bumps and bruises after first-half clashes.\nCalvert-Lewin has skill, too - his deft flick for Sigurdsson's goal was evidence of that.\nHe was then denied a goal, as Lossl dived to his left to push away the striker's drive after Rooney's neat touch had played him in.\nCalvert-Lewin did get the goal he deserved, though, bursting on to Rooney's pass and getting a break as Jorgensen, diving into the challenge, got a touch that bounced the shot beyond Lossl.\n\"I'm so pleased Dominic got a goal after his work on the front line,\" said Allardyce.\n\"[He's] a young centre-forward learning his trade in the Premier League and to get that goal at that particular time just killed Huddersfield off.\"\nHuddersfield's goal trouble persists\nHuddersfield's problem is obvious - they are not scoring enough goals.\nOf the nine they have struck in the Premier League this season, three came on the opening day against a Crystal Palace side in turmoil; just six have come in 14 matches since.\nHead coach Wagner said on Friday that he was happy with the two centre-forwards in his squad, with Depoitre selected against Everton rather than club-record signing Steve Mounie.\nDepoitre is a willing runner with a good touch and power in the air, but has shown little sign of being a prolific scorer since his \u00a33.4m move from Porto in June.\nMounie, meanwhile, has been battling a heel injury for much of the season, and did not look up to speed when he started Wednesday's 5-0 defeat at Arsenal.\nInce - whose father Paul, the former England captain, watched from the stand - has yet to score since his summer move from Derby.\nThe forward's shot, high into the side-netting on the break as Huddersfield trailed 1-0, was probably as close as they came to a goal at Goodison Park.\nThe visitors did not create enough, though. And as disciplined as they are defensively, they are likely to be sucked into the bottom three unless they become more of an attacking threat.\n\"We will keep on fighting and keep on analysing,\" said Wagner.\n\"Today we can analyse we were not good enough, especially in the final third. The quality was not good enough but the players have shown they have it.\"\nMan of the match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nWhat next?\nEverton bow out of the Europa League against Apollon Limassol in Cyprus on Thursday (18:00 GMT) before facing Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League the following Sunday (14:15). Huddersfield host Brighton next Saturday (15:00)."

He made good runs and created a lot of chances.\"\nLeicester's victory means they have lost just one of their last 10 games in all competitions - and that was against Manchester City.\nBrady injury blunts Burnley's threat\nThe biggest concern for Burnley will be the extent of Brady's injury, after he was stretchered off in the first half.\nHe had gas, air and heavy strapping on his left leg as he was carried off following a nasty tackle on Maguire.\nBrady has been one of Sean Dyche's most reliable players this season and after grabbing an assist and a goal against Bournemouth on Wednesday, it was a blow to see him come off within the opening half hour.\nPrior to that lengthy halt in play, Burnley had been well on top, having had seven shots on goal in the opening 25 minutes.\nThey were shaken by his departure and Leicester were able to exert pressure of their own throughout the second half and went on to pick up their second victory in a week.\nWith 14 appearances for Burnley this season, Dyche admitted it was a \"blow\" to lose Brady and confirmed he had gone to hospital amid concerns of a \"serious injury\".\nMan of the Match - Demarai Gray\n'An important win' - reaction\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"On the pitch it was a difficult game, they are with confidence. We saw this in the first half.\n\"It was important to win this game. I think it's a good result and a good reward for the players and their hard work on the pitch.\n\"We need to continue to improve all of the time. We need to keep this positive attitude.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"They're in good form. It was a poor goal from our point of view. In the second half it becomes a bit more like a basketball match and they defend and counter.\n\"At the end we have a chance to nick one but [we did] not [get] the rub of the green. We like the fact we are keeping games tight, that's an important theme for me. I've said to the players: 'We're progressing.'\"\nOn Brady: \"We're waiting on news but we think it's more serious than not serious. We'll just have to wait and see.\"\nRare goalscoring blank for Burnley - the best of the stats\nThe Foxes are unbeaten in their last seven league home games against Burnley (W4 D3 L0), including wins in the last two games.\nPuel has won three of his first four Premier League home games in charge of Leicester, with the Foxes winning successive home league games for the first time this season.\nLeicester have lost just one of their last 10 games in all competitions (W5 D4 L1) - the loss was a 0-2 defeat against Manchester City.\nThis is just the second time in their last 11 Premier League away games that Burnley have failed to score, also drawing a blank at Man City in October.\nAfter three successive PL wins and clean sheets, the Clarets have conceded a goal in each of their last three, losing twice and winning once.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley return to Turf Moor to take on Watford next Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Leicester travel to St James' Park for the late kick-off.

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-5 Liverpool\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side still have \"really hard work\" in front of them despite continuing their phenomenal goalscoring away from home by hitting five at Brighton.\nThe Reds moved into the top four of the Premier League for the first time since August after making it 15 goals in their past four away games in all competitions with a comfortable victory at the Amex Stadium.\n\"It looks like we are flying,\" said Klopp after Liverpool's fifth win in six league games.\n\"Unfortunately it's not like that, we have to work really hard.\n\"We need results. In our calmer moments we are a really good team, but we need to carry on.\n\"I'm much more interested in the next game. We need the points - we want to stay as close as possible to the teams in front of us.\"\n'Liverpool gave us a harsh lesson'\nEmre Can powered a header beyond Mat Ryan from Philippe Coutinho's corner after half an hour and the Reds doubled their lead 79 seconds later following a sumptuous move.\nMohamed Salah drove at the Brighton defence and picked out Coutinho, who slid a left-footed cross to the back post for Roberto Firmino to finish efficiently.\nBrazil striker Firmino made it 3-0 after Salah's brilliant assist before Glenn Murray, who had already missed two great chances, beat Simon Mignolet with a penalty following Jordan Henderson's foul on Shane Duffy.\nBrighton had chances to make it more nervy for Liverpool with a second goal, but Coutinho eased any concerns about a repeat of Sevilla's comeback from 3-0 down in the Champions League by scoring with a cute low free-kick then enticing Brighton defender Lewis Dunk to head into his own net.\n\"The biggest disappointment is that you have to stay in the game,\" said Seagulls boss Chris Hughton.\n\"They were always going to have more possession, but after 30 minutes we had had the best chance - and then within two minutes we were 2-0 down.\n\"You have got to have a level of performance to have a chance. I thought they were very good and gave us a harsh lesson, but we were also below the levels we have set this season.\"\nKlopp's side move above Arsenal, who lost 3-1 at home to Manchester United, while Brighton drop to 11th in the table.\nReaction from the Amex Stadium\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nReds overcome defensive changes\nThis was another masterclass in the art of scoring by the Reds, but despite conceding a goal, it was also a triumph at the other end of the pitch.\nKlopp was without several defenders. Joe Gomez (virus) and Joel Matip (injured) were unavailable, Alberto Moreno was rested and Ragnar Klavan (ill) only on the bench - meaning the German fielded an unfamiliar back line in terms of both formation and personnel.\nLiverpool lined up with three centre-backs - and one of those was Georginio Wijnaldum, whose reputation was forged as a No.10 in the Netherlands and who had been brought to Anfield in July 2016 to score goals from midfield.\nKlopp also selected midfielder Can as the right-sided centre-back and handed Scotland left-back Andy Robertson his first Premier League start since 16 September.\nSo it was perhaps inevitable that Liverpool wouldn't be rock solid at the back but fortunately for them, other than his penalty kick, Murray was profligate when the re-jigged defence permitted the home side chances.\n\"We had big problems line-up wise,\" added Klopp. \"But for this game today the formation fitted really well.\"\nDunk scores third own goal of the season\nBrighton frustrated Manchester United for more than an hour at Old Trafford last week before Dunk's unfortunate own goal proved the difference between the sides.\nThis time, the Seagulls were well on their way to defeat when the defender's header into his own net made it 5-1 in the 89th minute.\nDunk also put past his own keeper on the opening weekend of the season against Manchester City, and is now one own goal away from equalling ex-Reds defender Martin Skrtel's record of four in a single Premier League season - which the Slovakia centre-half achieved in 2013-14.\nAfter the game, Brighton boss Chris Hughton described Liverpool as the best offensive side his side had faced since Pep Guardiola's City.\nBut his team helped their opponents to victory. In addition to Dunk's gift, the wall for Coutinho's goal failed miserably to do its job, Can out-jumped a static home defence for his first league goal of the season and they were hopelessly caught on the counter attack for Firmino's second goal.\nBrighton had not conceded more than two goals in a game before this match and their response to this emphatic defeat will be one of their biggest tests of character since winning promotion to the Premier League.\n54 changes - and the wins keep coming\nKlopp made a further six changes to his side following the 3-0 win at Stoke City on Wednesday.\nLiverpool have made a total of 54 changes to their starting line-up this season in 15 Premier League games - more than any other side.\nTheir fifth win in six top-flight games was achieved without Senegal winger Sadio Mane or England striker Daniel Sturridge making it onto the pitch from the bench, and with England midfielder Adam Lallana not available after his long lay-off.\nKlopp is likely to rotate his squad again for the Champions League game with Spartak Moscow next Wednesday as well as in the Merseyside derby at Anfield on 10 December.\nAt the moment, it doesn't seem to matter which of his attacking players he fields away from home - lots of goals and positive results seem to follow.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\n'One of Europe's best counter-attacking teams' - analysis\nIan Wright, BBC Match of the Day pundit\nLiverpool are unbeaten in six Premier League games, winning five of them, and they are just so quick and have everything in that front three. Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho just have so much pace and they also had Sadio Mane on the bench.\nThey are one of the best counter-attacking teams I have seen in Europe. This was a real eye-opener for Brighton.\n26 not out for Firmino - the stats\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2015, Roberto Firmino has netted 26 goals in the competition, more than any other Liverpool player.\nBrighton have gone five home leagues games without a win (D4 L1) for the first time since April 2015.\nLiverpool have won three consecutive away league games after enjoying just one victory in the previous five on the road.\nGlenn Murray has netted five goals in his last seven league appearances for the Seagulls after drawing a blank in each of the six before that.\nMohamed Salah has played a part in 15 goals in his first 15 Premier League games for Liverpool - more than any other player for the club (12 goals, 3 assists).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton have a week to recover from this result - they go to Huddersfield next Saturday (15:00 GMT). Liverpool are in Champions League action in midweek as the Reds seek to confirm a place in the knockout stage for the first time since 2008-09 when they host Spartak Moscow (19:45 GMT) on Wednesday."

I'm looking forward to working with the guys.\"\nWhile the Baggies stay 17th in the table, one place above their opponents, there were positives to be taken.\nIn defence, they arrested a run of 10 games without a clean sheet, and created plenty of opportunities at the other end.\nThe latter was facilitated by a more attacking line-up, switching from five at the back to 4-3-3, with Robson-Kanu, Rodriguez and Salomon Rondon the focal points.\nAnd the Venezuelan Rondon could have won it at the end had he not headed wide with the goal at his mercy.\n...and also for Hodgson\nGiven that they have been bottom of the table since the opening day, Palace will settle for this imperfect point, which takes them up to 18th.\nRoy Hodgson's side had to contend with a far-from-ideal build-up that consisted of a delayed train, illness to Scott Dann, and Hennessey's injury in the warm-up.\n\"The scenario couldn't have been much worse.\" said Hodgson. \"But I'm really pleased with the way we played and it was a well-deserved and valuable point.\n\"We were lucky nothing happened to Julian Speroni as we don't know who'd have played in goal.\n\"Wayne's back went into spasm. It's not the first time it's happened. We're not blessed with back spasms, we had Ruben Loftus-Cheek too.\"\nBut it did not stop them securing a second successive away clean sheet in the Premier League for the first time since January 2015 - and perhaps accounted for their willingness to settle for a point as time ticked on.\nOn a day of reunions, Hodgson returned to The Hawthorns as an opposing manager for the first time since leaving for the England job in 2012.\nHis 14-month tenure saw him steer them away from relegation before delivering a 10th-place finish a year later.\nOf the warm reception he received, Hodgson said: \"To get that reception as an away manager was touching. I'm really grateful for it. It put the biggest smile on my face for a long time.\"\nThe gap to a position of safety stays at three points but this result, coupled with the midweek draw at Brighton, should give Hodgson plenty of heart.\nMan of the match - Julian Speroni (Crystal Palace)\nUnwanted history for Palace - the stats\nPardew became the fifth manager to take charge of at least five different Premier League clubs. He has won three and drawn two of his opening games with his five sides.\nPalace are the first Premier League team to fail to score in 10 consecutive away games (D2 L8).\nThe Eagles are the first English top-flight team to go 10 away games in a row without a goal since Manchester City in 1950 (12 games).\nWest Brom attempted 20 shots, their highest shot tally in a Premier League game since December 2015 against Newcastle (22).\nPalace have kept consecutive away Premier League clean sheets for the first time since January 2015.\nThe Baggies have taken 32 points from their 34 Premier League games in 2017 (W7 D11 L16), the fewest total of any Premier League side to appear in the past two seasons.\nWhat's next?\nAlan Pardew's second game as West Brom boss sees the Baggies go to Swansea on Saturday, 9 December (15:00 GMT).

It was a great strike from Wilf, you have to say,\" said Hughes. \"It would have been very easy to feel sorry for ourselves.\n\"We had to show courage and character and clear our heads. We dusted ourselves down and set about trying to do something about the situation.\"\nStoke should have finished the game off but Diouf headed wide and Shaqiri shot over.\nAnd the hosts needed a fine save from Jack Butland to ultimately seal the points - the England goalkeeper saving an attempted clearance from Ryan Shawcross.\nThey held on for their first win since 28 October - and a first victory at home since September - to move six points clear of the bottom three.\nWhile victory brought relief for the Potters boss, Clement's problems continue - this was Swansea's 10th league defeat of the season.\nHowever, Hughes said he would be without defender Bruno Martins Indi for \"three to four weeks minimum\" after the 25-year-old strained his groin and left the field on a stretcher in the 53rd minute.\nGraft does the trick for Stoke\nThis was an old-fashioned kind of win for the Potters - one based on graft, perseverance and big men at either end.\nPeter Crouch contributed to Diouf's winner with a trademark headed flick-on from Shawcross' long ball, before Butland ensured they kept the points with his outstanding late save.\nBut it was the energy of midfielder Joe Allen that inspired the hosts.\nAfter they fell behind so early, the Welshman created the equaliser by pinching the ball from Leroy Fer.\nAnd he never stopped. Allen covered 12.4 km - more than any Swansea player - and made more sprints (63) than any other player.\nHe won the ball back for his side eight times, and also made the most tackles (three) and interceptions (three) for the hosts.\nSwansea lose their 'cup final'\nClement had described this game as a \"cup final\"\n, external\n- and afterwards he angrily conceded his side \"deserve to be bottom\".\nFor 35 minutes it seemed as though his pre-match attempt to focus the minds of his players on the magnitude of the fixture had worked.\nBony discovered how to score again, and the visitors looked bright, with Martin Olsson raiding effectively down the left and Tammy Abraham making some clever runs.\nBreaking a seven-hour run without a goal appeared to have revived the visitors' belief - but two goals in four minutes by Stoke deflated them again.\n\"It's not just frustrating because of the result and performance today but the whole period we are in. We are bottom of the table and deserve to be bottom,\" said Clement.\n\"I can't say we are unlucky, we've just not been good enough.\n\"Today was typical of us. We got off to a great start and it looked encouraging. But then there was a big mistake for the first goal, and I'm also disappointed with the second goal - we were too deep.\n\"After that our performance showed our mental fragility at the moment. I'm very angry and disappointed with what we are showing.\n\"The fact we are playing West Brom at home next - another team who have difficulties - it's another huge game. We have got to make sure we don't get cut adrift.\"\nSwansea had more possession in the second half (64.3%) and overall (56.2%) than Stoke, but could not capitalise.\nAt 2-1, Abraham worked his way into space and played a ball across Stoke's area that nobody in white attacked. Bony's only shot on target was his goal.\nIf they cannot find more cutting edge, Swansea will continue to lose games like this - when there is otherwise little between the teams.\nMan of the match - Joe Allen (Stoke City)\nSwansea's misery at Stoke goes on - the stats\nStoke have scored in all seven of their home Premier League games against the Swans.\nSwansea bagged their first Premier League goal after 431 minutes thanks to Wilfried Bony.\nXherdan Shaqiri has been directly involved in nine goals in his last 11 Premier League games (four goals, five assists) - his joint-best return in a PL season.\nTwo of Shaqiri's last three PL goals have come inside the box, this after his previous six in a row had arrived from outside the area.\nWilfried Bony has scored six goals in his five appearances in Premier League games between Stoke and Swansea - scoring twice for Stoke and four times for Swansea.\nIn fact, that was Bony's first Premier League goal since a brace against Swansea in October 2016 - 397 days ago.\nThe Ivory Coast striker's goal (on two minutes 19 seconds) was the earliest the Swans had scored in a Premier League game since August 2014, when Nathan Dyer struck against West Brom after one minute and 27 seconds.\nWhat's next?\nStoke travel to Tottenham on Saturday, 9 December (15:00 GMT) while Swansea host fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion at the Liberty Stadium on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-3 Manchester United\nManchester United ruthlessly punished defensive errors to become the first side to win a league game at Arsenal since January in one of the matches of the season so far.\nJose Mourinho's side were reduced to 10 men late on when Paul Pogba was sent off for a dangerous tackle and they were aided by a stunning goalkeeping display by David de Gea throughout.\nBut they did telling damage early on when Antonio Valencia pounced on a loose Laurent Koscielny pass to drill the opener, before Jesse Lingard side-footed a second after robbing Shkodran Mustafi to link smartly with Romelu Lukaku and Anthony Martial.\nThe strikes meant United had scored as many goals in 11 minutes as they had in eight away fixtures against the Premier League's so-called 'big six' clubs.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nWatch: Pogba hopes injuries will cause Man City to slip up\n5 live's Football Daily: Mourinho praises \"amazing\" Manchester United\nAn end-to-end first-half, which delivered 20 shots on goal, saw Arsenal hit the woodwork through Alexandre Lacazette and Granit Xhaka during a frenetic goalmouth scramble, before De Gea denied Hector Bellerin, Sead Kolasinac, and spectacularly prevented a Lukaku own goal.\nThe Spaniard could do nothing about Lacazette's simple finish on 48 minutes but after Lingard had hit the post in a breathless start to the second half, De Gea produced an unbelievable double save from Lacazette and Alexis Sanchez.\nHis heroics maintained the advantage during an opening 15 minutes to the second half which saw United have just 26% of possession, but Lingard was on hand to tap in a third on 63 minutes after good work by Pogba.\nPogba was dismissed when he mistimed a tackle to effectively stamp on the back of Bellerin's leg, and the Frenchman will now miss the Manchester derby next Sunday.\nBut his moment of woe felt merely a footnote in a riveting encounter which moved second-placed United to within five points of their city rivals.\nMourinho opens up in a thriller\nMourinho has garnered a reputation for defensive set-ups on trips to the league's traditional big clubs but his side went after their hosts early on, hounding possession high up the pitch to great effect.\nTheir opening two goals owed much to slack use of possession by the home side but needed clinical finishes, notably when Martial cleverly flicked into the path of Lingard for the second.\nThe reward for their adventure secured a first win for Mourinho in his past 12 away fixtures against the 'big six'.\nHe could be forgiven for not enjoying seeing Arsenal fire 33 shots at goal and said he later told De Gea - who equalled the league record for saves in a match - he had witnessed the \"best from a goalkeeper in the world\".\nArsene Wenger also labelled De Gea \"absolutely outstanding\" but while his brilliance points to United riding their luck at times, they were impressive in offering a balance between defence and attack.\nNemanja Matic was consistently well placed, never more so than when blocking a goal-bound Aaron Ramsey shot with the score at 2-0.\nAnd the presence of the defensive midfielder once again freed Pogba, who in bursting into the box to lay on Lingard's second now has five assists this season, surpassing his four in the previous campaign.\nWhether Mourinho will choose to live so dangerously against Manchester City next week remains to be seen, but those watching from a neutral stance would be fortunate to see a game as good as this one again.\nErrors leave a mountain to climb\nWenger spoke of a \"good performance\" and \"impeccable attitude\" from his players but he will be familiar with this feeling.\nOnly twice in 18 meetings with Mourinho has he got the upper hand and the charitable way in which his side gave away goals will not sit well.\nKoscielny's cross-field pass and Mustafi's indecision ultimately left a mountain to climb if Arsenal were to record a 12th straight home win in the league.\nThe ease with which Pogba sauntered into the area to create a third just as Arsenal were seeking to build on Lacazette's goal also smacked of weakness.\nArsenal can justifiably feel aggrieved by a penalty shout that was turned down late on when Danny Welbeck was caught by Matteo Darmian but by that point, the 10 men of United had finally managed to calm a frantic affair.\nWenger's side drop out of the Champions League qualification places into fifth. They were superb going forward at times and will scratch their heads as to how they only found the net once but, not for the first time, it was at the other end where their shortcomings showed up.\nMan of the match - David de Gea\n'Arsenal could not cope' - analysis\nAlan Shearer, BBC Match of the Day pundit\nIt was a magnificent game of football. We have talked about Manchester City going forward but what we saw at times from Manchester United was equally as good.\nThey were just breaking, too quick and too sharp with their pace and their power. They went after Arsenal, put them under pressure and wanted to get behind their defence, and Arsenal could not cope with their one- or two-touch football.\nIt was great to watch, and Manchester United were too good and too clever for Arsenal. Superb.\nOn David de Gea's performance\nI think De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world. He was brilliant.\nOn Paul Pogba's red card\nI think it is a red card. It looks terrible. It was dangerous and he was endangering his opponent.\n'Amazing, phenomenal, fantastic' - reaction\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: \"David de Gea was man of the match by a clear mile.\n\"We played well but there is nothing more frustrating when you have that quality of performance and nothing to show for it at the end. The attitude was impeccable until the end. But you cannot make the mistakes we made at the beginning.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho said: \"I loved the way my team played and fought. Arsenal played in some period amazing attacking football - creating difficulties for us.\n\"But I have to say that my players deserve all the great words. I don't know so many in English but amazing, phenomenal, fantastic. They deserved three points.\"\nDe Gea's unbelievable day - the key stats\nArsenal suffered their first home league defeat since losing 2-1 to Watford in January.\nManchester United have won more Premier League away games at Arsenal than any other side (8).\nDavid de Gea made 14 saves in the game, the joint-most in a Premier League game since 2003-04, when Opta started collecting this data. Vito Mannone and Tim Krul have also made 14 saves in a fixture.\nPaul Pogba has scored four goals and assisted six more in his past nine Premier League appearances.\nAlexandre Lacazette has scored more home goals in the Premier League this season than any other player (six).\nPaul Pogba received his first red card in league competition since May 2013 for Juventus v Palermo\nUp next?\nArsenal will follow Thursday's Europa League home game against BATE Borisov (20:05 GMT) by visiting Southampton on Sunday, 10 December (13:30). Manchester United need a point at home against CSKA Moscow to progress in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45) and then host Manchester City on Sunday, 10 December (16:30)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-1 Southampton\nBournemouth defender Adam Smith said referee Jon Moss admitted he wrongly booked him for diving instead of awarding a penalty during Sunday's 1-1 draw against Southampton.\nWith 32 minutes gone, and the score 0-0, Smith fell to the ground under the challenge of Sofiane Boufal.\nBut, rather than point to the spot, Moss showed Smith his fifth yellow card of the season, which means he will be suspended for one game.\n\"For the ref to book me doesn't help because that's my fifth yellow card of the season,\" said Smith. \"I spoke to him after and he apologised and said it was a penalty.\n\"I don't mind him admitting it but the fact he booked me and can't get it rescinded means I'll miss the next game.\"\nManager Eddie Howe said: \"I can't work out what the referee has seen, but that's football.\"\nBournemouth took the lead just before the break when Scotland winger Ryan Fraser slotted a first-time effort past Fraser Forster.\nBut the Cherries, seeking their first win over the Saints since March 2016, were pegged back when Southampton striker Charlie Austin swept home the equaliser just after the hour mark.\nEngland winger Nathan Redmond - whose post-match conversation with Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola in midweek prompted much discussion - provided the pass for the striker to score after coming on as a half-time substitute.\nThe point takes Southampton up to 11th in the Premier League, while Bournemouth move above Newcastle into 14th.\nHowe's men have league games against Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City coming up in what appears a tough run of matches.\nSaints discover bite after Redmond introduction\nSaints boss Mauricio Pellegrino must have had his reasons to leave Redmond, one of his most influential forwards, out of the starting XI.\nBut bar a couple of half-chances for Austin in the first half, the home defence coped comfortably with what threat the Saints offered.\nThat changed after the break when Redmond replaced James Ward-Prowse. Given a roving role behind Austin, he provided the thrust the visitors had been lacking.\nThe key moment came in the 61st minute when he played a simple pass to Austin, who swept in past Asmir Begovic.\nRedmond also went close with a drive from 20 yards during a second half Southampton largely dominated.\nDoes Forster deserve to go to Russia?\nHad it not been for a brilliant first-half save from Forster, it could have been a different outcome for Southampton.\nThe 29-year-old has been criticised\n, external\nfor some of his displays this season and did not feature in the last England squad.\nHis excellent one-handed save to deny Jermain Defoe was as good as any of David de Gea's lauded stops for Manchester United at Arsenal on Saturday. He then produced another good block to keep out Joshua King's stinging effort after the break.\nThe former Celtic man has made 49 saves in the Premier League this season - more than any other English keeper - and apart from Burnley's Nick Pope he has the best save percentage of any of his rivals for the England squad.\nIf he produces performances of this calibre for the remainder of the season, he will be a strong candidate for a seat on England's plane to Russia.\n'The ref's decision has a knock-on effect' - Howe\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I think it's a clear penalty.\n\"At the time I had a good view of it and I think if the defender doesn't get the ball he's in trouble because he's committed, he's on the floor. Adam goes over his leg.\n\"It's hugely disappointing because not only do we not get the penalty but we lose Adam to suspension and it has a knock-on effect to the next game.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"I think it was a fair result. It was a really tight game. It was a nice derby. Obviously at the end of the first half they were a bit better than us after scoring but our reaction was really positive and for me it was a nice game.\"\nOn the penalty appeal: \"I haven't seen the clip but I understand the reaction of the people because every single action, it is important to take advantage. Now I cannot talk about our players.\"\nMan of the match - Charlie Austin (Southampton)\nAustin in form - the stats\nBournemouth have recorded just one win in their past 10 league meetings with Southampton (W1 D3 L6), winning 2-0 in this fixture in March 2016.\nOnly West Brom (six) have dropped more points from winning positions in home games than Bournemouth (five) in the Premier League this term.\nSouthampton are winless in their past five Premier League away games (D2 L3), and have only won once on the road in the competition this term (1-0 at Crystal Palace).\nSaints have only won one of their past 51 games in the Premier League when trailing at half time (3-2 v Liverpool in March 2016), drawing 11 and losing 39.\nFraser scored his first Premier League goal since 3 January (v Arsenal), ending a run of 24 appearances without finding the net.\nAustin has netted seven goals in his past 10 Premier League starts for Southampton, including three in his past two.\nThis was Austin's 11th goal in the competition for Southampton. He is the only player to score 10 or more for the Saints since his debut in the competition (in January 2016).\nRedmond has provided an assist in each of his past two games at the Vitality Stadium and has equalled his best assist total in a Premier League campaign (three - in 2015-16 and 2013-14).\nOnly Lukasz Fabianski (35) has made more saves than Forster (34) in Premier League away games this season.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and Southampton host Arsenal next Sunday (12:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 West Ham United\nManchester City came from behind to win a record-equalling 13th Premier League match in a row with victory over stubborn West Ham at Etihad Stadium.\nAngelo Ogbonna's header on the stroke of half-time put the lowly Hammers ahead, but Nicolas Otamendi responded with a predatory finish shortly after the break.\nDavid Silva won it for City, acrobatically converting a Kevin de Bruyne pass with seven minutes left.\nVictory meant Pep Guardiola's side re-established their eight-point lead over Manchester United, who they play at Old Trafford next Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nThey also equalled the longest winning run within a top-flight season, matching Sunderland and Preston (1891-92), Arsenal (2001-02) and Chelsea (2016-17).\nWest Ham, though, have set a club record for the fewest points after 15 Premier League matches - they have just 10.\nThe Londoners had their chances - as well as Ogbonna's goal, Michail Antonio almost pounced when Ederson spilled the ball, and Manuel Lanzini forced the goalkeeper to save at his near post.\nBut it always looked as though City's pressure would tell and, shortly after De Bruyne's free-kick was palmed away, Gabriel Jesus skipped through and slid the ball to Otamendi, who scored.\nLeroy Sane, Raheem Sterling, De Bruyne and Jesus had further chances before Silva won it for the home side, but there was still time for the Hammers to go close, with Diafra Sakho shooting just wide after Marko Arnautovic pulled the ball back.\nAnalysis: Total belief, squad unity and late goals - who can stop Man City?\n5 live's Football Daily: Another late goal, another Man City victory\nRelive Manchester City's victory over West Ham\nCity leave it late to win - again\nSilva's strike made this the fourth game in a row City have won thanks to a goal scored in or after the 83rd minute. Sterling had scored the past three, having also hit an injury-time winner at Bournemouth in August.\nA home victory always looked the likeliest result, with City extending their unbeaten run in all competitions to 28 matches.\nThey were made to fight for the points, though, and Silva's late winner was one of 18 shots they had in the second half.\nWhile City have been in full flow for much of the season, they have also shown their resilience - taking a league-high 10 points from losing positions.\nPrior to their late winners against Huddersfield last month and now West Ham, City had won only one of their past 30 games in which they had been behind at half-time.\nThat combination of silk and steel has taken them eight points clear at the top, and it will take something special to stop them.\nPositives in defeat for Moyes\nDespite the defeat, there was plenty for Hammers boss David Moyes to take heart from as his side kept the league leaders at bay for almost an hour.\nThe first half was particularly encouraging and, though a deflected strike from Silva extended Adrian, West Ham had better chances through Antonio and Lanzini.\nThey looked defensively solid and confident in their gameplan, and Moyes' only disappointment will be they could not keep it up.\nJesus' half-time introduction made a difference, but Sane, De Bruyne and Silva - who had not been at their best in the first half - also began to influence things.\nCity had had six shots to the Hammers' four prior to that, but Adrian was forced into a string of saves as the hosts bombarded his goal in search of a winner.\nAdrian, who came in as Joe Hart was unable to face his parent club, was a standout performer but the Hammers had opportunities of their own despite the absence of strikers Andy Carroll and Javier Hernandez.\nAnd the agonising nature of this defeat was summed up by the reaction of former City defender Pablo Zabaleta when Silva's shot hit the back of the net.\n'We deserved to equalise'\nDavid Moyes speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: \"I have to say it was a really good effort. We defended much better today. We've worked a bit on it, we had one day where we could prepare.\n\"We needed our goalkeeper to play well. He got both hands to most things. I thought most of it was outside the box. I have to say we did a really good job.\n\"What a chance we have to make it 2-2 late on. My feeling was I thought we deserved it (to equalise). You get results in different ways and it looked as though we might have got one today. For long parts of the game we were in with a chance.\"\nPep Guardiola speaking to Match of the Day: \"We started really well but we lost our patience. We didn't have any rhythm because Adrian was taking 30 seconds every time.\n\"It was similar to the last few games, in the second half I thought we would score. They played 10 players inside the box, it was almost impossible.\n\"It's a big victory. It showed what we are. We had two strikers in the second half and that helped, it was a big lesson for me. We created more with two.\n\"We spoke a lot about defending set-pieces but they are taller. It will happen again next week against United so we have to try and concede fewer set-pieces.\"\nRecord-equalling success and record-breaking disappointment - the best of the stats\nCity have equalled the longest winning run within a top-flight season.\nCity's haul of 43 points from 15 games is a joint top-flight record, level with Tottenham in 1960-61 (converted to three points for a win).\nWest Ham's total of 10 points from 15 games is their lowest in the Premier League and lowest in the top-flight since 1976-77 (nine, converted to three for a win).\nSince his debut for City in September 2015, De Bruyne has provided 35 assists in the league - more than any other in the big five European leagues.\nJesus has been directly involved in 21 goals in his 24 Premier League appearances so far (15 goals, 6 assists).\nOgbonna scored his first goal in the big five European leagues, in his 144th appearance.\nMan of the match - Adrian\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham return to London Stadium to face Chelsea on Saturday (12:30 GMT) in the first of two successive home games - with Arsenal to come afterwards.\nManchester City travel to Ukraine to take on Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) and return to league action against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday (16:30)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-0 Chelsea\nWest Ham won for the first time under David Moyes as Marko Arnautovic's first goal for the club proved enough to beat a disjointed Chelsea at London Stadium.\nThe Hammers scored the only goal after just six minutes when Arnautovic curled a deft strike into the bottom corner after exchanging passes with Manuel Lanzini on the edge of the area.\nChelsea responded well before the break but were repelled by an organised West Ham defence and two solid saves from Adrian, retaining his spot in place of the dropped Joe Hart.\nBoth sides became increasingly ragged in the second half but West Ham desperately held on, with Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata firing wide when clean through late on.\nDespite victory, the hosts remain in the bottom three, though they have drawn level on points with 17th-placed West Brom, who lost 1-0 to fellow strugglers Swansea later on Saturday.\nDefeat means champions Chelsea will finish the weekend 14 points behind leaders Manchester City if Pep Guardiola's side beat rivals Manchester United on Sunday.\n'If you lose four games in 16 you're not in the race' - Chelsea boss Conte rules out title\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nRelive the action from London Stadium\nThe Moyes revival\nHaving ultimately failed to hang on in a vastly improved performance against Manchester City last weekend, West Ham took the next step in proving they could be revitalised under Moyes by this time beating superior opposition.\nTheir new endeavour was epitomised by Arnautovic, the often frustrating Austria international exchanging positions with his fellow forwards to routinely test Chelsea's defence.\nWhen makeshift centre-forward Michail Antonio drifted out right early on, Arnautovic cleverly moved inside, collecting Antonio's pass and playing a quick one-two with Lanzini to leave Andreas Christensen behind, before calmly finishing low past Thibaut Courtois.\nHe remained a threat even when West Ham dropped deeper and was denied a decent penalty shout when he tried to go past Christensen and the ball hit the Danish defender's outstretched hand.\nAt the other end, the Hammers showed greater resolve in defence, largely due to Moyes' organisation of the central back three and wing-backs, with Arthur Masuaku particularly impressive down the left.\nIt could also be a result of Adrian's more measured presence in goal, exuding more calm to his defence perhaps than the erratic Hart, who could not play against his parent club last week and has now lost his place.\n\"I have two really good goalkeepers - Joe's professionalism when I told him he wasn't playing was excellent, Adrian has done well again and kept the clean sheet so we're happy,\" said Moyes.\nWhatever the main reason, Moyes will surely stick with Adrian going forward and England's number one Hart could find himself short of first-team football before next summer's World Cup.\nThe next test for West Ham is to replicate these performances against the teams around them and drag themselves away from danger.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic (West Ham)\nIs Chelsea's title defence over?\nEven before the halfway mark in the season, it already looks like a second successive Premier League title is beyond Chelsea, who trail the imperious Manchester City by 11 points with the leaders still to play this weekend.\nAntonio Conte's side have now dropped 16 points in as many games, having dropped just 21 in the whole of last season.\nAs with defeats by Burnley and Crystal Palace, they were poor against less-gifted opposition and the Blues attack was largely innocuous throughout.\nAdrian made two fine saves low to his left to keep out N'Golo Kante and David Zappacosta, but both efforts were somewhat speculative and Eden Hazard displayed none of his recent stellar form as he was unable to exploit West Ham's deep line.\nIt took a momentary lapse in concentration by Masuaku to create Chelsea's best chance, as the wing-back played Morata onside only for the Spain striker to pull his shot wide, before Hazard struck over in the closing stages.\nNothing Chelsea did was particularly bad, but neither was it that inspiring - a microcosm of a uneven season in which they look set to be left fighting for second at best.\n'The fans know West Ham are on the way back' - manager reaction\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We're having to stop conceding goals - we have a terrible goals against record - but we've also got people here who can score and cause problems and we've done much better again.\n\"The supporters showed they know West Ham are on their way back and they're showing that the players are putting in the effort.\n\"I'd love to play the way Chelsea play but we can only do so much at a time. We've beaten the champions so it's a great achievement for us and a great three points.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte, speaking to BBC Sport: \"When you lose a game you must be disappointed. Our start was bad but we played a bit tired. To face one game every two days always with the same players is very difficult. And we have just started this period.\n\"We created many chances but were not able to score. We have to go and to play game by game, to be focused. Don't forget in this league it is very difficult. There are six top teams and four go to the Champions League. We have to fight and do our best.\"\nDerbies spell danger for Conte - match stats\nFive of Conte's nine Premier League defeats as Chelsea manager have been in London derbies (Crystal Palace twice, Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham).\nMoyes secured his first Premier League home victory in just under a year since Sunderland beat Watford on 17 December 2016, ending a run of 11 successive league home games without a win (D5 L6).\nArnautovic became the 140th different player to score a Premier League goal for West Ham - only Tottenham (142) have had a higher number of players score for them in the competition.\nArnautovic became the 43rd different player to both score for and against West Ham United in the Premier League - a higher tally than any other club in the competition.\nCourtois has conceded 100 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea in 107 appearances in the competition. It took Petr Cech 172 Premier League appearances to concede 100 goals for the Blues.\nThis was the 100th Premier League win that Mark Noble has played in for the Hammers - the first player to reach this landmark for the club.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Huddersfield on Tuesday, with kick-off at 20:00 GMT, before hosting Southampton on 16 December at 15:00.\nWest Ham host Arsenal on Wednesday at 20:00 and are away to Stoke next Saturday at 15:00."

The first goal came from a training-ground move, with Christopher Schindler flicking on the ball at the near post, while the second saw the ball well recycled after the initial set-piece delivery was cleared.\nWagner's side now have four wins and 14 points from their eight home games so far this season, a run that, were it to continue, would go a long way to ensuring their Premier League survival.\nThe Terriers' run of four straight defeats coincided with a spell of three out of four games on the road - the one home game a narrow 2-1 defeat by Manchester City - and they looked a different side in front of their vocal home support compared to recent away games.\n\"Today was exactly what we need to do at home to be successful,\" Wagner said.\n\"We wanted to be on our front foot and press them high. I think it worked as we kept them away from our goal. The boys were brave and invested everything.\"\nRelive Huddersfield's victory over Brighton\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nBrighton disappoint in defence and attack\nBrighton manager Hughton said before kick-off he had been \"delighted\" with his side's away form in their debut Premier League season, with key victories against West Ham and Swansea on the road.\nAgainst Huddersfield, however, they struggled going forward and were uncharacteristically sloppy at the back for a team who had let in only seven away goals, a record only bettered by league leaders Manchester City and champions Chelsea.\nFor Huddersfield's opener, Schindler was able to win the ball at the near post before Mounie was allowed to finish unmarked, and for the second goal Mathias Jorgensen was unchallenged as he headed Aaron Mooy's cross back towards the Benin international to score.\nThe 36 touches by Brighton's top scorer Glenn Murray were the fewest by any player to play 90 minutes, and only two of those came in the Huddersfield penalty area.\nMurray had Brighton's only other shot on target, another shot from distance, as Huddersfield's organised defensive display denied Hughton's side any space to build attacks through midfield.\n\"We did not play at the level we needed to play but you give them a leg up when you concede the goals we conceded,\" Hughton said.\n\"That allows a good Huddersfield team playing at home to get in a rhythm and that makes the afternoon a very, very tough one.\n\"We were better in the second half and showed more of a threat but they could do it with the security of knowing they had a two-goal lead.\"\nMan of the match - Steve Mounie (Huddersfield)\nBrighton's woes in Huddersfield - the best stats\nHuddersfield have won three of their past four home games in the Premier League, with the only defeat in this run coming against leaders Manchester City.\nThe 2-0 win for Terriers was their first Premier League home victory by more than a one-goal margin.\nBrighton have conceded seven goals in their past two Premier League games, as many they had in their previous nine games in the competition beforehand.\nThis was Brighton's second defeat in as many games at the John Smith's Stadium - at no other away venue have they lost more games in all competitions under Chris Hughton.\nSteve Mounie netted his first Premier League goals since August (two against Crystal Palace), ending a run of nine games without any in the competition.\nMounie is now Huddersfield's top scorer in the Premier League, with two of his four goals coming via headers.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield will test their impressive home performances against the Premier League champions on Tuesday when they host Chelsea (20:00 GMT). Brighton, meanwhile, travel to Wembley to face Tottenham on Wednesday (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-0 Watford\nWatford head coach Marco Silva said Marvin Zeegelaar's red card was \"harsh, harsh, harsh, harsh\", after Scott Arfield's first-half goal gave Burnley victory over the Hornets.\nArfield's winner took Burnley within a point of the Champions League places, but the main talking point was Zeegelaar's 39th-minute dismissal.\nThe Ajax academy graduate was shown a straight red card by referee Lee Probert for a two-footed challenge on Steven Defour.\nSilva described it as \"the decision that influenced the whole of the match\".\n\"We had to compete the rest of the game 10 men against 11,\" he added. \"It was an unfair game then as a result.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, though, supported the decision.\n\"It was definitely a red card,\" he said. \"I thought so at the time. I've seen it afterwards and it's a poor challenge.\"\nProbert had a number of tricky decisions to make - angering Watford by turning down two second-half penalty appeals.\n\"I don't want to talk here about the referee but I think everyone understands his big influence on the match,\" Silva added.\nHe upset the home fans too, ruling out an Ashley Barnes goal with just under 20 minutes left as the striker was judged marginally offside.\nRelive Burnley 1-0 Watford as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nProbert pushed to the limit\nIn a match that had plenty of bite, Probert was the centre of attention - and Silva was not impressed.\nMatch of the Day commentator Steve Wilson felt Probert was right to dismiss Zeegelaar - but former Republic of Ireland international Kevin Kilbane felt the defender's feet were too low for it be dangerous play.\n\"Zeegelaar goes low, hurling himself forward, but that doesn't look like a red-card offence,\" Kilbane said on the BBC's Final Score. Watford keeper Heurelho Gomes, meanwhile, called the dismissal \"harsh\".\nProbert was tested several times in the second half. He said no to both of Watford's penalty appeals, first when Andre Carrillo went down under James Tarkowski's tackle, then when Richarlison went to ground after Phil Bardsley's challenge.\nFurther controversy came at the other end, with Barnes ruled offside as he swept in after Arfield's pass was deflected off Tom Cleverley. Probert ruled out the goal after consulting with his assistant. This time it was Burnley's turn to feel hard done by.\nThere was more to come. When Bardsley caught Richarlison late in the closing stages, Silva ran across the front of his technical area, waving his arms in anger, and had to be told to calm down by the referee - who was probably glad to blow the final whistle.\nBurnley continue to overcome injury problems\nThe fact Arfield scored the winner was of great satisfaction for Burnley as he was the player brought into the starting line-up to replace Robbie Brady, who may miss the rest of the season with a knee injury.\nIt was a lovely goal too, slotted in after Jeff Hendrick dummied Johann Gudmundsson's low cross to open up space.\nBurnley's squad now has such depth their progress was not checked by the loss of a player they paid \u00a313m for last January.\n\"The marvel of our squad is that we have players who can come into the team out of the blue and deliver great performances,\" said Dyche.\nGudmundsson and Defour shared set-piece duties with Brady absent, and the Iceland midfielder almost scored with a first-half free-kick that Gomes did well to push around the post.\nBurnley are getting used to coping with long-term injuries now, having been without England goalkeeper Tom Heaton since September with a shoulder injury.\nNick Pope, Heaton's stand-in for the past three months, made an important first-half save from Abdoulaye Doucoure's snapshot, but was otherwise rarely troubled.\nThat was thanks to the defence in front of him, with Kevin Long performing well as he made his first league start of the season, in place of injured captain Ben Mee.\nContinue like this, and Burnley may yet bring European football to Turf Moor. That would be an extraordinary achievement for Dyche - and would only compound the mystery as to why he has not been snapped up by another club.\nHornets draw a rare blank\nBefore arriving at Turf Moor, Watford had scored at least twice in every away game this season - and looked as if they might continue that run as they dominated the first 15 minutes.\nRicharlison turned over Carrillo's bouncing cross in the seventh minute, and had that gone in, the visitors may well have gone on to win.\nKilbane's assertion that Zeegelaar's sending-off changed the game had merit up to a point, although Burnley had managed to work their way back into the match by then.\nIn any case, Watford continued to create half-chances even with 10 men. Janmaat's positive run soon after half-time was only thwarted by Defour's timely challenge, while Carrillo took too long to shoot after Richarlison had chested into his path, and Jack Cork whipped the ball away.\nAndre Gray, signed for a club record \u00a318m from Burnley in August, made only a brief substitute appearance against his former club, and was unable to make an impact.\nThere was not an awful lot to choose between the two sides in the end - and despite defeat here, Watford look more than capable of a first top-10 finish in the top division since 1987.\nMan of the match - Johann Gudmundsson (Burnley)\n'One-nil to the Burnley men' - the key stats\nThis was Burnley's 34th Premier League win and the 25th of those to have been won by a single goal margin (74%).\nThere have only been nine goals scored in eight Premier League games at Turf Moor this season (six for Burnley, three for their opponents) - fewer than at any other ground.\nThree of the eight red cards to have been given before half-time this season in the Premier League have come against Burnley.\nWatford have now been given seven red cards in the Premier League since the start of 2016-17; no side have more (they are level with West Ham).\nArfield scored his fifth Premier League goal - the fourth of which has been scored at Turf Moor.\nThe only Canadians to have scored more Premier League goals than Arfield (five) are Tomasz Radzinski (35) and Junior Hoilett (13).\n'We deserved more from the game' - reaction\nWatford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes: \"It was a very harsh decision on the red card and we deserved more from the game as we fought to the end.\n\"We had some good opportunities and could easily have scored, but sometimes the game is like this.\n\"We now need to try to get back to winning ways again, but it's entirely up to us. We are having a great season and believe in our own quality.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"I'm really pleased with the result. Watford had a very strong start to the season and we knew they're a strong side. We started slowly but overall delivered a strong performance.\n\"It's strange when the opposition go a man down because you're then in a fight where everyone expects you to win. But overall this is another big three points for us.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley attempt to continue their push towards the top four at home to Stoke on Tuesday (19:45 GMT), while Watford go to Crystal Palace on the same night (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 Stoke City\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino challenged his players to consistently show their \"true quality\" after an emphatic win over Stoke City at Wembley.\nHarry Kane scored twice as Spurs scored four second-half goals to climb above Arsenal into fifth in the Premier League table.\nIt ended a four-game run without a league win, and Pochettino is demanding his side show the same consistency between now and the end of the season.\n\"That is how we need to play from now,\" said the Argentine, after Spurs scored five for the first time this season.\n\"Consistency between now and the end of the season is so important if we want to finish in the top four. The team showed their true quality.\"\nSpurs went ahead when Potters skipper Ryan Shawcross inadvertently diverted the ball past his own keeper - before three goals in the space of 12 minutes put the game out of sight.\nSon Heung-min doubled the lead and Kane's header made it 3-0.\nKane drilled home the fourth, and Son set up Christian Eriksen for the fifth goal before Shawcross headed a late consolation.\nPochettino admitted Tottenham's Champions League campaign had been a distraction.\nBut with Spurs, who finished above Real Madrid in the group stage, not due to play in Europe again until February, he is hoping his side can concentrate on their domestic form.\n\"Last season we were frustrated because we were very good in the Premier League but we were a disaster in the Champions League,\" he added.\n\"This season the team was so determined to show they can compete in the Champions League and when you mix with the Premier League, that maybe was a bit of a distraction.\n\"But now we can only be focused on the Premier League and winning games.\"\nStoke, meanwhile, have won only once in seven league games and drop to 15th, three points above the relegation zone.\nThey are the first club in Premier League history to lose to the same opponent by four goals or more in four consecutive meetings.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nSpurs warming to Wembley\nSince demolishing Liverpool 4-1 in October, Spurs had won just once in six Premier League games.\nTheir Wembley troubles have been well documented, but this was a match during which it all came together.\nSon has been the one shining light during a poor run in the league, and the South Korean was once again a driving force as Spurs scored more than once in a Premier League match at Wembley for only the second time this season.\nIt was his low cross which led to Shawcross putting into his own net, and he scored the second goal and set up the fifth.\nAfter throwing away points against Burnley, Swansea and West Brom at Wembley, Tottenham were at their ruthless best.\nAnd they could have scored more but for Stoke keeper Jack Butland.\nThe England international produced two fine stops in the dying minutes to keep out Eriksen, who was making his 200th appearance for the club, and Kane as the Potters were completely overrun.\nMore capital punishment for Stoke\nThis was an embarrassing defeat at the national stadium for Stoke, who have now lost three of their past four league games.\nThese are worrying times for Potters boss Mark Hughes, whose side started well but capitulated after half-time.\nKane missed a glorious chance at 1-0 and Butland almost gifted the England striker a goal after losing control of the ball inside his own penalty area.\nHaving let in four at home to Chelsea and another seven at Manchester City, Stoke are conceding at a rate of more than two goals a game.\nThey have failed to win on their past 16 league trips to London, conceding 37 goals and taking six points from a possible 48 since beating Spurs at White Hart Lane in November 2014.\n\"It's not good enough doing OK just for 45 minutes,\" said Hughes. \"We couldn't deal with Tottenham's power and pace. We struggled in one-on-one situations, we needed to get tighter.\n\"Today will damage our confidence. That is the worry for us.\"\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\nSix own goals for Shawcross - the stats\nShawcross scored the sixth own goal of his Premier League career - only Richard Dunne (10), Martin Skrtel and Jamie Carragher (seven each) have scored more in the competition.\nThis was the first time a Stoke player had ever scored at both ends in a Premier League game.\nKane has scored eight Premier League goals against Stoke, only against Leicester City has he scored more in the competition (nine).\nKane scored his 90th Premier League goal in just his 131st game - only Alan Shearer (113 games) did so quicker.\nThis was Stoke's 1000th top-flight defeat, making them the 15th side to reach that figure since its inception in 1888-89.\nWhat's next?\nSpurs return to Wembley on Wednesday when Brighton are the visitors for a league game (kick-off 20:00 GMT), before Mauricio Pochettino's side visit leaders Manchester City next Saturday (17:30).\nStoke are back on the road on Tuesday when they travel to Burnley in the Premier League (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-2 Bournemouth\nChristian Benteke went against manager Roy Hodgson's orders to take the injury-time penalty he missed in Crystal Palace's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth.\nCherries goalkeeper Asmir Begovic pushed away Benteke's weak effort as a rollercoaster encounter ended with the points shared.\nPalace boss Hodgson said: \"It was a unilateral decision, no-one on our team was able to wrest the ball from him.\"\nThe visitors had taken the lead when Jermain Defoe fired low into the bottom corner from Andrew Surman's cross.\nBut Palace roared back with two goals in three minutes.\nLuka Milivojevic, who initially lined up the injury-time spot-kick, buried a penalty awarded for a foul on Wilfried Zaha, before Scott Dann steered home Yohan Cabaye's ball across the face of goal.\nDefoe's second - a superb, dipping half-volley - sent the teams to the break even.\nRelive a frenetic encounter at Selhurst Park\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nThere were no goals in the second half, but no let-up in the entertainment either.\nPalace finished the stronger, with Dann stabbing over and Benteke squandering his chance from 12 yards.\nBut even as the final whistle blew, Bournemouth were appealing in vain for a penalty.\nThe result, combined with Swansea's win, means Palace return to the bottom of the Premier League table.\nPlenty of effort, less execution\nPalace's Premier League season began with seven straight defeats. Bournemouth started with four successive losses.\nBoth have since improved markedly and, if they replicate the appetite for the fight on display here, they are well prepared to resist relegation.\nWith Hodgson giving Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha licence to roam far and wide, there will be plenty of other teams that struggle to pin down the Palace attack this season.\nAnd the former England manager will feel that, having managed 24 shots at goal to Bournemouth's 11, his side should have converted their pressure into points.\nBut his inquest will begin with Benteke's decision to take on penalty responsibilities at the death after Milivojevic had emphatically converted in the first half.\nThe Belgian's run-up lacked conviction and culminated in a tentative shot that was pushed away by Begovic. The \u00a327m striker is yet to score in 11 games this season.\n\"We the management decide who the penalty takers are and we don't expect players to change those decisions during the course of the game,\" Hodgson added.\n\"We tried to shout out our instructions, they obviously didn't reach the penalty spot.\"\nDefoe continues to adapt and thrive\nWhen Defoe returned to English football from MLS side Toronto FC three years ago, there were plenty who questioned whether the then 32-year-old still could cut it at the top level.\nThirty-four league goals for a Sunderland side that was relegated at the end of last season answered that question.\nWith 35 years on the clock, the electric pace that was once the bedrock of his game has gone. Here, James Tomkins, who would not have had a chance of reeling him in a decade ago, was able to get back and make a tackle when it seemed Defoe was clean through in the first half.\nBut Defoe's technique is still very much intact. If his first was an assured first-time finish, his second was simply sublime.\nThere seemed little danger as he chased a bouncing ball towards the byeline, but Defoe swivelled suddenly to unleash a shot over a startled Julian Speroni, under the crossbar and into the far corner from a tight angle.\nHis 200th and 201st league goals come 17 years and two months after his first - scored in a third-tier match for the Cherries in October 2000, during his first stint at the club.\nZaha to come under the microscope?\nEverton forward Oumar Niasse became the first Premier League player banned for diving when he was found guilty of \"exaggerating the effect of normal contact\" to win a penalty against Palace last month.\nPalace were the wronged on that occasion, but could be in the dock themselves after Zaha went down to win his team's first penalty.\nNeither the backtracking Nathan Ake nor the advancing Begovic seemed to make significant contact with the Ivory Coast international before he hit the turf.\nEven with repeated replays, it was difficult to untangle whether there was any deliberate attempt to trick the official however, underlining the difficulty of such cases.\nMan of the match - Jermain Defoe\n'He's put himself in a bit of a black hole' - manager quotes\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson on the injury-time penalty: \"We expected Luka to take it, he's our designated penalty taker.\n\"For some reason Christian persuaded him to let him take it, and then he missed it.\n\"I think Christian is stunned, shocked and very disappointed.\n\"But I actually thought he played well, that's the best I've seen him play in a Palace shirt in my time here.\n\"It's a great disappointment. Rather than crown that performance he's put himself in a bit of a black hole with Palace supporters because he's missed.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe on Jermain Defoe's goals: \"They were two really good finishes.\n\"They are totally different finishes as well.\n\"For the second, from that angle he's got no right to score, and that's his unique talent.\"\nMatch stats - Benteke's 40% conversion rate\nBenteke has missed three of his five penalties for Crystal Palace in the Premier League, including each of the past two.\nPalace have drawn three consecutive games in the Premier League for the first time since May 2005, when they were managed by Iain Dowie.\nBournemouth have dropped 10 points from winning positions in the Premier League this term; a joint-high alongside Watford and West Brom (also 10).\nDefoe has netted nine goals in his past 10 league appearances against Palace, scoring in each of his past three games at Selhurst Park.\nDefoe has scored twice in each of his past three Premier League appearances against Palace; his longest such run against a single opponent.\nThere were just seven minutes and nine seconds between Palace equalising (Milivojevic), going 2-1 ahead (Dann) and Bournemouth making it 2-2 (Defoe).\nDann is the first central defender to score in four consecutive Premier League games against the same opponent.\nBournemouth's opener was their first goal in the opening 10 minutes of a Premier League game this season.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace play Watford at home on Tuesday before playing Leicester on Saturday.

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-0 West Bromwich Albion\nSwansea City hauled themselves off the bottom of the Premier League table as captain Wilfried Bony's emphatic late finish gave them a precious win over West Brom to ease the pressure on head coach Paul Clement.\nThe out-of-form sides seemed paralysed by tension in a first half almost entirely devoid of any meaningful action until the visitors' Jake Livermore headed against his own post.\nSwansea tried admirably to raise the tempo after the interval, with Ivory Coast striker Bony inspiring his side with a determined run and shot that was narrowly wide.\nThe hosts' search for a winner seemed set to end in vain but with nine minutes left a loose ball from a corner fell invitingly for Bony, who blasted it through a crowd of bodies to earn the Swans a first victory since October.\nThey would however have remained bottom had Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke not had his last-minute penalty saved in the Eagles' 2-2 draw with Bournemouth.\nSwansea are now a point behind West Brom and safety, providing a huge lift to Clement, whose position had been under intense scrutiny of late.\nThis was West Brom's 14th Premier League game without victory and consigned manager Alan Pardew to a first defeat in his second game in charge.\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nPremier League stats - with Moyes, Kane, Defoe and Benteke\nPressure on Clement eases\nDecember has been an unhappy month for Swansea managers in recent years, with Bob Bradley sacked this time last year and Garry Monk shown the door 12 months earlier.\nFormer Bayern Munich assistant manager Clement was on thin ice himself, having collected just one point from his previous seven Premier League games.\nIn the days leading up to the game he defiantly insisted he was the man to transform Swansea's fortunes, having done so last season with a remarkable escape from relegation.\nBut this campaign has largely been a tale of misery, with the most damning statistic perhaps the fact the Swans had lost more matches (10) than they had scored goals (eight) in 15 Premier League fixtures.\nTheir 27 shots on target from 15 league matches was at least 10 fewer than any other team in Europe's top five divisions and a turgid start to this encounter suggested at further limited action.\nTheir best effort in the first half came when Alfie Mawson headed narrowly over from close range.\nThere was more urgency to Swansea's display in the second half, with Bony's low drive wide and Jordan Ayew's effort saved by Ben Foster giving the agitated home supporters reason to believe their side might be able to force a first win since October.\nTheir perseverance paid dividends as Bony clinically pounced on a loose ball in the West Brom penalty area to revive Swansea hopes of surviving another season in the top flight.\nPardew's Baggies underwhelm\nOn his last visit to the Liberty Stadium a little over a year ago, Pardew's Crystal Palace team were beaten 5-4 by a Swansea side managed by American Bradley in a wildly entertaining encounter.\nThat brilliant chaos could not have been in more stark contrast to this match, which was an undercooked suet pudding of a spectacle.\nIf his predecessor Tony Pulis was watching, he would have been forgiven for feeling aggrieved about his sacking, considering his pragmatic brand of football was believed to be one of the contributing factors to his departure.\nPardew promised to \"free up\" the West Brom side when he was appointed but there was little evidence of a more expansive outlook in Wales.\nThe Baggies offered next to no attacking threat at the Liberty Stadium, their best chance falling to Salomon Rondon, who headed over the bar shortly after the visitors had fallen behind.\nThat was the visitors' best opportunity to equalise and indeed West Brom could have conceded a second had Tammy Abraham not chipped his injury-time chance wide.\nThat scoreline might have flattered the hosts but they deserved their victory having shown far more attacking intent in an encounter few neutrals will remember.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Bony\n'Players gave everything'- manager reaction\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: \"It was a really important result today. As everyone knows we have been struggling for form and performances and results have not been good enough. The players have given everything today.\n\"There has been frustration in the club that we have not performed how we are capable of. But we did what was needed to be done. The timing of the goal put us in a great position.\"\nWest Brom manager Alan Pardew: \"I think we deserved something as the away side. We struggled to create clear-cut chances but we had a great few chances on the break. We didn't take them and lacked a bit of conviction. There was nothing between the two teams really.\n\"We can't question the commitment. We just need that bit of quality. That final moment, final pass or decision, it just let us down.\"\nBony rolls the clock back - key stats\nThe Swans ended a run of seven Premier League games without a win (D1 L6).\nThe Baggies are now winless in their last 14 Premier League matches (D7 L7), their longest run in the top flight since a 16-game streak between February 2006 and August 2008.\nWilfried Bony has scored two goals in his last two Premier League games - as many as he had in his previous 28 in the competition.\nIt's the first time the Ivory Coast striker has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances since December 2014.\nSwansea had three shots on target in this match - only twice have they managed more in a Premier League game this season (four vs Newcastle and Leicester).\nAfter having the first shot on target in the 22nd minute, the Baggies didn't register another one in the entire match.\nUp next?\nBoth sides take on in-form sides on Wednesday as Swansea host league leaders Manchester City and West Brom travel to Liverpool."

It is sometimes a lack of experience.\"\nLeicester's win was their third in a row in the Premier League - a run that has taken them up to eighth in the table.\nThe Foxes had made a terrible start as their hosts - roared on by a vocal home crowd following pre-game celebrations to mark the club's 125th anniversary - took the lead in the sixth minute courtesy of Joselu's close-range finish.\nThe visitors rallied quickly and restored parity when Mikel Merino's loose pass gave them possession and began an attack that Riyad Mahrez ended with a superb 25-yard, left-footed drive into the top corner.\nDemarai Gray put them in front after the break with a shot that found the net via a deflection off Florian Lejeune before Dwight Gayle levelled matters with a shot that came off Harry Maguire, but City would have the final word.\nIt was an excellent victory for Claude Puel's side, who have now earned 17 points from eight league games since Craig Shakespeare was sacked in October.\nDefeat represents the first time Benitez - who has previously managed Liverpool and Chelsea - has suffered three straight Premier League home losses.\nLeicester continue upward trajectory\nWhen Puel was appointed by Leicester, the team were 14th in the Premier League with just two wins from nine games.\nThe Frenchman had his doubters, who pointed - somewhat unfairly - to the 2016-17 season he spent in charge of Southampton, who he led to an eighth-placed finish and the EFL Cup final, but was accused of producing uninspiring football.\nCity's seven games under him have yielded both points and goals, with their only defeat at the hands of league leaders Manchester City.\nOn Saturday they recovered from two setbacks - one early in the game, one late - and played the more cohesive, attacking football of the two sides en route to a reward they deserved for their 63% possession and greater number of efforts on goal.\nIn Mahrez, Gray and Jamie Vardy they have an incisive attacking trio who will trouble any defence in the league and one seemingly restored to their potent best by their new boss.\nMahrez has been directly involved in eight goals in 16 appearances in the Premier League this season (four goals and four assists), which is just one fewer than in 36 games last season, when he managed six goals and three assists.\nGray has netted three goals in seven Premier League appearances since Puel took charge, having scored just once in his first 50 games in the competition.\nVardy was unfortunate not to add to his tally - which now stands at seven goals in 14 league games - but it was he who provided the cross towards Okazaki that forced Perez into his game-deciding error.\n\"[We had a] fantastic, positive attitude,\" Puel said. \"\n\"It is difficult. After a good first half our start to the second half was not enough. We came back with the second goal. It was a fantastic move and a fantastic goal. We deserved this result and now it is important to continue from this result.\n\"It is a fantastic feeling at the end with the third goal and we deserved it.\"\nAnniversary woes for Newcastle\nIn their 125-year history - a milestone they reached this week and celebrated before kick-off on Saturday evening with some impressive stadium-wide flag-waving - Newcastle have experienced notable highs, most notably a hat-trick of FA Cups in the 1950s.\nBut if they are to avoid this season ending in another significant low they must arrest a run of form that has now seen them fail to win in seven top-flight games, since a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace in October.\nIn his programme notes, Newcastle manager Benitez referred to this week's celebrations, calling on his players to \"use all that positivity around the stadium and city to support the players and give us the best chance of getting three points\".\nThey got off to the best possible start thanks to an incisive link-up between forwards Gayle and Joselu.\nThe latter has come in for some criticism from Newcastle fans as a result of his inconsistent form since joining from Stoke in the summer for \u00a35m but he showed good awareness to hold his run, in order to collect Gayle's cut-back, and precision to slot home the game's opening goal from near the penalty spot.\nAfter Mahrez and Gray had swung the game back in the visitors' favour during a lengthy period of away dominance, Newcastle demonstrated a fighting attitude to get back into the game.\nHowever, for the third home game running they would have nothing to show for their efforts, with this defeat following on from the demoralising losses to Bournemouth and Watford.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Leicester)\nNewcastle can't hold on to a lead - the stats you need to know\nNewcastle have dropped 11 points from winning positions in the Premier League this term; the most of any team in the competition.\nRafa Benitez's side are winless in seven Premier League games (W0 D1 L6) and have conceded 15 goals across their last five matches in the competition (an average of three per game).\nDwight Gayle has scored more than a quarter of Newcastle United's 101 league goals since the start of 2016-17 (26/101).\nFour of Riyad Mahrez's last seven goals in the Premier League have come from outside the box, including both of his last two.\nMahrez has been directly involved in eight goals in 16 appearances in the Premier League this season (four goals and four assists); just one fewer than in 36 games last season (six goals and three assists).\nDemarai Gray has netted three goals in seven Premier League appearances since Claude Puel took charge, after scoring just once in his first 50 games in the competition.\nJoselu's fourth-minute goal was Newcastle's fastest in a Premier League game since Loic Remy's in November 2013 (second minute v Norwich).\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Everton - managed by former boss Sam Allardyce - in the Premier League on Wednesday (19:45 GMT), while Leicester travel to Puel's former club Southampton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Arsenal\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger said his side's slow start in games is becoming a problem, after they scraped a draw against Southampton.\nSubstitute Olivier Giroud glanced in a superb late header to salvage a point after the Gunners had trailed since the third minute.\n\"In the last two weeks unfortunately we are losing points after a bad start,\" said Wenger, who saw his side concede twice in the first 11 minutes of the 3-1 defeat by Manchester United eight days previously.\n\"I felt the Manchester United game played a bit of a part in the head of our defenders,\" he said.\n\"They were a bit apprehensive to start well again and that's why it is sometimes not good to talk about the problem because you create a bigger one.\"\nCharlie Austin clipped home an early opener for the home side with the away defence mere onlookers.\nThe Southampton striker drilled a stinging shot into Petr Cech's gloves shortly after, then hit the post from an offside position.\nA sharp save from Aaron Ramsey apart, Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster had little to do as the visitors struggled to carve out clear-cut chances before Giroud climbed above Virgil van Dijk to steer home Alexis Sanchez's cross and make Arsenal's possession finally pay.\nPodcast: Is the Premier League title race over?\nRelive the action from St Mary's\nSouthampton were left to rue several wasted chances on the counter attack, with Ryan Bertrand missing a fine opportunity and Oriol Romeu's long-range effort glancing off the bar in the second half.\nA draw briefly moved Arsenal level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool, but the Reds edged back a point clear with a 1-1 draw against Everton.\nSouthampton broke into the top half of the table, until Everton's point meant the Saints slipped back to 11th.\nHistory repeats on Arsenal\nWenger made one change from the line-up that started with so many errors against Manchester United, but Per Mertesacker's inclusion did not remove that flaw at St Mary's.\nThe German centre-back gave possession away cheaply and was made to pay as Dusan Tadic's cute reverse ball picked out Austin, who clinically found the net.\nIt could easily have been worse for the Gunners in the opening 10 minutes too, as the visiting defence lacked any cohesion or organisation collectively.\nIndividually, Mertesacker, Laurent Koscielny and Nacho Monreal failed to track runners or show the commitment of the Saints attackers.\nJust as against United, Arsenal spent plenty of time on the ball in the second half, with 70% possession after the break - but moments of real concern for the Southampton defence were rare before Giroud's equaliser.\nThe Frenchman's celebration, pointing to the name on the back of his shirt, might have been a reminder to his manager that he is available from the start.\nHe has scored four league goals in 13 substitute appearances during this campaign yet is still to make his first start.\nWenger said afterwards that he considered Giroud \"a regular player\" with \"the right attitude and ability\".\nA goal every 80 minutes from Austin\nLike Giroud, Austin is another striker making a case for more game time.\nThe 28-year-old, in only his third league start of the season, showed the clinical finishing touch the Saints lacked in scoring only nine goals in their opening 12 games.\nAfter clipping over Cech for the opener, he brought a good save from the Arsenal goalkeeper and hit the post from an offside position as he ran the Gunners ragged in the opening 10 minutes.\nHe has spent much of the season behind Shane Long and Manolo Gabbiadini in Saints boss Mauricio Pellegrino's thoughts, but eight goals in his past 11 league starts and an overall strike rate of a goal every 80 minutes in this season's top flight are a robust case for his inclusion.\nIndeed, if it continues, England manager Gareth Southgate might yet take note with a view to next summer's World Cup.\nSaints fans can look on sunny side\nSince beating Everton convincingly at the end of November, the Saints have been a matter of seconds away from taking a point from Manchester City and came from behind to do so at Bournemouth.\nAs at Etihad Stadium against City, their concentration and discipline lapsed towards the end, but Southampton did not rely only on defensive doggedness for their point.\nThey were lively and inventive in attack throughout, with Tadic always looking for an incisive pass and Nathan Redmond providing a quick outlet.\nThe Saints have lost once in their past four games, yet won only once in their past seven matches.\nThis performance was one to convince Saints fans to look on the sunny side of those statistics.\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg\n'We paid a price for slow start' - manager quotes\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"When you play against Arsenal you need to be 100% excellent at almost everything.\n\"We didn't control the ball much but we controlled the game. We had to reduce the space because they have quality in key areas, we competed well but it's a pity we conceded at the end.\n\"We are upset about that but it's part of football. Against Arsenal, in one action, everything can change.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a difficult game and I felt that we paid a heavy price for a slow start. We kept going. Overall, I think the spirit was great. We were relentless to the end.\n\"I consider Olivier Giroud as a regular player. We have to be grateful that he is part of a great team and one who can come on and make a difference with the right attitude and ability. He is a talent.\"\nAustin off the radar and on the scoresheet - match stats\nAustin has scored in all three of his Premier League appearances against Arsenal.\nSince the start of 2014-15, only five Englishmen have scored more Premier League goals than Austin (30).\nNo player has scored more substitute goals for a single Premier League team than Giroud - level with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Man Utd (17).\nOnly Jermain Defoe (23) has scored more substitute goals overall in the competition than Giroud (17).\nTadic provided his 26th assist for Southampton in the Premier League - only Matt le Tissier (64) has more for the club in the competition.\nArsenal have conceded 32 Premier League goals away from home in 2017. Only West Ham (35) and Stoke and Watford (33 each) have shipped more.\nSouthampton have only lost one of their past seven home Premier League games against Arsenal (winning two and drawing four).\nNo team has gained more points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than Arsenal (10 - level with Manchester City).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton welcome former manager Claude Puel and his new side Leicester to St Mary's on Wednesday. Arsenal travel to London rivals West Ham on the same night."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 1-1 Everton\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp accused referee Craig Pawson of \"opening the door\" for Everton to take a point against his dominant side in the Merseyside derby.\nEverton captain Wayne Rooney equalised from the spot after Pawson ruled Dejan Lovren's push on Dominic Calvert-Lewin was worthy of a penalty.\nLiverpool took the lead through Mohamed Salah's sublime curling finish from an angle towards the end of the first half, which was deserved reward for the command shown by Klopp's in-form side.\nSadio Mane wasted a fine opportunity to double the lead before Everton, who had only one shot on target from open play, were awarded the 77th-minute penalty.\nPodcast: Is the Premier League title race over?\nAll the reaction from Anfield\n\"Calvert-Lewin is smart and takes a step but even then it's nothing,\" said an angry Klopp in a bad-tempered interview with Sky Sports.\n\"The referees don't understand that the player is doing that.\n\"I cannot believe in a game like this when only one team is trying to win it and the other team were never in our box, and then you give it, you open the door for them like this.\n\"In my understanding, it's not a penalty.\"\nKlopp then argued with the reporter, saying: \"We can stop the interview, because I only want to speak with someone who has a little bit of understanding of football.\"\nThe German later apologised to the interviewer, and Everton boss Sam Allardyce saw the penalty decision entirely differently.\n\"He can moan all he wants but it's a penalty,\" said Allardyce. \"It's an extremely brave decision and I think he got the decision right.\"\nLiverpool remain fourth in the Premier League table, two points behind third-placed Chelsea, while Everton stay 10th.\nLiverpool must look at themselves\nLovren and captain Jordan Henderson angrily remonstrated with the referee at the final whistle after he awarded the visitors their first penalty at Anfield since 1988.\nLiverpool clearly felt it was a soft decision, yet the hosts must also look at themselves for their inability to secure victory after failing to turn their long spells of possession into more than one goal.\nThey remain unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions but this will feel like a defeat for Klopp, whose team selection will also come under scrutiny.\nThe German opted to start Philippe Coutinho, who scored a Champions League hat-trick in midweek against Spartak Moscow, and fellow Brazilian Roberto Firmino on the bench.\nInstead Klopp handed 20-year-old striker Dominic Solanke his second league start for the club, while there was an all-English midfield of Henderson, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n\"I make decisions that I think are right,\" added Klopp. \"We lived more or less in their box. We could have scored earlier. I have to live with that.\"\nKlopp made six changes in total yet Liverpool's play was still fluent, even if they were frustrated by the visitors before a brilliant piece of individual skill by Salah put them ahead.\nThe Egypt forward took his tally for the club since signing in the summer to 19 goals with an exquisite finish after beating Cuco Martina and holding off Idrissa Gueye.\nHowever, Mane's selfish decision not to pass to a team-mate cost Liverpool the cushion of a second goal before the interval.\nHe ran clear of the Everton defence but instead of squaring to Solanke, Oxlade-Chamberlain or Salah he went for goal and dragged his shot wide of the right-hand post.\nLiverpool's failure to add another goal ultimately cost them a fourth successive win, as Everton secured a point from a game they never had control of.\nAs Klopp sought to engineer a late winner for his side he sent on Danny Ings for the injury-plagued striker's first Premier League appearance since May 2016.\nRooney and Allardyce come up trumps\nEverton remain without a win at Anfield since 1999 yet this was a result to enjoy for the blue half of Merseyside.\nThe Toffees managed just two shots on target and spent most of the first half camped inside their own half as Liverpool dominated possession and territory.\nIn fact, Everton had 21% of the possession, their lowest figure ever in a Premier League match since 2003-04 (when Opta started recording the share).\nLiverpool midfielder Henderson completed 60 passes - six more than Everton's players put together - in the opening 45 minutes alone.\nYet Allardyce's side dug deep to stay in the game, and when the chance arose to beat keeper Simon Mignolet, the goal was meaningful.\nRooney's first goal in six appearances in this fixture extends his side's unbeaten run to four games in all competitions.\nThe 32-year-old, whose pass led to the penalty, had been eagerly awaiting the derby since rejoining his boyhood club from Manchester United in July.\nRooney remains without a win in the derby but his spot-kick - straight down the middle after Mignolet dived early - at least earned his side a point to savour.\n\"The object of the exercise was to frustrate the opposition,\" added Allardyce.\n\"Clear-cut chances for Liverpool were very few and far between for such a talented team. When I arrived at Everton we'd conceded 13 goals in the past four games.\n\"We've conceded one goal in four games since. Our platform for success is being built from the foundations and that's extremely important if we are to move up the league.\"\nMan of the match - Jonjoe Kenny (Everton)\nWhy Rooney loves facing Liverpool - the stats\nRooney has scored five goals in his past six Premier League starts against Liverpool.\nThe Everton captain has been directly involved in five goals in his past three Premier League games (four goals, one assist), one more than he managed in his previous 11 with Everton this season.\nSalah has scored 19 goals in 24 appearances for Liverpool this season (all competitions), as many as he netted for Roma last term in 41 games.\nSalah has been directly involved in 23 goals for Liverpool in all competitions this season, two more than any other player in the Premier League.\nLiverpool have equalled their longest-ever unbeaten run against Everton in all competitions - 15 games - set between March 1972 and April 1978.\nEverton have lost just one of their past six Premier League games (W3 D2), after losing six of the eight before that (W1 D1).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are back at Anfield on Wednesday when they host struggling West Brom in the Premier League (20:00 GMT), while Allardyce takes Everton back to his former club Newcastle on the same night (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-2 Manchester City\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho said his side's title hopes are \"probably\" over because referee Michael Oliver failed to award them a penalty in their 2-1 loss to \"lucky\" Manchester City.\nPep Guardiola's team stretched their lead at the top of the table to 11 points and became the first team to win 14 successive English top-flight games in a single season.\nCity took the lead their vast superiority deserved when man-of-the-match David Silva hooked home from close range after confusion at a corner on 42 minutes, only for United to be handed a lifeline in first-half stoppage time when poor defending from Nicolas Otamendi and Fabian Delph allowed Marcus Rashford to steal in for a composed finish.\nOtamendi made amends nine minutes after the break when Romelu Lukaku - who had a poor game - lashed at a clearance in the area and the City defender pounced on the rebound to score.\nHas Mourinho lost the battle with Guardiola?\nMy Barcelona philosophy is working in England - Guardiola\nMourinho's post-match focus centred on an incident in the 79th minute, when Ander Herrera went down in the box under a challenge from Otamendi and was booked for diving.\n\"My first reaction is I feel sorry for Michael Oliver because he had a very good match but unfortunately he made an important mistake,\" Mourinho told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"The result was made with a big penalty not given. That would have been 2-2.\n\"Michael was unlucky because it was a clear penalty.\"\nAsked whether the title race was over, Mourinho replied: \"Probably, yes. Manchester City are a very good team and they are protected by the luck, and the gods of football are behind them.\"\nBefore Sunday's game, Mourinho had suggested City's players go down too easily - something Guardiola dismissed, along with the Portuguese's assertion United should have had a penalty.\n\"Last season it was the same - we won here and it was the referee. Today as well,\" Guardiola said.\n\"Yesterday he spoke about the referee. We are an honest team. We had 65% ball possession, which means we wanted to play. We came here and did that.\n\"It's not true that my players go down easily. That is not an argument I believe.\"\nSunday's result ended United's 40-match unbeaten run at home - which stretched back to City's win here in September 2016.\nCity, who have dropped only two points in their first 16 league games, had opportunities to extend their lead but it was keeper Ederson who made the decisive late intervention with a miraculous double late save from the luckless Lukaku and substitute Juan Mata.\nPodcast: Is the Premier League title race over?\nListen: Man Utd were outfought and outplayed - Savage\nIs the title race over?\nIt is a brave call to declare the title race over in early December - but the statistics and evidence are piling up to suggest the chase is on for second place behind City.\nCity will effectively have to lose four games while all of their rivals need to keep winning, tough to see with Guardiola's team having won every league match since Everton took a point at Etihad Stadium in the second game of the season.\n\"We are still in December. If we have 11 points when we play the second derby in April then maybe I will tell you that we have the title,\" said Guardiola, who was full of praise for his side's performance.\n\"We won at Old Trafford again, that is why I am the most pleased and of course for the three points,\" he added. \"We played good, with a lot of courage. I'm so satisfied.\"\nThe trip to Old Trafford, and the renewal of old rivalries between Guardiola and Mourinho, was the most eagerly awaited game of the season between the two teams at the top of the table and was seen as the acid test of City's apparent infallibility.\nThose looking for cracks in the Guardiola armour pointed to City having to secure three wins against Huddersfield Town, Southampton and West Ham United with late, late goals.\nIf City's confidence had been shaken at all by having to fight for victories, there was no sign here as they played with a composure and positivity that was a level above United.\nThere can be no doubt City were deserved winners and even showed the street wisdom of champions to run down the clock in the closing seconds, to the fury and frustration of Old Trafford.\nThe title race may not be over - but there was no escaping the feeling a crucial blow has been inflicted on United and the rest of City's pursuers.\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\nSilva may be small in stature but he stood head and shoulders above every other player in the intense heat of this game.\nThe Spaniard may now be 31 but it is little wonder City were so delighted to secure him on a new contract until 2020.\nSilva showed again why he deserves to be ranked as a Premier League great, and one of the finest players to play for City.\nHe had more time on the ball than any other player, the hallmark of class, and always seemed to have more options in possession than any other player.\nSilva pounced for City's crucial first goal, held his own in the physical exchanges and even shrugged off a heavy bang to the head in a clash with United's Marcos Rojo.\nIt was a complete performance from a world-class player.\nMourinho too negative?\nCity fans stayed in their seats long after the final whistle, delivering a taunt that had echoed around Old Trafford throughout this landmark victory.\n\"Park The Bus, Park The Bus, Man United\u2026\" was the chant that was met with a muted response from the home support, who had seen City show more attacking intent and flair than Mourinho's side could muster.\nUntil a predictable late charge, this was a strangely muted display from United. Their need for victory was arguably greater than City's as they started the game with an eight-point deficit, but they spent much of the first half on the back foot.\nMourinho's line-up demonstrated attacking intent with the inclusion of Lukaku, Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial. United also missed the power and influence of Paul Pogba, suspended after his red card at Arsenal.\nIt was still a surprise, however, to see City so comprehensively dominant from the opening exchanges and United were barely able to believe their luck that they went in at half-time on level terms.\nLukaku's lack of confidence and touch did not help and there was an element of good fortune about Ederson's late saves - but there was no doubt United did not push hard enough for victory and were second best.\nGuardiola's hold over Mourinho - match stats\nThis was just the second time a team has scored more than one goal in the Premier League at Old Trafford against Mourinho's Manchester United (also City in September 2016, 2-1).\nMourinho has lost nine matches in all competitions against Guardiola, more than against any other manager.\nUnited posted a 35% possession figure, their lowest at Old Trafford in the Premier League since 2003-04 (when Opta started collecting this data).\nRashford has been involved in 11 goals in 12 games in all competitions at Old Trafford this season (six goals, five assists), more than any other United player.\nOtamendi is now the top-scoring defender in the Premier League this season (four goals).\nLukaku has scored just five goals in his past 40 Premier League appearances against the 'big six'.\nWhat's next?\nUnited welcome Bournemouth to Old Trafford on Wednesday at 20:00 GMT and are at West Brom on Sunday, 17 December at 14:15.\nCity travel to Swansea on Wednesday (19:45), before hosting Tottenham on Saturday (17:30)."

It's a tough task for us winning games at this level but, Leicester blew the roof off dreams in football.\"\n5 live In Short: 'We\u2019re delighted he\u2019s stayed' \u2013 Heaton on Dyche\nFootball Daily Podcast: Burnley go fourth\nSince 2003, Leicester are the only English club other than Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham to have played in the Champions League proper, doing so after winning the title in 2015-16.\nBarnes' strike - after the ball ricocheted off team-mate Scott Arfield - was one of few clear-cut chances in the match, though Stoke's Peter Crouch hit the post early on.\nDyche's side climb into the Champions League places above Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham - who all play on Wednesday - while Stoke stay 15th.\n\"We found a way to win and a fine goal,\" said Dyche. \"We're not the real deal, we're a side that are improving.\n\"I keep reality because this division will eat you alive. We're having a real go at what we can achieve this season.\"\nBurnley - good in a tight spot\nBurnley were not at their best for much of the game - perhaps inhibited by the prospect of leapfrogging some of the Premier League's biggest names, even if only for 24 hours.\nSteven Defour was the only Clarets player to have a shot on target prior to Barnes' decisive strike - his second goal of the season. Indeed the most alarming moment for Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland in the first half came when he fumbled the slippery ball from a looping cross, but he quickly recovered.\nIt was a typically determined display by Dyche's side, whose eighth clean sheet of the season is only bettered by Manchester United's nine.\nA sixth 1-0 win of 2017-18 shows how well they can close out tight games, and they are 14 points and 12 places better off than after 17 games last season.\nDizzy heights and European nights?\nBurnley's climb into the top four will have some fans dreaming of the return of European football to Turf Moor.\nThe Clarets' last European venture was in the Fairs Cup in 1966-67, six years after a memorable flirtation with the European Cup.\nWinning the league in 1960 put Harry Potts' side into Europe's elite club competition - and they won both of their home matches.\nBut, after beating Reims on aggregate, defeat by Hamburg in the quarter-finals brought an end to their first European adventure.\nThey looked well placed to return in 1975, but having climbed into the top three on 21 March, a side featuring players such as Leighton James and Brian Flynn eventually finished 10th.\nProblems mount for Hughes\nWhile Dyche's stock is on the rise, defeat will only increase the focus on Stoke counterpart Mark Hughes.\nThe Potters players were confronted by angry fans at the city's railway station after sharing a train following their 5-1 defeat by Tottenham on Saturday.\nHughes hoped that would provoke a response from his players, and he certainly got one in the early stages.\nBut Stoke were ultimately unable to take advantage of an unusually tentative Burnley as they slipped to a fourth defeat in their past five games.\n\"Don't tell me that anyone says Burnley deserved to win that, because they didn't,\" Hughes said. \"The lads are devastated.\n\"We'll be OK, we're fine. We are working hard to try to turn this around but I am encouraged by what I've seen tonight.\"\nThe 16 points Stoke have taken from their opening 17 games is their lowest at this stage of a Premier League season.\nAnd Barnes' goal was the 36th they have conceded in the league this season - the worst record in the top flight.\nMan of the match - Steven Defour\nWhat the managers said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We're having a real go at what we can achieve this season. I'm not being negative. I'm a realist, there's a lot of challenges coming our way. The fans and the town have got to enjoy these times, why wouldn't you?\n\"A lot of psychology goes into some of our planning. I want the players to know that they can grow here, develop as players and get results. We are moving forward each season.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I thought the lads were fantastic and matched everything Burnley threw at us. I thought when we were able to get the ball down, we were the team trying to create openings in wide areas and get good balls in.\nOn the goal: \"Another long ball goes into our box and it drops fortunately for the lad. It's hard to take. I'm pleased with what we produced.\"\nIt's the late, late show - the stats\nBurnley have taken six points from goals in the last 10 minutes of their top-flight games this season; only Manchester City have managed more (9).\nPremier League games at Turf Moor this season have produced just 10 goals (in nine games), five fewer than any other ground.\nArfield has registered two goal involvements in his past two Premier League games, as many as in his previous 55 in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to the south coast to face Brighton on Saturday at 15:00 GMT, while Stoke host West Ham at the same time."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 1-3 Chelsea\nManager Antonio Conte defended his remarks that Chelsea are out of the title race after his side bounced back from defeat against struggling West Ham to comfortably win away to Huddersfield Town.\nThe Blues were criticised after losing to the Hammers on Saturday, a result which led Conte to concede the 2016-17 champions could not win the Premier League.\nHowever, they moved level on points with second-placed Manchester United after goals by Tiemoue Bakayoko, Willian and Pedro ensured Huddersfield lost for the fifth time in six games.\nChelsea are still 11 points behind leaders Manchester City, a gap the Italian still believes is too large to bridge.\n\"You must be realistic. I prefer to tell the truth rather than a good lie,\" said Conte after Tuesday's game.\n\"Sometimes I can be too honest but I like to speak honestly with my players and our fans. It doesn't mean we don't want to try to catch them.\n\"Our path is a great path but for sure there is a team that is in this way. It is very hard, now, to stop them.\"\nFrance midfielder Bakayoko, substituted at half-time in the surprise defeat to West Ham on Saturday, set Conte's side on their way by clipping the ball beyond Jonas Lossl after the Huddersfield keeper had slipped in the wet conditions making a clearance.\nBrazil midfielder Willian doubled the lead before the interval with a header before teeing-up Pedro to hammer the third goal.\nSubstitute Laurent Depoitre headed a late consolation but Huddersfield were well beaten.\n\"It could have been a really horrible night after the third, but our players reacted and got the goal at the end,\" said Terriers boss David Wagner.\nRelive the action from the John Smith's Stadium\nNo fatigue as Blues bounce back\nIn the past two weeks Conte has claimed there was a fixture conspiracy against his team while, on the eve of Chelsea's 25th league and cup game, the Italian complained of fatigue being his team's biggest enemy.\nYet if the Blues are feeling tired juggling domestic and European commitments, they did not show it in west Yorkshire.\nChelsea dominated from start to finish and scored all three goals in the first 50 minutes.\nThe visitors arrived in Huddersfield having endured a difficult week - defeat at West Ham coming after failure to finish top of their Champions League group left them a tough last-16 tie with Barcelona to negotiate.\nThe return of Willian, one of four changes made by Conte, was key, with the former Shakhtar Donetsk player involved in all three goals.\nHis clever pass enabled Bakayoko to score his third goal in a blue shirt since his move from Monaco in a \u00a340m deal - the attack started by Lossl's slip.\nBakayoko should have made it 2-0 but headed wide after Willian had whipped in a free-kick before the latter made it 2-0, a close range header from Marcos Alonso's cross.\nHuddersfield's lacklustre performance enabled Chelsea to extend their lead further, Pedro finding the top corner after Willian chested another Alonso cross into his path.\nIt was all too easy for the visitors, who sent on Michy Batshuayi for the final 21 minutes six days after the \u00a333m signing had helped the club's under-21s beat MK Dons 4-0 in the Checkatrade Trophy.\nBelgium forward Batshuayi again failed to make Conte's starting line-up even though Alvaro Morata was missing with a back problem.\nChelsea also sent on 17-year-old substitute Ethan Ampadu with 10 minutes remaining - the second youngest player to make an appearance in the Premier League for the club behind Jody Morris in 1996.\nTerriers lack bite\nFixtures against the likes of Chelsea are unlikely to determine Huddersfield's Premier League fate, yet they were a shadow of the side that famously beat Manchester United two months ago.\nThey allowed Chelsea to bully them from the start and it was only in the closing stages, when some fans had left the stadium and Chelsea had the points in the bag, that they improved.\nTheir first touch won in Chelsea's penalty area came after an hour, while they managed just two shots on target all game.\nLossl's slip that led to the first goal was unfortunate but the defending for Willian's goal was poor, and Pedro was unmarked when he fired home.\nHuddersfield's cause was not helped when midfielder Jonathan Hogg was substituted at half-time after suffering a migraine and was struggling to see the ball.\nWagner's side have now played all the 'big six' but they will have to keep possession better than they did against Chelsea when they entertain the likes of Stoke, Burnley and West Ham in the coming weeks.\nDepoitre's late consolation was an excellent glancing header from fellow substitute Florent Hadergjonaj's cross. It was a pity many Huddersfield fans were already on their way home and missed it.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nKeeping their heads - the stats\nChelsea have scored 10 headed goals in the Premier League this season - they only scored eight in the whole of last season.\nMarcos Alonso has had a hand in 13 goals since his Chelsea debut (9 goals, 4 assists) - two more than any other Premier League defender.\nChelsea's win at Huddersfield means the Blues have won at 50 different stadiums in the Premier League. Only Liverpool have won at more stadiums in the competition (53).\nWillian has been directly involved in six goals in his last four starts in all competitions for Chelsea.\nAt 17 years and 89 days old, Ethan Ampadu is the second youngest Chelsea player to make an appearance in the Premier League after Jody Morris (17 years 43 days).\nWhat's next?\nWagner will hope to see an improvement from his side when they face Watford away on Saturday in the Premier League (15:00 GMT), while Chelsea at are home to Southampton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-1 Watford\nManager Roy Hodgson said Crystal Palace's problems are far from over despite two late goals in a dramatic win over Watford moving them out of the Premier League relegation zone for the first time this season.\nThe game turned when Watford's Tom Cleverley was sent off for a second yellow card in the 87th minute, setting up a breathtaking finale.\nBakary Sako bundled in an equaliser two minutes later before James McArthur snatched the winner in the second minute of stoppage time, side-footing home from Wilfried Zaha's cross.\nThe Hornets had looked comfortable until that point after Daryl Janmaat had given visitors the lead after just three minutes.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe victory for Hodgson's Palace extends their unbeaten run to six games and sees them climb above West Brom into 17th place in the table.\n\"The moment we think our problems are over is the moment our problems will begin,\" Hodgson said.\n\"We have a mountain to climb and it's wonderful to win but we're still very close to the bottom of the table because we haven't quite made up from getting zero points from the first seven games.\"\nPalace could return to the bottom three on Wednesday with the teams below them - West Brom, West Ham and Swansea - all in action.\nReaction to all of Tuesday night's Premier League games\nA late, late show for Palace\nHaving spent the entire season in the bottom three, and scoring no goals and collecting no points in their opening seven fixtures, the night looked like being yet another frustrating one for Palace where an opportunity would be missed.\nThey had lacked real threat in the final third and did not have a shot on target until an effort from Zaha inside the final five minutes.\nBut when Cleverley was dismissed for a late foul on Jeff Schlupp, life was breathed into the game and the home fans roared their side on in anticipation.\nThe equaliser was fortunate. Sako's initial shot from close range rebounded off Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, back on to the forward's shins and into the net but the winner came at the end of an excellent move.\nZaha - a threat but occasionally wasteful throughout - showed great trickery to beat Janmaat on the left side of the box before squaring to McArthur who swept home low beyond Gomes.\nThe result unsurprisingly led to wild celebrations at the final whistle as the players and fans enjoyed a third win of the season.\n\"It is a huge three points. Where we are in the table every three points is unbelievably worked for,\" Hodgson said.\nAll three of Palace's wins have come under Hodgson, who replaced Frank de Boer after four games, and the former England boss now has 14 points from 13 matches.\nThe Eagles were six points from safety following defeat to Tottenham on 5 November but have now dealt a psychological blow to their rivals at the bottom of the table.\n\"It is stressful but if I didn't think I was able to take that stress then I wouldn't have taken up the offer to come and work at this club,\" Hodgson added.\nWatford rue Cleverley red\nWatford manager Marco Silva said he found the result \"hard to believe\" at full-time, pointing to frustration that his side had not killed the game off when they were clearly on top.\n\"If you want to fight in football and take the points you deserve you have to play for 95 minutes,\" Silva said. \"We did everything well until 90 minutes.\n\"We were leading but 1-0 is not enough.\"\nThe red card was the moment the match turned and the Portuguese did not argue with the decision to send off Cleverley, who lunged in on Schlupp when already on a yellow card.\nInstead, Silva claimed Palace's Patrick van Aanholt should have been dismissed for his tackle from behind on Roberto Pereyra two minutes earlier, for which he was shown yellow.\nThe visitors started the game strongly and capitalised on poor defending for their early goal as Janmaat headed in Richarlison's excellent cross unchallenged at the back post.\nHornets skipper Troy Deeney missed a glorious chance in the 30th minute when he poked wide from six yards, although Palace defender Scott Dann did get a slight touch on the cross from Richarlison.\nRicharlison himself later failed to convert an excellent second-half opportunity when his shot from inside the area was blocked by the legs of Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni.\nIn the end, however, Watford were again left rueing the cost of indiscipline.\nThe Hornets have now received eight red cards since the start of the 2016-17 season, more than any other club, and it is a \"real problem\" according to their manager.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\nThe best stats\nPalace have picked up 10 points from their last six Premier League games, as many as they managed from their previous 17 in the competition.\nThe Eagles find themselves out of the relegation zone for the first time since the very first day of the 2017/18 Premier League season (11/08/2017).\nJulian Speroni made his 400th appearance for Crystal Palace in all competitions, 4,868 days since his debut for the Eagles (14/08/2004).\nRicharlison has had a hand in eight away Premier League goals (4 goals, 4 assists), a joint-high this season with Mohamed Salah (7 goals, 1 assist).\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to in-form Leicester on Saturday (12:30 GMT). Watford return to Vicarage Road on Saturday following back-to-back away games and host Huddersfield (15:00)."

The Iceland international had struggled for form in the first part of the season but has become increasingly influential since Allardyce's arrival, while Rooney has scored five.\nNewcastle must dread facing the former Manchester United striker. He has now been involved in 23 goals in his 23 Premier League appearances against them (15 goals, 8 assists) - more than versus any other opponent.\nAt the back Ashley Williams, struggling badly for form until Allardyce's appointment, was in dominant mood, while defensive midfielder Gueye was full of endeavour.\nAllardyce said he will \"pay his players back\" for postponing their festive celebrations if their Premier League upturn is intact by January.\nAt this rate, he'd better have deep pockets.\nBenitez needs clarity on January\nNewcastle can offer up some hard-luck stories from a night that saw them strike the woodwork twice, have more possession, crosses and shots than the visitors.\nBut hard-luck tales don't equal points, and Benitez needs the January transfer window more than ever to add goals and steel to his squad.\nHe also needs certainty on the club's future ownership. The Spaniard, not to mention the Magpies' fans, will be praying Staveley's takeover is completed while they still have a chance to do something about their growing relegation fears.\nBenitez says he still doesn't know his budget for next month. He needs clarity fast.\nMan of the match - Idrissa Gueye (Everton)\nEverton's first win on the road in 17 attempts - stats\nNewcastle have picked up just one point in their last eight Premier League games (W0 D1 L7).\nEverton have collected 10 points in their last four Premier League games - one more than they managed in their previous 12 (9).\nEverton ended a run of 16 Premier League away games without a win (D8 L8), claiming their first victory since winning 1-0 at Sam Allardyce's Crystal Palace in January.\nNewcastle United have lost four consecutive home league games at St James' Park for the first time since April 2015 under John Carver.\nNewcastle haven't won any of their last 44 home Premier League games in which they've gone in behind at half-time since winning 3-2 against Reading in December 2006.\nOnly one Newcastle player has received more red cards in a single Premier League season than Jonjo Shelvey this season (2) - David Batty in 1997/98 (3)\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle face Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Everton host Swansea City at Goodison Park on Monday (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-4 Leicester City\nLeicester defender Harry Maguire says \"confidence is flowing\" as manager Claude Puel experienced a comfortable victory on his return to former club Southampton.\nPuel was sacked by the Saints in June after just one season in charge, having guided the club to eighth place and the League Cup final.\nThe Frenchman, who took over at Leicester in October, celebrated on the touchline without going over the top as the Foxes claimed their fourth consecutive win in style thanks to two goals from Shinji Okazaki.\n\"When Claude came in we were struggling to score goals but now we are finding the net,\" Maguire said. \"We create chances and score goals.\"\nLeicester took an early lead at St Mary's with a fine individual goal from Algeria winger Riyad Mahrez, who cut in from the left before striking a low, powerful shot into the corner of the net.\nJapan international Okazaki added a second just after the half-hour mark, pouncing from close range after Southampton failed to clear a shot from Christian Fuchs following a corner.\nPuel's side were three goals ahead by half-time when Maguire crossed for midfielder Andy King to tap in at the back post.\nSouthampton, much improved after the break, pulled a goal back after an hour through defender Maya Yoshida, who climbed highest in the six-yard box to head in Ryan Bertrand's corner kick.\nBut the visitors blunted any hopes of a Saints comeback when Jamie Vardy's cross picked out strike partner Okazaki's brilliant run and he finished emphatically.\nPuel savours return to St Mary's\nPuel's single season at Southampton, on the face of it, looked impressive, finishing eighth in the Premier League and taking his side to the League Cup final at Wembley, which they were unfortunate to lose to Manchester United.\nAnd yet nobody was shocked when the 56-year-old was sacked at the conclusion of a campaign in which he failed to capture the imagination of the home support and suffered from accusations that the football his Southampton side produced was dull.\nThe statistics were hardly compelling, with Puel's Southampton scoring only three goals in his last seven Premier League matches at St Mary's - so what a contrast on his return as Leicester matched that tally inside 38 minutes.\nPuel's Leicester are vibrant, lethal on the break and were committed to attack from the kick-off - a hallmark of his short time in charge.\nAnd how Leicester's fans loved it, chanting \"Are you glad you sacked Puel?\" at their frustrated Southampton counterparts as his successor Mauricio Pellegrino felt the fury of the home fans.\nPuel celebrated Leicester's goals with real delight without being excessive - but he must have been left with a real sense of pleasure after another satisfying night.\nMahrez back to his best\nIn the early stages of the season, Mahrez was a shadow of the brilliant attacker who helped to inspire their title victory in 2015-16 and won the recognition of his peers when he was named PFA Player Of The Year.\nMahrez was at the centre of transfer speculation right up until the window closed at the end of August - but the arrival of Puel has coincided with a return of the Algerian's finest form.\nHe has struck spectacularly at home to Tottenham and away at Newcastle recently and was on target to break the early deadlock in Southampton with a trademark low left-foot finish after a run that created his own space.\nMahrez also helped set up Okazaki for Leicester's fourth and produced a performance to warm Leicester's travelling support on a bitterly cold and wet night.\nThe transfer speculation may spark up again when the window opens in January - but for now Leicester and Puel will simply be delighted to have a mercurial talent back on peak form.\nMiserable night for Pellegrino\nSouthampton's night went rapidly downhill after the first couple of minutes in which they managed to cause Leicester's defence minor anxiety.\nOnce Leicester settled down and got the measure of Southampton, their pace, width and speed on the counter-attack reduced the home defence to a disorganised shambles, including centre-back Virgil van Dijk.\nAs Southampton's performance deteriorated, so the discontent of the home fans became more obvious, especially with a deafening chorus of jeers at half-time.\nYoshida's goal offered the briefest of hope for Southampton and they almost grabbed a second when Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel blocked Charlie Austin's shot miraculously at the far post.\nIn reality, they were outclassed from start to finish and Leicester only emphasised the gulf between the sides by increasing the tempo to quickly restore their three-goal advantage through Okazaki.\nPellegrino stood disconsolately in his technical area as he looked out at a near-deserted St Mary's at the final whistle with only four league wins this season.\nThis was a night that belonged to a Saints manager past, rather than a Saints manager present.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez\n'An awful day, that's the reality' - what they said\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"The result is the result. It is a good feeling to come back here. It was nice to see familiar faces. I have a lot of friends. I appreciated the staff and players.\n\"My team is the most important thing. I am proud of my players because we gave a fantastic game. It was important to maintain the performance and it was a good result at half-time but we came back again.\n\"If we have the ability to maintain the good results with changes it will be good for the future. It is still the first part of the season and the Premier League is difficult every week. All is not perfect, we still need to correct things and make progress.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was a really bad game from the beginning to the end. After conceding the first goal they were getting better and little by little our confidence went down. We gave the ball away all the time.\n\"For me it is a bit about concentration, not being 100% focused and at this level you cannot be giving this advantage. It was an awful day and that is the reality.\n\"In the Premier League there are a group of teams where the gap is four or five points and we have to fight. Obviously we have the same feelings as the supporters. Three days before we played a good game but in football in three days everything changes. We need to react now.\"\nMahrez boxes it off for Leicester - the stats\nSince Claude Puel took charge of Leicester only Manchester City (21) and Burnley (18) have won more points in the Premier League than the Foxes (17).\nLeicester City scored four goals in an away Premier League game for the first time since drawing 4-4 with Spurs in February 2004.\nSouthampton conceded three first-half goals in a home Premier League game for the first time since April 2005 against Norwich City.\nFive of Riyad Mahrez's last eight Premier League goals have been from outside the box - his previous 21 were all scored from inside the box.\nShinji Okazaki scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time.\nThis match was the first in Premier League history to see two different Asian goalscorers - Okazaki for Leicester and Maya Yoshida for Southampton.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Crystal Palace in Saturday's early kick-off (12:30 GMT) while later that afternoon at 15:00 GMT Southampton face Premier League champions Chelsea at Stamford Bridge."

That's why I'm delighted for David that he is scoring goals.\"\n'Magician' Silva impresses\nMatch of the Day pundit and former England striker Alan Shearer added: \"We are watching a magician in David Silva. His performances just get better.\n\"He gets everything ticking over at pace, left foot, right foot - you name it. He was creating chances for them all.\n\"It's so quick, there is not anything he cannot do, and his attitude is fantastic. It's absolutely magnificent, and how he looks after himself.\"\nManchester City march on\nManchester City stretched their lead in the Premier League to a commanding 11 points with a 14th successive league win - a new record for the English top flight - in Sunday's derby against Manchester United.\nTheir rowdy celebrations at Old Trafford irked United manager Jose Mourinho, who said they had shown a lack of respect by playing music loudly in their changing room.\nBut, in the hours leading up to their match against Swansea, it was notable in the bowels of the Liberty Stadium that music was once again blaring out as they prepared.\nThe visitors were immediately into their groove, with the recalled Aguero firing wide and Fernandinho's crisp low volley well saved by Fabianski.\nBut the Poland goalkeeper was stranded when an inswinging cross from Bernardo Silva found his namesake David unmarked and unhurried as he nonchalantly back-heeled the ball into the net.\nGuardiola's men had barely broken sweat by the time they doubled their lead, De Bruyne's whipped free-kick sneaking through a crowd of bodies and beyond an unsighted Fabianski.\nGiven their 2-0 half-time advantage, they may have been tempted to ease off after the restart but, if anything, they increased the intensity as they continued to drive towards Swansea's penalty area.\nTheir dominance owed much to the magic of captain Silva, who played a deft one-two with Raheem Sterling before artfully lifting the ball over Fabianski for the third goal.\nAguero joined in the fun late on, collecting a pass from Yaya Toure before driving into the Swans' box and finishing decisively into the bottom corner.\nSwansea stay bottom\nThe mood in the Swansea side going into this game will have been happier than it was a week earlier, with Saturday's win over West Brom - their first since October - easing the pressure on head coach Paul Clement.\nThe three points also lifted the Welsh side off the foot of the Premier League table, only for Crystal Palace's dramatic late victory against Watford on Tuesday to move Clement's men back to the bottom.\nAlthough their home record of five defeats, two wins and a draw offered little hope, Swansea had at least demonstrated at times this season - such as the goalless draw at Tottenham - that they had the capacity to frustrate illustrious opponents.\nHowever, any thoughts of an upset on this occasion were swiftly put to rest.\nSwansea could not lay a glove on City and, although better teams have also been undone by Guardiola's often irresistible charges, Clement was disappointed with his side's meek display.\nThey lacked tenacity defensively and could not keep possession for any meaningful length of time, which meant they were constantly under pressure from their frighteningly skilful opponents.\nSwansea's survival will not depend on fixtures against teams as powerful as City but, if they are to avoid relegation again this season, they will need to play with more fire and belief than they did on this occasion.\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\nIt was a masterful display from David Silva as he orchestrated matters in midfield and scored two delightful goals.\nSwansea's home woe continues - the stats\nManchester City have won 13 and lost only one of their last 16 matches between the clubs in all competitions.\nSwansea have only gained seven points at home, the worst record of any team in the Premier League.\nCity have set an English top-flight record of 15 successive league wins within a single season. They had previously held the record along with Arsenal's 14-match winning run between February and August 2002.\nManchester City have won all nine away league matches in 2017-18.\nKevin de Bruyne has now been involved in 13 goals (five goals, eight assists) in his 14 Premier League appearances since the start of September.\nDavid Silva has been involved in 13 Premier League goals in 17 games this season (five goals, eight assists) - already more than in the whole of 2016-17 (11 goal involvements in 34 games).\n'Manchester City won't get complacent' - what they said\nSwansea City manager Paul Clement said: \"At times it was horrible to be on the sideline watching that, seeing my side trying but suffering for long periods.\n\"They're not the games that will decide our season but it was hard to watch at times because they were so dominant. For me, they (Manchester City) are one of the best sides I've ever come across - so many good athletes, so many intelligent footballers and it's really hard to pin them down.\n\"We actually had some attempts on their goal so I'm disappointed we didn't get on the scoresheet but they were a far superior side to us. We've got to put it to one side. We have got Everton away (next) and we've got to try and pick something up there.\"\nAsked if Swansea will spend money in the January transfer window, Clement answered: \"If we're going to sustain Premier League status, that's a must.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola said: \"Considering we have had a lot of games in our legs, a demanding game at Old Trafford three days ago, we were solid, we were serious and we made a good performance.\n\"When the team play good we are happy and we understand what we want to do. We play good inside, outside. I'm so happy for David (Silva), we cannot disguise his quality but in the past he didn't score too many goals, but he's sharp and in an amazing condition.\"\nAsked if complacency could affect his team, Guardiola replied: \"That is not going to happen. We are so demanding for our players.\n\"We can lose, we can drop points but complacency, it has never happened in the past, the present or the future. Winning 15 games in a row gives us a lot of confidence. If people are happy watching us, that is the best gift.\"\nWhat's next?\nSwansea's next game is on Monday, 18 December (20:00 GMT) with an away match against Everton.\nThis was the first of three matches for Manchester City in a week. They play at home against Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday, 16 December (17:30 GMT) and then face an away tie at Leicester City in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, 19 December (19:45 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-0 Bournemouth\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho said he would be \"on holiday in Brazil or Los Angeles\" if he thought the Premier League title race was over, as his side edged past Bournemouth.\nUnited bounced back from their defeat by rivals Manchester City with a victory, but failed to make any inroads on unbeaten league leaders City, who thrashed Swansea 4-0 to maintain their 11-point advantage.\nBelgium striker Romelu Lukaku scored the winner in the first half, heading in to the top corner from Juan Mata's cross towards the six-yard box.\nMourinho said: \"The City game was a big one, and a defeat does not help in your recovery - victories help, defeats don't.\n\"Bournemouth were difficult opponents and difficult conditions. If we had scored the second it would have been a calm night for us.\n\"I am pleased with the three points. They had one more day's rest than us, they were fresher than us, and mentally fresher because a big match takes more from our players.\n\"[The title race] is only over in May. If it is over now I go on holiday to Brazil or Los Angeles.\"\nUnited could have netted a second but substitute Marcus Rashford's thumping drive came back off the crossbar.\nVisitors Bournemouth caused plenty of problems for United but were unable to find a way past David de Gea, whose best save of the contest came from Ryan Fraser's cross-shot.\nRelive Manchester United's victory over Bournemouth\nSluggish showing from United\nUnited's 40-game unbeaten run at Old Trafford was brought to an end by Pep Guardiola's side on Sunday and they were extremely fortunate to claim three points against the Cherries.\nThe hosts were second best for much of the contest and had just two shots on target, as Mourinho maintained his record of not losing consecutive games at home as a manager.\nFrontman Lukaku bore the brunt of the criticism for the 2-1 defeat by City, but he claimed the only goal in this match - and his 14th of the season - by rising above former Chelsea team-mate Nathan Ake and planting a header past goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.\nHowever, Bournemouth were left questioning whether the goal should have stood as Anthony Martial collided with Adam Smith in the lead-up.\nLukaku could have added to his tally but had an effort pushed away by Begovic and Martial lashed over the follow-up from six yards out.\nDespite the sluggish showing, the performances of defender Luke Shaw and midfielder Scott McTominay will be pleasing to Mourinho and the supporters.\nShaw, given his first league start in seven months, looked fit and sharp, contributing three tackles and gaining the ball back six times in the match. McTominay was neat in possession and had a 91.7% accuracy from his 47 passes.\nMourinho added: \"I am not saying he is first or second choice, Shaw is an option. His history is an incredible injury and more surgery at the end of last season.\n\"He needs competitive matches, we gave him that and he had some cramps so we had to change him. The standing ovation for him I liked, it helps the player.\"\nMissed chances prove costly\nBournemouth continued their inconsistent season and have now failed to win their last five games in the top flight. The result leaves the south coast side just two points above the relegation zone.\nIt does not get any easier for Eddie Howe's side, coming up against Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United in their next league and EFL Cup games.\nThere were no points to show for it but they will buoyed by their performance in wet and windy conditions in the north west, keeping home goalkeeper De Gea busy throughout and calling the Spaniard into making seven saves in the match.\nFull-back Charlie Daniels could have netted in the opening period but his low drive from a weaving run was tipped to safety by De Gea, who also kept out Junior Stanislas' deflected drive.\nJermain Defoe was sent on to try to find the breakthrough, but the striker was twice thwarted by De Gea, spinning and fizzing a shot straight at the United number one on both occasions.\nHowe said: \"I am very disappointed, I thought we were excellent. We created opportunities, our defensive shape was very good and we deserved a lot more today.\n\"We worked De Gea a lot in the first half but I am disappointed with the goal we conceded. We kept going, ended the game strongly but it was not to be.\n\"This was a big test mentally, we came with a game plan and they delivered that. The frustration is they don't get the reward of a win.\"\nAnalysis - Trouble behind the scenes for United?\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer on Match of the Day:\n\"Unless there is something we are unaware of, it was a very surprising lack of reaction from Lukaku to his goal. Maybe that was in answer to the criticism he has been receiving. It was only his second Premier League goal in 10 games.\n\"I said something negative about him at the weekend, that he has to show more, but when you score that is the perfect answer.\n\"That is why I was surprised he did not run away, smile or put his arm in the air. It is such a fantastic feeling when you score goals, particularly the winning ones.\"\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day:\n\"I was really impressed with Bournemouth, we see teams sitting back and giving others too much respect but they did not do that. Callum Wilson and Joshua King caused United plenty of problems.\n\"It is nice to see a team throwing men forward and committing. If you are going to lose a game, at least do it by having a go. De Gea has been superb recently and made a couple of decent stops.\"\nMan of the match - David de Gea (Manchester United)\nWhat next?\nUnited travel to West Brom on Sunday (kick-off 14:15 GMT), while Bournemouth travel to Liverpool on the same day (16:30 GMT).\nFlat track bully Lukaku? The stats\nManchester United have won nine of their last 10 Premier League games at Old Trafford (lost one), keeping a clean sheet in eight of these victories.\nSince earning promotion in 2015, Bournemouth have taken just 13 points from a possible 87 against the 'top six' teams in the Premier League (29 games).\nThis was Jose Mourinho's first home win against Bournemouth in the Premier League, in what was his third attempt - the only sides he has faced at home in the competition without winning are Burnley (twice) and Reading (once).\nSince the start of 2016-17, Romelu Lukaku has scored 30 goals in 38 Premier League appearances against sides outside of the 'big six' teams.\nThe Belgian has scored six goals in five appearances against Bournemouth in the Premier League, with five of those coming in home games.\nJuan Mata (18) has made more assists than any other Manchester United player in the Premier League since his debut in January 2014.\nBournemouth had five more shots on target than the home side in this game - the last opposition side to have more in a Premier League game at Old Trafford was Liverpool in March 2014 (six more than Manchester United).\nLuke Shaw made his first appearance in the Premier League this season, although he has not completed 90 minutes in the competition since October 2016 (0-0 v Burnley)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-0 West Bromwich Albion\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said his side could not complain after failing to unpick a stubborn West Brom's defence in a frustrating stalemate at Anfield.\n\"That was not our best game tonight but I think we had enough chances to win,\" said the German.\n\"We didn't use them and we have to accept the result.\"\nRoberto Firmino screwed a side-foot finish narrowly wide before Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross eluded Mohamed Salah in the first half.\nThe Baggies came just as close before the interval, however, with Hal Robson-Kanu's measured curling shot from distance flicking the bar.\nLiverpool pressed further forward in the second with Salah mis-timing a header with the net gaping.\nSubstitute Dominic Solanke, who added another attacking focal point off the bench for the hosts, had a goal disallowed for handball and a shot cleared off the line in the final 10 minutes as West Brom's defence remained unbreached.\nReaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nIt was a worryingly familiar feeling at the full-time whistle for the Reds after Everton's rearguard action earned a point on Sunday, and Manchester United and Burnley deployed similar tactics with similar success earlier this season.\nThe Reds are behind Tottenham and outside the top four on goal difference. At the opposite end of the table, a hard-earned point takes Alan Pardew's side out of the bottom three.\n'Fab Four' reunion falls flat\nJurgen Klopp refused to entertain what-might-have-beens in the wake of the derby but his team selection was telling.\nBy picking Salah, Firmino, Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho from the start he trained Liverpool's four biggest attacking threats - a prospect the Toffees had been spared - on the West Brom defence.\nThe full weight of the hosts' attacking quality stressed and strained the West Brom rearguard but ultimately could not force a breakthrough.\nFrustratingly for a team that had 71% of possession, the Reds often posed most threat when West Brom were on the ball in the first half.\nOne jet-heeled counter attack, sprung from a West Brom corner, floundered on Mane's heavy touch as the Baggies found themselves out of position, while another culminated in Alexander-Arnold's cross just away from Salah's stretching boot.\nSolanke and Oxlade-Chamberlain added energy and guile off the bench late on, but the relief around Anfield when the former bundled into the net in the 82nd minute proved short-lived as referee Paul Tierney rightly blew up for an accidental handball.\nPardew starts to turn the tanker\nWest Brom have conceded only two more goals than Liverpool in the Premier League, but scored 22 less than the hosts.\nPardew, only three matches into his reign at the Hawthorns, has promised more ambition in attack to right that lop-sided statistic.\nBut this match, following defeat by bottom side Swansea at the weekend, was not the one to start implementing that longer-term vision.\nInstead, despite James McClean and Robson-Kanu's initial eagerness to support to lone frontman Salomon Rondon, it owed more to the qualities instilled by Pardew's predecessor Tony Pulis.\nFor the most part, McClean and Robson-Kanu tucked back to shore up a bank of five men in front of the defence.\nThat flexible formation gummed up Liverpool's fluid attack, without entirely blunting West Brom's threat going forward.\nA string of swirling Grzegorz Krychowiak deliveries into the Liverpool box after the break caused Loris Karius, in the Liverpool goal for Simon Mignolet, some real discomfort.\nWith the late pressure piling on and a visit from Manchester United to come however, the visitors gladly took the point.\nMan of the match - Trent Alexander-Arnold\nWest Brom's winless run reached record levels - match stats\nThis was just the fifth time Liverpool have failed to score in a Premier League home game under Jurgen Klopp - they had scored at least once in 38 of their previous 42.\nThe Reds are unbeaten in their last eight games in the Premier League (winning five and drawing thee); their longest run without defeat in the competition since November 2016 (11 games).\nHowever, Klopp's side have drawn five of their last seven games at Anfield in the Premier League (winning two), including each of the last three.\nWest Brom have not won any of their last 16 games in all competitions (drawing eight and losing eight); the longest winless run in the club's history.\nSimilarly, the Baggies are winless in 15 games in the Premier League - their only longer such run in the competition came between February 2006 and August 2008 (16 games).\nFourteen points is West Brom's worst haul after 17 games of a Premier League season since 2008-09 (12 points), when they were relegated after a 20th-place finish.\n'You need a bit of luck' - match quotes\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp on Solanke's disallowed goal: It is for sure chest and then I am not sure if handball. We cannot take the decision back so all good, it is like this.\n\"First half we were a little bit stiff, the passing and movement was not so good but even then we had two or three chances. The second half we changed the system two or three times.\n\"We can do better and we have to do better but on a night like this when you are not at your best you need a bit of luck.\"\nWest Brom boss Alan Pardew: \"We were so disappointed to lose at Swansea, we didn't think we deserved to, but you have to earn your right and we were excellent in all aspects of our defending today.\n\"We are growing with defensive confidence. It is looking a little bit brighter tonight.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Bournemouth on Sunday with West Brom at home to Manchester United on the same afternoon."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion\nTottenham moved back into the Premier League top four as goals from Serge Aurier and the in-form Son Heung-min helped them to victory over a stubborn Brighton at Wembley.\nSpurs dominated both territory and possession from the start but had been frustrated by the visitors until Aurier's cross from the right touchline fortuitously looped over Mat Ryan and into the far top corner of the net to give the Ivory Coast full-back his first goal for the club.\nIt was a harsh way to concede for Albion, who had put in a well-organised defensive display in pursuit of a first win in six matches and a first away goal against a side above them in the table.\nThey failed to find either during the second half and their challenge was ended when Son scored for the fourth game running via a stooping header from Christian Eriksen's free-kick.\nErik Lamela - making his first start in over a year following serious hip injury - struck the post with a shot, as did Harry Kane from a free-kick as Spurs claimed a second successive win to move above Liverpool, Burnley and Arsenal.\nBrighton remain 13th in the table, but the gap between them and the bottom three has been cut to three points.\nAnalysis and reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nTottenham back on track\nTottenham dropped eight points in their four Premier League games in November - a run of form that dumped them out of the qualification places for the Champions League just as their results in Europe's premier club competition were hitting new heights.\nThey began the month with an impressive victory over reigning European champions Real Madrid and won at Borussia Dortmund between their league defeat at Arsenal and home draw with West Brom.\nManager Mauricio Pochettino suggested a \"lack of focus\", brought about by their achievements in Europe, had distracted them from their domestic responsibilities, but two wins in five days suggests they are back on target.\nPochettino made four changes to his side - including dropping Dele Alli to the bench - and they had to show greater patience in this encounter than on Saturday when Stoke capitulated to a 5-1 defeat at Wembley.\nAfter an uninspiring first 40 minutes of few chances, and with the home side's patience threatening to turn to frustration, they were given a slice of luck through Aurier's opener.\nHowever, unlike at the weekend, the floodgates failed to open after the break and Spurs were forced to battle for their three points - a task to which they were equal.\nThey did not panic when chances came and went and were rewarded when Son claimed his eighth goal of the season to give his side a comfortable final four minutes.\nShot-shy Brighton fail to make an impact\nThese are worrying times for Brighton.\nLike both Newcastle and Huddersfield - the two other teams promoted from the Championship last season - the Seagulls are finding wins very hard to come by as we move towards winter.\nAlbion are now without a win in five games, having lost the last three.\nChris Hughton's side are well-organised, hard-working and determined - qualities that were again on show at Wembley - but they lack goals and the spark to create them, even with direct attacking players like Anthony Knockaert and Jose Izquierdo, both of whom were recalled to the starting XI.\nThey have attempted 142 shots so far this season - the fewest of any team in the top flight - and have converted just 14 of them in 17 games.\nTheir one and only clear opportunity to score on Wednesday fell to Tomer Hemed - in for Glenn Murray up front - but he fired his snap-shot from inside the box straight at Hugo Lloris.\nAlbion have now failed to score a goal in the six away games they have played against sides currently above them in the league, a group that threatens to grow in number week by week.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\n'Sometimes you need luck' - what they said...\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think it's fantastic for us, three victories in a row (in all competitions) - so important for us. I'm happy with the performance.\nOn Aurier's goal: \"I think he tried to put the ball in there and I think it's fantastic, sometimes you need some luck to score.\n\"The team deserved it, we dominated the game. We deserved to go to half time winning the game, (the win was important to) believe and fight for the Premier League. We created a lot of chances, it's not easy to play when the opponent play in that formation to try only to stop you to play.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"We were always going to be up against it here, with the quality they've got. We went behind to a very fortuitous goal and then we had really good periods in the second half.\n\"When you're a side like us the chances are going to be minimal, you've got to defend well and I thought for large parts of the game we did that. We've gone down to a poor goal from our point of view. What the lad will say, whether he meant it or not? From our side it looks like a cross that's gone in at the far post.\"\nSpurs warming to Wembley - the stats you need to know\nAfter failing to win any of their first three Premier League home games this season, Spurs have won five of their last six at Wembley (D1).\nSerge Aurier became the first Ivorian to score a Premier League goal for Spurs - they've now had players from nine different African nations score for them, the joint-most in the competition (level with Sunderland).\nIndeed, Spurs have now had players of 41 different nationalities score in the Premier League for them - a joint-high with Manchester City.\nChristian Eriksen provided his 42nd Premier League assist - second only to Mesut Ozil (47) since his debut in the competition (in September 2013).\nBrighton are only the second of the 27 different teams that Harry Kane has faced without scoring in the Premier League (also Cardiff).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton host Burnley in the Premier League at 15:00 GMT this Saturday. Tottenham are in action in the evening when they travel to unbeaten league-leaders Manchester City for a 17:30 kick-off."

We're trying to improve that and we want to make our football better.\n\"There's a lot to improve but the first thing was to stop conceding goals. I'm really enjoying it here.\"\nRelive the action from London Stadium\nWhat happened in the Premier League?\nArsenal's Nigeria forward Alex Iwobi struck the outside of Adrian's post as Wenger's side failed to score in the Premier League for the first time in three months.\nWest Ham also hit the woodwork in the closing stages through substitute Javier Hernandez after the Gunners failed to clear.\nArsenal could have climbed to fourth with a win, but the draw leaves them a point behind Tottenham, who are in the final Champions League place.\n\"There's always concern about the table as we are here to win games,\" said Wenger.\n\"We had so much of the ball, but it was very frustrating because we could even have lost it at the end.\"\nGunners run out of ideas\nThis is the first time the Gunners have gone three league games without a win since April.\nThe statistics demonstrate that Wenger's side predictably dominated possession but they did not create enough chances as France forward Giroud, starting in place of leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette, failed to mark his first league start of the season with a goal.\nWenger named three academy graduates in his starting line-up - Jack Wilshere, who was making his first league start for the club since 15 May 2016, Iwobi and Ainsley Maitland-Niles.\nYet Arsenal, who are closer in terms of points to the bottom of the table than they are the top, lacked the quality, composure and ideas to unlock the second worst defence in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners managed just three shots on target despite enjoying 70% possession - including Sanchez forcing Adrian into a full-stretch save from a free-kick - but, in truth, West Ham were rarely troubled.\nWilshere blazed another good opening over as Arsenal failed to find a solution to their poor away form.\nWenger's side have won just two of their nine top-flight games away from the Emirates this season, with eight different clubs earning more points away from home in the league than Arsenal.\nIt will therefore perhaps be a relief to the Frenchman that Arsenal's next three games are all at home.\nWest Ham responding to Moyes\nWest Ham have still only won once in 10 league games and failed to have a single shot on target in a Premier League home match for the first time since August 2013.\nYet this performance, on the back of last weekend's win, nevertheless provided further evidence the Hammers are improving under Moyes.\nThey were compact, well organised and hard working off the ball.\nAngelo Ogbonna and Aaron Creswell typified West Ham's dogged determination with a string of vital blocks and clearances.\nThat kind of commitment helped a defence that conceded 32 goals in the first 15 games record back-to-back clean sheets against Chelsea and Arsenal.\nAnd it might have been even better for the Hammers.\nHernandez came off the bench with eight minutes to go and almost scored a stoppage-time winner.\nArsenal's defence did not clear properly, allowing the former Manchester United forward to shoot from 12 yards but he hit the underside of the bar, the ball bouncing off the line and back into play.\nAfter a narrow defeat to leaders Manchester City, a win against Chelsea and a hard-earned point against Arsenal, West Ham will hope to maintain their momentum against teams in the bottom half of the table.\nThey are at Stoke City on Saturday before hosting Newcastle and then travelling to Bournemouth.\nBy the time West Brom visit in their first game of 2018 the transfer window will be open, and Hammers co-owner David Sullivan stated in his programme notes that the club will be making \"two or three\" new signings in January.\nMan of the match - Mark Noble (West Ham)\nTravel sick Gunners - the stats\nOnly once in Premier League history have Arsenal won fewer than nine points from their first nine away games of a season (eight in 2005-06).\nArsenal have kept a clean sheet in two of their past three Premier League away games, as many as they had kept in their previous 14 on the road.\nAlexis Sanchez had more shots (six) and created more chances (four) than any other player in the match.\nOlivier Giroud has scored in just one of his last eight Premier League starts for Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nMoyes' Hammers are away to fellow strugglers Stoke City on Saturday (15:00 GMT) while at the same time Arsenal will hope to return to winning ways at home to Newcastle United."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-3 Crystal Palace\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson said Christian Benteke delivered on a pledge to make amends for his penalty miss last weekend as the Eagles climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone with a rare away win over Claude Puel's resurgent Leicester.\nBenteke cost Palace victory over Bournemouth when the injury-time spot-kick he was not supposed to take was saved, but the striker redeemed himself by opening the scoring against the Foxes with a first-half header from Andros Townsend's cross - his first goal of the campaign.\nHodgson said Benteke \"held his hands up\" in training after last week's match and had promised to \"make things up\" to his team-mates.\n\"That's exactly what he has done,\" Hodgson added. \"He's a quality striker and it wasn't just his goal that pleased me about his performance.\"\nPalace had failed to score in their past 10 league away games but added a second goal of an organised and adventurous performance before the break when Benteke's strong run and pass set up Wilfried Zaha for a brilliant individual finish.\nLeicester only tested goalkeeper Julian Speroni when they rallied in the second half - the Argentine reacting superbly to reach Riyad Mahrez's angled low drive with a strong palm.\nAnd any potential comeback was hamstrung when Wilfred Ndidi was sent off on his birthday less than a minute after Vicente Iborra's header was correctly disallowed for a foul.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nRelive Leicester v Crystal Palace\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nNdidi - who turns 21 today - was shown a second yellow card for simulation in the penalty box with just under half an hour to play.\nPalace had a much more legitimate penalty shout when Benteke was crumpled in the area by Marc Albrighton's sliding tackle from behind, but the referee waved away appeals for a chance to add extra gloss on an impressive away display.\nBakary Sako eventually provided it - tucking away Ruben Loftus-Cheek's pass across goal to round off a 94th-minute counter-attack.\nThe Foxes, who so impressively dismantled Puel's former club Southampton in midweek, remain eighth in the table, while Palace rise four places to 14th.\nPalace finally find the net\nPalace had taken 90 shots over 10 games without finding the net away from home in the league - their last away goals came in a 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield under Sam Allardyce in April.\nIt was the longest such run since 1949-50 - when Manchester City went 12 top-flight matches without scoring away - and was broken by Benteke, who himself had failed to score from 28 attempts in his past 13 matches.\nIn truth, as 10-man Leicester poured forward in the game's closing stages, Palace - and Benteke in particular - could easily have scored more than three.\nAnother Benteke header was kept out by an acrobatic Kasper Schmeichel star-jump save at the far post, and the Belgium striker also saw a shot diverted just wide by Wes Morgan's last-ditch block.\nBut in the end, it didn't even matter that Townsend shot horribly over the bar after another late counter.\nHodgson took over with Palace without a goal or a point from their opening five league matches, but his side are now eight games unbeaten having not lost since a 1-0 defeat at Tottenham on 5 November.\nIt is their best run in the English top flight since a series of 12 games without defeat was ended in October 1990.\nFoxes fail to fire\nOnly Manchester City and Burnley had won more points than Leicester's tally of 17 from Puel's first eight matches in charge - and the Foxes went into his ninth game having won each of their past four.\nBut while Palace looked dangerous every time they went forward - Zaha, Townsend, Loftus-Cheek and Yohan Cabaye all conspiring around target man Benteke - Leicester were easily snuffed out by the away side's aggressive defence.\nThe isolated Jamie Vardy was far from his waspish best, while Mahrez - a spectator in the first half - lost the ball in midfield five minutes before half-time to spark the move with which Palace doubled their lead.\nZaha, who had already threatened with several promising runs, expertly took Benteke's pass in his stride, regained his balance, slid past the covering Ben Chilwell with a stepover and fired the ball past Schmeichel.\nIt was a brilliant goal, but few would have anticipated the gulf between Leicester's sluggish showing on Saturday and Wednesday's 4-1 victory at Southampton.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\nUnwelcome birthday cards - the stats\nRoy Hodgson has never lost a competitive match against Leicester as a manager (P5 W4 D1 L0).\nNdidi became the fourth player to be sent off on his birthday in a Premier League game, after Dwight Gayle (17 October 2015 against West Ham), Gerry Taggart (18 October 1997 v West Ham) and Les Ferdinand (8 December 1993 against Liverpool).\nPalace have kept three straight away clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time.\nSince making his Premier League debut in September 2012, Benteke has scored 24 headed goals - only Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud (27) has netted more in the competition in this period.\nBenteke's vow - what the managers said\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson, speaking to BBC Sport: \"[Benteke] was very strong. The day after [Benteke's penalty miss] he came in and held his hand up, he spoke to the players and myself and made the point that he would make it up to team, and that is what he has done.\n\"We did feel a bit marooned [at the bottom of the table], there was a time when we were looking up at everyone above us and the gap was massive.\n\"But since then we have started playing the way we have over the past few games, and if we can produce performances like this all the way until May, at least we will have given ourselves a chance.\n\"I can't say I'm surprised [by the win] - we've had good results away from home where a victory would not have been totally out of order. It's good to get it today because the longer that run goes on the more you keep getting reminded of it.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was not a good day for us. We did not start well, we played without intensity. We played a good team with confidence - Palace deserved this win, they played very well.\n\"We needed to be more aggressive. We needed more good play, more intensity and quality.\n\"We tried to react in the second half. Ndidi was sent off and after we tried but it was too difficult for us to come back in this condition and we conceded a third goal, which was a little harsh for us.\n\"For us, it is a good lesson for the future. Now it is time to look forward.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Manchester City in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday (19:45 GMT kick-off), before a home Premier League game against Manchester United on 23 December (19:45).\nCrystal Palace's next match is away at Swansea in a 15:00 kick-off in the Premier League on Saturday."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-4 Huddersfield Town\nHuddersfield Town boss David Wagner said his side are halfway to Premier League survival after their 4-1 win at Watford.\nThis was the Terriers' first victory in eight away league matches and took Wagner's team up to 11th in the table on 21 points.\nHuddersfield are playing in their first Premier League season after winning the Championship play-off final in May, but their latest success was their sixth league win of 2017-18 after victories over Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Manchester United, West Brom and Brighton.\n\"We are in the race [to stay up] and nobody thought we would be - this is what makes us happy,\" said Wagner.\n\"You need 12 wins I believe to stay up and we have six.\n\"We played well, scored some wonderful goals and had other opportunities - the players performed to their best.\"\nHuddersfield's Elias Kachunga scored his first Premier League goal when he tapped in after Watford had failed to clear a corner.\nThe visitors doubled their lead after only 23 minutes when a cross from the excellent Collin Quaner hit Aaron Mooy six yards out and went into the net.\nHornets captain Troy Deeney was shown a straight red card for a lunge on Quaner in the 33rd minute and Huddersfield added a third when Laurent Depoitre capitalised on a slip from Jose Holebas and smashed the ball past Heurelho Gomes.\nHuddersfield skipper Jonathan Hogg was dismissed for two bookable offences and Watford's Abdoulaye Doucoure pulled a goal back with a superb 25-yard half-volley.\nHowever, the visitors added a late fourth as Mooy grabbed his second goal when he converted a penalty after Doucoure fouled Depoitre in the area.\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nRelive Huddersfield's win over Watford as it happened\nAnalysis and reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nHuddersfield finally win away from home\nHuddersfield started the Premier League campaign with a 3-0 win at Crystal Palace on 12 August, but had not won or even scored an away goal since.\nThat goalless and winless run - which consisted of seven Premier League games and a Carabao Cup tie - ended in style at Vicarage Road, although each of their opening three goals had an element of good fortune.\nKachunga finished from close range after Watford had failed to clear a corner for the opening goal, but Kachunga had looked to be in an offside position before he steered in Quaner's effort.\nQuaner was again involved in the build-up to the second - his cross from the byeline hitting Mooy, who did not know too much about it.\nAnd for the third goal, Holebas slipped in the penalty area to allow Depoitre to finish.\nBut there was no luck needed for the fourth goal as Mooy dispatched a well-struck penalty after Doucoure's trip on Depoitre for his second of the afternoon.\nThe only down side for Huddersfield were first-half injuries to Kachunga and Chris Lowe. Terriers boss David Wagner said Kachunga's knee injury \"looks serious\" and came as he tried to get on to a cross, but appeared to kick the ground and landed badly before he was carried off on a stretcher.\nHornets' poor discipline shows again\nFor the third successive game - and for the fourth time this season - Watford were reduced to 10 men.\nDeeney was dismissed after only 33 minutes for a rash lunge at Quaner, who was near the touchline trying to shield the ball from Etienne Capoue and not in a dangerous position.\nThe Hornets captain argued he did not deserve a red card, but is now set to serve a three-game ban - meaning he will miss the away game at Brighton on 23 December and then home matches against Leicester on 26 December and Swansea four days after that.\nNo side has had more players sent off than Watford this season - Deeney's red card following dismissals for Marvin Zeegelaar and Tom Cleverley against Burnley and Crystal Palace respectively earlier this month, and Miguel Britos against Brighton in August.\nWatford also had Holebas sent off in a Carabao Cup tie against Bristol City in August and boss Marco Silva will surely be concerned with his side's disciplinary record.\nThe Hornets were handed a way back into the match when Hogg was dismissed for two bookings after fouls on Andre Carillo and Richarlison.\nDoucoure's spectacular strike gave them hope of an incredible fightback, but Watford could not build on that as their winless run now extended to five.\nMan of the match - Aaron Mooy (Huddersfield)\nRed again for Watford - the stats\nThis was the first top-flight meeting between Watford and Huddersfield.\nThe Hornets are winless in their past five league games, losing four of them.\nThe Terriers had equalled a club record of seven away league games without a goal since they won 3-0 at Crystal Palace on the opening day of the season, before scoring four on Saturday.\nKachunga's goal ended Huddersfield's run of 59 consecutive shots away from home in the Premier League without scoring.\nWatford have the most Premier League red cards this season (four) and also the most since the start of last term (nine).\nThey are the first team to be given a red card in three successive Premier League matches since West Ham in August 2015.\n'We had a feeling this was around the corner' - what they said\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"We were focused on defence and good in offence. Watford have problems at the minute with suspensions and injuries.\n\"They are a top team - but we were good as well. We always had the feeling this was just around the corner.\nOn Hogg's red card: \"I would say if Watford didn't get the red card I am unsure if we would get a second yellow for Hogg. We have to accept it. This game is too great for us to discuss referee decisions.\"\nWatford manager Marco Silva: \"The result is bad for us. At this moment, what I can talk about and what I want to talk about is congratulating our opponent. We need to keep working hard. The past two games we can't change - but we can change the next. This is the moment to look forward and continue to work hard.\n\"I cannot talk about the attitude of the players. We reacted with 10 players. It is not a matter of attitude or commitment it is about the moments. We should do and must do better in situations.\n\"I am 100% happy with my job. The Premier League is 38 games not only 10. We need to keep going and to work to take results in the next game. You need to react to bad moments.\"\nOn whether the Hornets have a disciplinary problem: \"No. It is the same as with the first goal. You ask me about that because you know what happened. And you know what happened with the red. I don't want to talk about officials.\nWhat's next?\nWatford are at Brighton in the league on Saturday, 23 December (15:00 GMT kick-off), with Huddersfield away at Southampton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle United\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez said his side \"need something in January\" after they dropped into the relegation zone with a fourth straight defeat at Arsenal.\nThe Magpies have lost eight of their last nine Premier League games, gaining just one point from a 2-2 draw at West Brom.\nThey rose to as high as fourth earlier in the season, and were in sixth place after beating Crystal Palace on 21 October, their last win to date.\n\"We'll try to bring in some additions that will bring a lift to the team,\" said Benitez.\nMesut Ozil's brilliant volleyed goal in the first half was enough for Arsene Wenger's side, who dominated until Newcastle rallied late in the game.\nNewcastle are reported to be the subject of a \u00a3300m takeover bid by PCP Partners, with club owner Mike Ashley said to have recently met with PCP's owner Amanda Staveley.\n\"The fans know the team will be tough. They also know we need something in January that will help the current squad,\" the Spaniard added.\nAinsley Maitland-Niles hit the side-netting for Arsenal before the break, but Newcastle only came to life in the latter stages, with Ayoze Perez failing to take advantage of two rare chances when he put a shot and then a header over the bar.\nThe result puts Arsenal into fourth place while Newcastle have now claimed just one point from the last 27.\nJack Wilshere came closest to giving Arsenal breathing space late on when he saw his side-footed shot saved by the recalled Rob Elliot in the Newcastle goal.\nIt was Newcastle's 10th straight Premier League defeat to Arsenal and they are now without a league win since 21 October when they beat Crystal Palace 1-0.\nEdgy Arsenal relieved by Ozil brilliance\nSeventh in the table at kick-off and without a win in three matches is not the sort of run-in to the busy festive schedule that Arsenal are accustomed to.\nAnd hamstring and groin injuries to Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott respectively also gave Wenger much to ponder in the lead-up to the meeting with Newcastle.\nThey looked slick for much of the afternoon and threatened around the edge of Newcastle's area on a regular basis, but the lack of the killer instinct in front of goal led to some edginess as the match wore on.\nOzil's moment of magic was the one real ray of light on a grey afternoon, the Germany international showing impeccable technique and balance to strike the ball beyond a helpless Elliot after Newcastle failed to clear.\nWith Liverpool the next league visitors to the Emirates, Arsenal will be thankful for the split second of brilliance that helped to end a worrying dip in results.\nNewcastle's slide continues\nWhen Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles forced Petr Cech into a save when he rose unmarked to head a free-kick on target early on, Rafael Benitez must have hoped it was a sign of things to come.\nBut Newcastle retreated into their shells for much of the match, and struggled to chase the game after falling behind.\nTheir slide down the table, from sixth when they beat Palace for their last victory, has been badly timed, coinciding with the stories of PCP's interest.\nMagpies fans will want matters resolving soon, and will be in full agreement with their manager over the dire need for an injection of fresh talent in the forthcoming transfer window to spark their side back to life.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\n'Newcastle produced a physical performance' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"We had our chances. We were pushing and attacking. We had chances to draw. It's a pity. We are learning. In some games we are one goal behind. The players are working hard. It's a pity.\n\"We need to be competitive like today and keep going. We are a young team. When you're not winning you lose confidence. We have to keep working this way.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"The necessity to win was playing on the mind of the players towards the end.\n\"We had three games in six days. In the last one you could suffer because Newcastle produced a physical performance.\n\"We had two away games and two draws. Against Manchester United we had a quality performance but couldn't get the win.\"\nHome is where the heart is for Arsenal - the stats you may have missed\nArsenal have won 13 of their last 14 home Premier League games, losing the other to Manchester United.\nNewcastle are without a win in nine Premier League games (D1 L8), their longest winless run in league football since May 2015 (10).\nRafa Benitez has never enjoyed a victory away to Arsenal in the Premier League in seven attempts, drawing two and losing five.\nJack Wilshere started consecutive Premier League games for Arsenal for the first time since May 2015.\nMesut Ozil has been directly involved in six goals in his last five Premier League games at the Emirates (two goals, four assists).\nOzil has had a hand in three goals in his three top-flight appearances against Newcastle (2 goals, 1 assist).\nThe German created eight goal-scoring chances - only Kevin de Bruyne (nine v Southampton in November) has managed more in a single Premier League game this season. Ozil also managed eight v Everton in October.\nPetr Cech has now kept 199 Premier League clean sheets.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal face West Ham for the second time inside a week when they host the Carabao Cup quarter-final at 19:45 GMT on Tuesday, 19 December. The Gunners then host Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in the Premier League on Friday, 22 December at 19:45.\nNewcastle are back in London for their next outing, away to West Ham on Saturday, 23 December at 15:00 GMT."

I can have my opinion and this I have given to the technical director, to the chairman.\n\"After, the board can decide altogether which is the best for the team.\"\nCharlie Austin - with two goals in three games prior to Saturday's defeat - was another to find himself left out, but it was the striker's arrival on the hour mark that seemed to offer Saints their most likely route back into the match.\nHe forced a save from Thibaut Courtois with his first touch and managed Southampton's only other shot on target, though Chelsea were never really troubled.\nSouthampton are now just three points above the relegation zone, with the visit of Huddersfield next Saturday taking on added importance before tricky trips to Tottenham on 26 December and Manchester United four days later.\nMan of the match - Marcos Alonso (Chelsea)\n'We needed a second goal to relax' - what they said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"When you do not score the second goal, you have to suffer. You are afraid at every corner and free-kick and the opponent has the chance to draw.\n\"We dominated the game, shooting 24 times and hitting the post, and we needed to score the second goal to be relaxed. If you shoot only twice and score two goals, you must be worried. We had lots of shots but we must be more accurate in our finishing.\n\"In the past 10 games, we have won eight, drawn one and lost one. This is our run, you have to consider the last 10 games, not just two. It shows we are doing our job.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was a difficult game - especially in the second half we suffered a lot. When you play with five defenders, you do not have a lot of people in the middle and they managed the ball more.\n\"The quality of the goal was good, but maybe we can learn more from there. It is not easy to have many chances against Chelsea. We had three clear chances but could not score.\n\"The team is training well, the mentality is good and we are fighting. We are creating a good atmosphere to try and bounce back from this situation. Football is tight but we have another opportunity next Saturday.\"\nBuy a ticket, win the raffle - the stats\nAlonso has had a hand in 14 goals for Chelsea (10 goals, four assists) - more than any other Premier League defender.\nOnly striker Morata (49) has attempted more shots in the Premier League for Chelsea this season than Alonso (34).\nChelsea have scored seven direct free-kicks under Conte in all competitions, more than any other Premier League side since the start of last season.\nSouthampton have only won two of their 41 away top-flight matches against the reigning champions - they beat Leeds United in March 1970 and Chelsea in October 2015.\nSouthampton have kept one clean sheet in their past 25 Premier League games against the Blues.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday (19:45 GMT kick-off), before visiting Everton in the Premier League next Saturday (12:30).\nSouthampton welcome Huddersfield in the league on 23 December (15:00)."

Glenn is reliable and what we look for more is an all-round performance. [If we had scored] it would have released the pressure of having not scored many recently and we might have got a couple more.\n\"Burnley are in the best form they've probably ever been in and it was a tough test today.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It's a good point and to have three straight clean sheets and seven points from our last three games in the Premier League is very pleasing.\n\"They [Brighton] are on a tough run and made a few changes from in the week.

The guy's dived. He's drawn the challenge. He's a clever player. It was clearly a dive and the ref's seen something that no-one else saw. All in all, it was a poor sequence of events for him and for us.\n\"It sounds like sour grapes when you talk about people getting punished retrospectively. It doesn't help us now.\"\nNoble converted the penalty, while Austria international Arnautovic should have had a hat-trick, hitting the woodwork twice in the second half before finally finishing with his right foot into the bottom corner after a deft exchange of passes with Lanzini.\nSubstitute Sakho compounded Stoke's woes when he collected the influential Lanzini's through ball and slotted coolly past keeper Jack Butland.\n'Arnie' silences Stoke fans' boos\nThey call Marko Arnautovic 'Arnie' at London Stadium, and the Austrian shares a steely determination with some of his Hollywood namesake's biggest movie roles.\nHe was booed relentlessly by Stoke fans unable to forgive him for his \u00a320m summer move to the capital.\nBut the 28-year-old, who was told he must work harder or risk being dropped when David Moyes arrived in November, used the barracking as motivation.\nHe braved the catcalls after he missed several strong chances, and hit the bar twice, and kept plugging away without letting his head drop.\nWhen he was replaced on 79 minutes former boss Hughes demanded he hurry off the pitch and a Stoke scarf was thrown at the striker from the stands.\nArnautovic's response? He gave jubilant West Ham fans in the away end the Hammers' crossed-arm 'irons' symbol and headed straight down the tunnel.\nJust not enough spark for Stoke\nThey are having a party at Stoke's stadium tonight.\nMore than 500 partygoers will toast the festive season at a pre-booked corporate event, but the Potters fans among them will not feel much like celebrating.\nThis latest setback against fellow strugglers puts even more pressure on next Saturday's similarly high-stake game against second-bottom West Brom and also on manager Mark Hughes.\nStoke chairman Peter Coates has denied Hughes is facing the sack\n, external\n, but the problems are mounting for a side who are now one point and one place above the relegation zone.\nLuck appears to have abandoned them with big officiating decisions, such as the close call for Noble's penalty.\nThey are also not helped by their over-reliance on playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri to provide a spark - he is just not being supported enough by other forwards.\nFinally, they keep conceding softly - they have now gone behind first in their last five outings.\nHere their best chances fell to captain Ryan Shawcross, who could not get a string of headers on target.\nSomething must change or the mood will continue to darken in Stoke, like the lights at the stadium when the power went before kick-off.\nMan of the match - Manuel Lanzini (West Ham)\n'We're gaining momentum' - what they said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes told Match of the Day: \"The result went our way and it was an important win. We're gaining momentum and at times we showed that.\nOn the penalty: \"The defender gave the referee a decision to make. Manuel Lanzini ran about 70 yards so I think he went over with fatigue rather than a dive. I'd be disappointed to give away a penalty like that but sometimes that's the way it goes.\n\"We had to deal with a lot of stuff but we missed good chances. I was annoyed with Marko at half-time as he had the chance to get two. He's doing really well and I said to him at half-time he would score.\n\"Clean sheets are one of the things you want to do. Don't shout about it too much as we're going to need a few more.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes on Match of the Day: \"We huffed and puffed, up to the point of the second goal we were in it. We were damaged by a poor decision - it allowed them to get people behind the ball. They're a threat on the attack and in the end that's what's taken the game from us.\n\"When we try and be expansive we can't go one v one, we get picked off. We've got to be better in that regard.\"\nOne clean sheet in 16 for Stoke - the stats\nStoke have kept just one clean sheet in their last 16 Premier League games.\nThis is the first time since March 2014 (Manchester United) that a side managed by David Moyes has kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League.\nStoke City have lost five of their last six matches in the Premier League, winning the other.\nManuel Lanzini provided two assists and won the penalty in this match - it is only the second time that Lanzini has assisted two goals in a single Premier League game (also against Middlesbrough in January 2017).\nMarko Arnautovic is the third player to score against Stoke in the Premier League having previously played for them in the competition (also Wilfried Bony and Seyi Olofinjana).\nThis was Stoke City's 50th home defeat in the Premier League.\nMark Noble made his 300th appearance for West Ham United, the first player to reach this milestone for the club in the Premier League.\nOf Mark Noble's 34 Premier League goals, 19 have come from the penalty spot (56%).\nWhat's next?\nStoke City host West Brom next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while West Ham are at the Emirates to play Arsenal in their Caribao Cup quarter-final on Tuesday (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 4-1 Tottenham Hotspur\nPep Guardiola said Kevin de Bruyne is helping Manchester City become \"a better institution\" after the playmaker put in an inspired performance to help his side outclass Tottenham for a 16th successive Premier League victory that stretched their lead to 14 points.\nIlkay Gundogan, in for the absent David Silva, headed City in front from a corner after 14 minutes and the only surprise was that it took until 20 minutes before time until man-of-the-match De Bruyne's powerful shot extended their advantage.\nGabriel Jesus struck the post with a penalty after Jan Vertonghen fouled De Bruyne but Raheem Sterling crowned a sweeping move with a simple finish to put the game well and truly out of Spurs' reach.\nSterling then took advantage of Eric Dier's mistake to walk in the fourth for his 15th goal of the season before Spurs - for whom Harry Kane and Dele Alli were lucky not to get red cards from referee Craig Pawson for challenges on Sterling and De Bruyne respectively - pulled one back in stoppage time through Christian Eriksen.\nBoss Guardiola singled out De Bruyne for praise as he highlighted the Belgium international's work without the ball, calling it \"a good example for the young players, for our academy\".\n\"They know how good Kevin De Bruyne is and when they see how he runs and fights without the ball, that is the best example,\" added Guardiola.\n\"He helps us to be a better club, a better institution for the future, because that is what we want to do. His performance, I have no words to describe what he has done with the ball.\n\"And overall, without the ball, he is able to make pressure from 40 metres to the goalkeeper. And when that happens, the people who are behind him think 'if that guy runs like this, I have to run as well'.\"\nHow can anyone stop Manchester City?\nIt is the question being asked on a weekly basis - and no-one is any nearer finding the answer after another imperious performance from a City side who are surely now too far ahead to be caught in the Premier League title race.\nJose Mourinho went for a cautious approach with Manchester United in Sunday's derby at Old Trafford and was unpicked by the magic of David Silva as City won 2-1.\nSilva was absent here and Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham adopted a more positive outlook - but this time the brilliant De Bruyne was the inspiration as another method was tried and failed against Guardiola's almost flawless side.\nCity swarmed all over Spurs, with goalkeeper Hugo Lloris often put under pressure in possession and in the end it was quite simply all too much for Pochettino's side, as it has been for pretty much everyone this season.\nOnly Everton have taken a point against City this season with a 1-1 draw in the second league game of the season at Etihad Stadium - and it is difficult to see how this winning run can be stopped as they play with such threat and variety.\nEven when City are threatened, Guardiola has successfully solved a problem which dogged his first season at the club with the acquisition of an excellent goalkeeper in Brazilian Ederson.\nWhen Spurs looked dangerous for a brief period at the start of the second half, Ederson made a superb flying save to his right from Harry Kane.\nIf there is a weakness in this City side no-one has yet found it.\nDe Bruyne's masterclass\nSilva may have been missing but this Manchester City side has more than enough brilliance to rely on one player - and it was De Bruyne who orchestrated the destruction of Spurs.\nThe Belgian had simply too much in his armoury, even shrugging off Dele Alli's crude challenge which left the England midfielder fortunate only to get a yellow card from referee Pawson.\nIndeed, De Bruyne turned his anger on Spurs, scoring City's second shortly after with a shot that was too fierce for keeper Lloris, drawing a foul from countryman Jan Vertonghen to earn the penalty that Jesus missed and playing a part in setting up the third for Sterling.\nSpurs, like many before them, found that if they closed down one option, Manchester City found another.\nAnd at the heart of it all was De Bruyne, now a world-class talent in a truly outstanding team.\nGuardiola added: \"The performance of Kevin de Bruyne, you cannot imagine how good he plays with the ball, but he runs like a player in the Conference league - it is easier for the manager and the club.\"\n'His feet are like paintbrushes'\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown on Match of the Day:\nKevin de Bruyne's feet are like paintbrushes, he's an artist. He's a thinking footballer, so creative, he creates chances for everyone and he'll take his own when he gets them.\nHe'll work hard for you as well. Young kids watching this, he's not admiring passes. He wants to get after things, there's an energy and desire in his football.\nHe wants to work hard, he's giving his manager everything, he's on fire - the world is his oyster at the moment. He's taking people out of their seats. The calibre of football he's playing is outstanding.\nSpurs disappoint again - Alli most of all\nSpurs were yet again found wanting on their travels against a team they had hoped to be challenging for the Premier League title.\nAs at Manchester United and Arsenal this season, Spurs never looked like securing the sort of statement victory that suggests they could bridge the gap from Premier League runners-up last season to champions this term.\nSince they won 2-1 here in February 2016, they have not won in 10 away games against other teams in the so-called \"big six\", losing six and drawing four.\nIt is a telling statistic - although Pochettino is unlikely to believe it is because his players are struggling to climb a psychological barrier.\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of this defeat was the lack of impact from Alli, whose main contribution was that spiteful tackle on De Bruyne.\nHe was a peripheral figure and was roundly booed by City's fans when he was unsurprisingly substituted late on.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\n'Thanks to the club for these amazing players'\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"They have good quality, but we played really good to beat one of the strongest teams in the Premier League.\n\"Without the ball we are a humble team.\"\nOn City's record winning run: \"Since August we are so happy and I admire the most the way we play without the ball - thank you to the club to provide me with these amazing players.\n\"We are on a good streak, but in three days we have another one.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think it was a good experience for the team, when you win and play well you maybe don't learn, so you must learn this type of game. We have a lot of positive things, because we played a team in very good form with very good momentum.\n\"It wasn't bad at the start, but the way we conceded from a corner was a big mistake and a massive present for them. When you play a team in very good form, you cannot give away these gifts.\n\"When you're playing a team with good quality, if we take risks, we give them the possibility of making chances. We tried to play, but they were better, we have to congratulate them. So far, they are the best team in England.\"\nCity prove again to be Lloris' bogey side\nGuardiola is still three victories away from his best-ever winning streak in league football as a manager - 19 consecutive wins with Bayern Munich between October 2013 and March 2014.\nSince taking over at White Hart Lane in August 2014, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has enjoyed just one victory in his 18 Premier League games away to the 'big six' (W1 D6 L11).\nTottenham's first shot on target came in the 55th minute, the longest they've had to wait in a Premier League game this season.\nTottenham directed just two shots on target in the game, compared to Manchester City's 11, the biggest negative difference for the Lilywhites in a Premier League game since December 2013 against Liverpool (-10).\nSane has been directly involved in 11 goals in eight Premier League home games this season (five goals, six assists), more than any other player.\nDe Bruyne has been directly involved in 14 goals in his 15 Premier League appearances since the start of September (six goals, eight assists).\nGundogan's opener was the 200th Premier League goal Lloris has conceded (203 in total now); 25 of them have come against Manchester City.\nWhat's next?\nCity are at Leicester on Tuesday in the Carabao Cup quarter-final (19:45 GMT) and then host Bournemouth in the league next Saturday at 15:00. Tottenham are at Burnley next Saturday (17:30).\nRelive the action from the Etihad Stadium"

We really deserved it and I enjoyed the performance.\"\nCoutinho, who had earlier hit the post with a free-kick, put the visitors ahead with a fine individual goal and Lovren headed in a second six minutes later.\nJermain Defoe hit the post for Bournemouth, but Salah made it 3-0 before half-time after an excellent jinking run.\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain also hit the woodwork before Firmino headed in from Coutinho's cross to seal the impressive win for Klopp's side.\nThe victory extends Liverpool's unbeaten run in all competitions to 12 matches, while Bournemouth have not won in six games.\nPodcast: 'Liverpool playing exquisite football'\nAnalysis and reaction from Sunday's Premier League matches\nSensational Liverpool far too good for Bournemouth\nLiverpool took only 20 minutes to break down Bournemouth, and it came from a piece of magic from Coutinho as he scored his fifth goal in as many games.\nThere looked to be little danger when the Brazilian collected the ball 35 yards out, close to the left touchline, but, with the Bournemouth defenders backtracking, Coutinho was allowed to run at the home defence, before he jinked inside a challenge and slotted the ball past Asmir Begovic.\nIt became two soon afterwards after some sloppy Bournemouth defending.\nA corner from the left was flicked on by Georginio Wijnaldum, but the home defence stopped, thinking the ball was going out of play, and Firmino hooked the ball back into the danger zone for the unmarked Lovren to score with a diving header.\nIn this fixture last season, Bournemouth trailed 2-0 and 3-1 before winning 4-3, but there was no repeat this time around.\nSalah got his 11th goal in 11 games, and his 20th of the season, with an excellent individual goal to kill the game off after only 44 minutes.\nFirmino got the goal he deserved with a diving header for the fourth, although he had looked to be in an offside position when he met Coutinho's fine cross.\nWith the three points wrapped up, Klopp took the opportunity to give some playing time for England midfielder Adam Lallana, who came on for the last 19 minutes for only his second substitute appearance of the season after a thigh injury sustained in the summer.\nBournemouth's concerns increase\nFor Eddie Howe's Bournemouth, this was their sixth game without a victory and they remain 16th in the table, only one point above the relegation zone.\nSince putting four past Huddersfield on 18 November, the Cherries have only scored four times in six games, and they will be concerned that Joshua King, who netted 17 times in 2016-17, went off injured after only 31 minutes.\nDefoe had the best chance for the hosts when he was put through by substitute Junior Stanislas, but, with only goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to beat, the England international fired his shot against the foot of the post.\nHe also forced a fine second-half save from Mignolet, but the hosts' struggles in front of goal continue and no Bournemouth player has scored more than three Premier League goals in 2017-18.\nIt was also another disappointing home performance for a Bournemouth side who have only picked up eight points from their nine matches at the Vitality Stadium this season, with only bottom side Swansea picking up fewer points - seven - from their home games.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nLandmark for Salah - the stats\nBournemouth are winless in their last six league games (drawn three, lost three).\nMohamed Salah became the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals before Christmas since Ian Rush in 1986-87.\nNo side has scored more first-half Premier League goals this season than Liverpool's 19, although Manchester City have also scored 19 in the first half.\nBournemouth's 4-3 win in this fixture 12 months ago is their only triumph in 12 league and cup games against Liverpool (drawn three, lost eight).\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their last nine games in the Premier League (won six, drawn three) - their best run since an 11-match streak ended in November 2016.\nJurgen Klopp has made 69 changes to Liverpool's starting line-up in this season's Premier League. Last season he only made a total of 54 changes to his starting side in the league all season.\n'We left ourselves exposed' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We have to look at ourselves before we look at the opposition. We were flat, we never got going and we can't turn the ball over like we did because it is very difficult to defend when the numbers are against us.\n\"We are aware our style can leave us vulnerable and we left ourselves exposed at times. We didn't get our game going and when you don't perform against the top teams, you're going to get punished so it was very disappointing for us.\"\nOn Bournemouth being in a relegation fight, Howe added: \"It's going to be a tough challenge but I back us to come back strong from this. We're in the same position as always with a relegation fight, first year, second year, so we've been here before. We know we have to come through a tough Christmas schedule and come back stronger next year.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I am really pleased about everything, the start was serious, we knew how they can play if you let them. We were disciplined, I like how we defended different situations, and our tactical discipline was good. You can't score all the time, all the games are hard. It was a fantastic first goal, and the third was world class.\n\"We could have scored more, but we didn't really give a lot away so it was well deserved and I enjoyed the performances.\"\nAsked whether it was hard leaving players out, Klopp replied: \"It's not hard, I am not here to celebrate my squad. I like them but against West Brom they didn't hit the target.\n\"I don't change my mind in three minutes, but we have to be consistently good because we are Liverpool. I am completely happy having these boys around, Adam Lallana came on and made a difference immediately, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain creates pressure. But still, I can only line 11 up.\"\nWhat's next?\nAfter playing Manchester United and now Liverpool, Bournemouth's tough run of fixtures continues with a Carabao Cup quarter-final tie at Chelsea on Wednesday, 20 December (19:45 GMT), before an away Premier League game at leaders Manchester City on Saturday, 23 December (15:00 GMT).\nLiverpool's next two games both come in the Premier League. Firstly they play away at Arsenal on Friday, 22 December (19:45 GMT) before a home game against Swansea City on Boxing Day (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Everton 3-1 Swansea City\nStriker Wayne Rooney said Everton have \"gone back to basics\" after they came from behind to beat Swansea City 3-1 and continue their revival under Sam Allardyce.\nThe Toffees have won four of their past five games - drawing the other - to climb into ninth in the Premier League.\nRooney sealed Everton's victory from the penalty spot after Martin Olsson was adjudged to have fouled Jonjoe Kenny.\nIt was the former England captain's second spot-kick of the night - he had earlier had one saved by Lukasz Fabianski, though Dominic Calvert-Lewin turned home the rebound.\nThat brought the Toffees level after Leroy Fer had lost his marker at a corner to open the scoring for Swansea.\nGylfi Sigurdsson's exquisite long-range strike against his former club put Everton ahead after the break, before Rooney's penalty completed the scoring.\n\"I think the manager has got us back to basics,\" said Rooney. \"If we went a goal down, we had a feeling we wouldn't get back in the game earlier in the season. We are much more solid.\n\"We didn't play as well as we can do but we showed great character. Four weeks ago we would have lost that game. Hopefully over the Christmas period we can pick up a few more wins.\"\nMy job is getting harder - Swansea boss Clement\nSwansea, who lost striker Wilfried Bony to injury after just four minutes, will remain in the bottom three over Christmas as Paul Clement's problems worsen.\nThe visitors had started quickly, with a confidence that belied their lowly status and thrashing by Manchester City last week, looking to take advantage of a sluggish opening from the Merseysiders.\nLuciano Narsingh and Tom Carroll drew saves from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, but the hosts responded just before half-time when 20-year-old Calvert-Lewin reacted first to net his seventh goal of the season.\nSigurdsson's strike seemed to break Swansea's spirit before referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot for Rooney to score the third, with replays suggesting Kenny had been fouled just outside the area.\n\"I'm a confident person and believe in myself,\" said Rooney of his second spot-kick. \"If you look at the penalties I have missed, you will see I put a bit of top spin on the ball so someone could follow up. I'm not giving them up. The second one I put my foot through it.\n\"I have not set targets for goals, but I am in good goalscoring form and hope that can continue. I feel good and fit. The more I play the better I feel.\"\nRooney makes the difference again\nA penalty saved, one scored, an assist and a standing ovation.\nRooney's return to his boyhood club has been anything but dull so far - and his nerve, vision and fitness were once again key for Allardyce's upwardly mobile side.\nThe 32-year-old's start was muted in the Goodison mist, seeming heavy-legged and off the pace.\nWas he feeling the effects of starting each of the past four Premier League games? His response, eventually, was a clear no.\nFor such a prodigiously gifted striker of a football, his penalty record is oddly patchy - he has failed to score from 10 of his 33 Premier League spot-kicks.\nIt took guts to step up again in the second half after Fabianski had saved his earlier effort. But his strength of character and growing stamina shone through, as he ended with a more positive new statistic to savour.\nRooney is now third in the Premier League's all-time assist providers, the pass which found Sigurdsson for the second sumptuous goal putting him ahead of Frank Lampard and behind only Cesc Fabregas and Ryan Giggs.\nBright start - same old story\nFor teams such as Swansea, in an increasingly stark position at the foot of the table, every new corner turned can become a dead end with soul-destroying swiftness.\nThey started this contest with a verve and self-belief which certainly did not resemble a team that have scored fewer league goals than any other professional team in England or Wales.\nEven losing Bony to a hamstring injury so early did not unsettle Clement's men.\nYet fortune turned its back on the brave this time.\nRooney's soft penalty a minute before half-time rebounded to an Everton player. Then their former playmaker struck with a wonder goal that will cut deeply, before another harsh penalty was awarded against them.\nIt is not just tough-luck stories though.\nWhen that bright start fizzled out they did not have enough movement in the final third, and defensively they were slack; Kyle Naughton backing off Sigurdsson too easily and Olsson getting himself in the wrong position even if he impeded Kenny outside the area.\nTheir next match against a buoyant Crystal Palace feels pivotal.\n'I've simplified the game' - what they said\nEverton boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Radio 5 live: \"From a tactical point of view, I've simplified the game. And I'm man-managing the players. I brought some experienced and talented staff with me, along with the rest of the staff - I want everyone to get better. To turn around so quickly is great credit to everyone. Not just me.\n\"What looked like a desperate situation is becoming a comfortable one. And now people are looking up the table than down. The last clubs I took over were tougher to turn around initially.\n\"We've got to try to get a result against Chelsea and then we'll really know what we're made of. With this confidence if we can get a result there, we're on the right track for finishing as high as we can. Let's see if the lads can pull one out of the bag.\"\nSwansea boss Paul Clement told BBC Radio 5 live: \"The performance in the first half was encouraging until we gifted them a goal with the penalty. We have to manage the game better and see it out.\n\"That gave them belief. We didn't defend it very well. It was a clumsy challenge and gave them a good bit of motivation coming into half-time. I'm disappointed with the second goal - we were way too open. We had scored from a corner, but this time we played a short corner, then put a ball into the box and they broke from it.\n\"The third one summed our night up. Our defender should have been goal-side but he was outside the box, it should have been a free-kick, not a penalty. It was clear.\n\"The mood in the dressing room is very flat. We're bottom of the table on 12 points. We've got to focus on getting to 15 points at the halfway mark. We can't look further ahead than Saturday's game against Crystal Palace.\"\nMan of the match - Idrissa Gueye (Everton)\nComeback kings Everton - the stats\nEverton have come from behind to win 12 points in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nEverton have picked up 13 points from their past five Premier League games, one more than they managed in their previous 13 games this season (12).\nSwansea have now lost 19 Premier League away games since the start of last season; more than any other club.\nWilfried Bony was forced off in the fifth minute of the game, to be replaced by Tammy Abraham, making it the earliest substitution in the Premier League this season.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has been directly involved in 11 goals for Everton this season in all competitions (seven goals, four assists), a figure only Wayne Rooney can better (14).\nRooney has failed to score with 10 of his 33 Premier League penalty kicks overall, with only Alan Shearer failing to convert more (11 of 67).\nThe Toffees have won seven penalties this season in the top-flight, more than any other side (scoring five).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been directly involved in five goals in his last seven Premier League games (three goals, two assists), after failing to score or provide an assist in his first 10 this season\nWhat's next?\nEverton host Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday (12:30 GMT), while Swansea play Crystal Palace at the Liberty Stadium later that day (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-3 Liverpool\nRoberto Firmino's powerful finish earned Liverpool a draw in an incredible Premier League encounter that had seen Arsenal score three goals in just five second-half minutes.\nThe Gunners had been trailing 2-0 after Philippe Coutinho scored his first headed league goal in England before Mohamed Salah added a second early in the second half with a deflected strike.\nBut Arsenal suddenly came alive as Alexis Sanchez headed in Hector Bellerin's cross from close range before Granit Xhaka's thumping strike was too powerful for Simon Mignolet's weak save.\nBarely two minutes later Mesut Ozil put Arsenal ahead with a neat clip over Mignolet.\nPlay swung from one end of the pitch to the other at blistering pace, with both sides looking capable of scoring with every attack.\nBut it was Liverpool who had the final say in one of the most thrilling Premier League encounters in years as Petr Cech could only take the sting out of Firmino's shot and the ball bounced over the line.\nThe point meant Liverpool held onto fourth place, with Arsenal remaining fifth - a point behind the Reds.\nRe-live the thrilling encounter between Arsenal and Liverpool\nHow a crazy six minutes panned out\nThis had looked like being a routine win for Liverpool after a dominant first half.\nThey led through Coutinho's clever header and should have had more but for some uncharacteristically wasteful finishing by Sadio Mane and Salah.\nHowever, it was not long until the Premier League's top scorer had his 15th of the season, and so began an incredible six minutes...\n52 mins: Salah races on to Firmino's superb pass and makes it 2-0 with a deflected finish. Arsenal, who have not had a single shot on target, look beaten.\n53 mins: Out of nowhere, Arsenal are back in it. Sanchez is well placed to nod in Bellerin's cross from close range.\n56 mins: What's going on!? Arsenal are level! Xhaka tries his luck from 25 yards and the ball fizzes through Mignolet's hand.\n58 mins: Goals! Goals! Goals! Arsenal are ahead as Ozil is on to Alexandre Lacazette's backheel before clipping the ball over Mignolet.\n'Fab Four' deliver but defence doesn't\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is not too keen on the 'Fab Four' nickname that has been given to his attacking quartet of Coutinho, Salah, Mane and Firmino, but he might have to develop an acceptance for it as they continue to dominate the headlines.\nThree of them scored in this game and, in truth, all four should have been on the scoresheet, with Mane going for the acrobatic with a first-half scissor kick with Cech beaten.\nThe quartet have now collectively accounted for 29 of Liverpool's past 34 goals and while the Reds' attacking strength cannot be questioned - they have scored at least three goals in their past four Premier League away games - the defence can.\nLiverpool had conceded 16 goals in their first nine league games and while they had stemmed the tide in the games since the 4-1 defeat by Tottenham at the end of October, familiar frailties arose in this encounter as players switched off after conceding, while Mignolet should have done better with Xhaka's effort.\nA tale of two halves for Arsenal\nDavid de Gea's saves against Arsenal for Manchester United earlier this month appeared to have had a long-lasting impact on the Gunners.\nSince Jose Mourinho's side beat them 3-1 at the start of the month - with De Gea making 14 saves that day - Arsenal had struggled to convert shots into goals, having 56 attempts in the three Premier League games before Liverpool's visit, putting 12 of those on target and scoring just twice.\nIt was more of the same in the first half of this game as Mignolet enjoyed once of the easiest 45 minutes of his career. Arsenal managed just one shot - and that was wide of goal - but all that changed in the second half as they scored from all but one of their shots on target.\nThe Gunners were no doubt helped by Liverpool's poor defensive performance, but Arsene Wenger praised the character of his side to stage such a fightback.\n\"In the first half we were paralysed and frozen,\" said Wenger. \"We gave too many balls away and looked second best everywhere.\n\"In the second half we have shown quality, character and played at our level.\"\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino\n'Point is the minimum we deserve'\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"You need to be angry with yourself, not sad or insecure. We came back into the game and scored our third. The point is the minimum we deserve. Because of the intensity of the game it was not easy to create clearer chances. When you get a point at Arsenal it is usually OK but after this give me a few minutes to get there.\n\"Three goals at Arsenal should be enough. We defended most of the time pretty well. We did not give space away. After they score the first and the second, it is not easy but we need to deal with these situations better.\"\nAnother high-scoring encounter - the stats\nThere have been 27 goals scored in the past five Premier League meetings between these teams (10 for Arsenal, 17 for Liverpool) at an average of 5.4 per game.\nLiverpool have scored 54 away goals in all competitions in 2017, their most in a calendar year since 1982 (66).\nThere were just 388 seconds between Mo Salah putting Liverpool 2-0 ahead and Mesut Ozil scoring to make it 3-2 to Arsenal.\nArsenal have conceded seven goals in two league games against Liverpool this season - in only one Premier League campaign have they conceded more against an opponent (10 against Man Utd in 2011-12).\nSince Jurgen Klopp's first Premier League match in charge in October 2015, Liverpool's games have seen 279 goals scored (174 for, 105 against), more than any other club.\nPhilippe Coutinho has been involved in 16 goals in 11 away matches in all competitions (nine goals, seven assists).\nCoutinho scored his 53rd goal for Liverpool in all competitions - however, this was his first headed goal for the Reds.\nRoberto Firmino has been involved in eight goals in his past five Premier League appearances against Arsenal (five goals, three assists).\nFirmino has also scored and assisted in each of his past three Premier League games against the Gunners.\nWhat next?\nArsenal have a bit of time to enjoy the Christmas break. They are next in action on 28 December when they travel to Crystal Palace (20:00 GMT). Liverpool, meanwhile, have a shorter turnaround because they host Swansea on Boxing Day (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Everton 0-0 Chelsea\nEverton boss Sam Allardyce challenged his side to be more creative as he continued his unbeaten start to the job with a dogged and defensively strong goalless draw against champions Chelsea.\nThe ninth-placed Toffees have not lost in six Premier League games, five of those since Allardyce took charge.\nCaptain Phil Jagielka cleared off the line from Tiemoue Bakayoko and Willian in quick succession to frustrate the visitors, who were without suspended top scorer Alvaro Morata.\nChelsea dominated, but struggled to breach the Everton backline and found goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in good form when they did.\nThe 23-year-old England World Cup hopeful saved smartly from Pedro's effort in the first half and tipped a low Eden Hazard drive wide after the break.\nSubstitute Ashley Williams then headed against his own crossbar as the Toffees at times rode their luck to keep a fourth clean sheet in six games.\nAntonio Conte's Chelsea side stay third, having lost just once in their past 11 league games.\nEverton have picked up 11 points in five league games under Allardyce and conceded just twice, after letting in 28 in their previous 14.\n\"You join a club and there are lots of decisions to be made and you can't hang around too much,\" said Allardyce. \"Those decisions can take a bit longer now because of what the players have achieved on the field.\n\"The leaky side of this team has been put to bed - it was conceding fours, fives and sixes. Now it's about working on the other side of it in creative terms.\"\nToffees prove tough to beat\nAllardyce has promised his Everton players Christmas Day off, saying he hated having to come in for training then as a player, calling it \"a complete waste of time\".\nThe former England boss will feel it is a well-earned break for his side, who were without Wayne Rooney against Chelsea because of flu, while defenders Mason Holgate and Williams started on the bench because of illness.\nRooney has enjoyed a revival since his return to Goodison, scoring 10 goals in 16 league games - the quickest he has reached double figures since 2011-12. Williams has recovered from a shaky start to the season under Allardyce's guidance and youngster Holgate has impressed alongside him.\nBut Allardyce has instilled a solidity among this Everton side that means they are hard to break down whoever starts at the back.\nMichael Keane, returning to the side, was superb alongside Jagielka and the captain's double block on the line in the first half epitomised Everton's refusal to lose under their new boss as they restricted Chelsea to few clear-cut chances.\nThe hosts did, however, miss the subtlety Rooney brings to their direct approach under Allardyce, with his experience and composure to hold the ball up in attack.\nBut, despite having no shots on target, Everton remain unbeaten in six games with Allardyce's run now including draws against Chelsea and Liverpool.\nChelsea lack cutting edge\nWith Morata absent, Conte again opted for Hazard to lead the line rather than place his trust in out-and-out striker Michy Batshuayi.\nHazard occupied the role in last week's win over Southampton, with Morata recovering from a back injury, but his natural tendency is to drop deep and that meant much of Chelsea's play was in front of Everton's backline.\nThe visitors created space in wide positions through wing-backs Marcos Alonso and Victor Moses, but found Everton's well-drilled defence equal to that route of attack.\nWithout a focal point in the penalty box the visitors lacked a clinical edge, and their best chances came when Pedro broke free on the counter attack to force Pickford into a save, and Hazard found space to shoot from the edge of the box.\nConte did call for Batshuayi, whose last goals came for the club's under-21s in a Checkatrade Trophy win over MK Dons, with 20 minutes to go but the Belgium forward was denied any real opportunities.\nAnd Chelsea nearly paid the price for their inability to capitalise on their dominance, with Keane heading Everton's best chance of the game over the crossbar in injury time.\nMan of the match - Phil Jagielka (Everton)\nAllardyce shores up leaky Toffees\nEverton kept their first Premier League clean sheet in nine games against Chelsea, since a 1-0 win in September 2013.\nHowever, the Toffees have now failed to score in their past four Premier League games against Chelsea.\nEverton have kept three clean sheets in their five Premier League games under Allardyce - the same number they had kept in their previous 18 in the competition.\nChelsea have now had two goalless draws in the Premier League this season - they did not have a single one in Conte's first season in charge.\nChelsea had 25 shots in this match, their most in a Premier League game without scoring since January 2014 (39 vs West Ham).\nMeanwhile, Everton failed to have a single shot on target in a home Premier League game for the first time since 4 December 2011 v Stoke; 2,211 days ago.\n'It is an unfair result' - what they said\nEverton boss Sam Allardyce: \"I am delighted with the players' attitude and application to defending to stifle a side like this. It is a terrific point for us. We had a bit of fortune but got a well-deserved point.\n\"We didn't use the ball well enough to get up the pitch enough. We have to work on playing out from the back and holding the ball up.\"\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte on Sky Sports: \"We had 26 shots, only eight on target. I think we dominated the game and lots of chances to score. I think it is an unfair result. Everton deserve credit but we deserve to win.\n\"Maybe Jordan Pickford was the best player for them. We dominated the game and it is a pity to drop two points. It is normal to drop points with a poor performance but not today.\n\"It is not simple to dominate here, we needed a bit of luck.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to West Brom in the Premier League on 26 December, kick-off 15:00 GMT, while Chelsea host Brighton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Huddersfield Town\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner accused Southampton striker Charlie Austin of deliberately kicking keeper Jonas Lossl as his side came from behind to claim a Premier League point against their out-of-form hosts.\nAustin stooped low from a corner to score the opener, but was later lucky to stay on the field after catching Lossl in the face with a late, stray boot.\nWagner told BBC Sport: \"I will never say someone likes to hurt an opponent on purpose but to be honest it looks like this is the case. It should never happen.\n\"It looks very ugly from my point of view. I was a striker and I know Jonas was on the ball - so what you have to do is not touch him.\n\"It looked nasty and ugly. I am unsure what will happen now.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino defended his player, saying: \"I didn't see the action but Charlie does not have the intention to do this.\"\nAfter Austin opened the scoring, Laurent Depoitre levelled for the Terriers, heading home from close range following Tommy Smith's cross.\nDefender Maya Yoshida could have won it for the home side in stoppage time, but his header struck the foot of the post.\nRe-live the draw from St Mary's\nFurther action for Austin?\nJeers rang out from the home supporters at full-time after Southampton had let slip their lead at St Mary's. They have now won just one of their past 10 top-flight games and have failed to keep a clean sheet during that run.\nPellegrino's side have slipped to 13th in the division and are staring the wrong way, just three points above the relegation zone.\nIt was going well for the hosts when Austin headed in his fifth goal in his past five starts, but the afternoon turned sour for the former QPR player.\nHaving been played through on goal, he was beaten to the ball by Lossl's sliding save, but Austin poked a foot out and kicked the Dane in the face, drawing blood from a wound on the nose and causing a lengthy stoppage.\nLossl had the ball in his grasp at the time but referee Lee Probert took no action.\nIf he did not spot the incident the Football Association is likely to look at it again and may issue a suspension.\nAustin, though, may be forced out for the next few games anyway after sustaining what looked like a hamstring injury following a strike from the edge of the box which was pushed out by Lossl.\nPellegrino added: \"We will analyse in the next few days. It is not good for Charlie and we lose our top scorer and an important player.\"\nVan Dijk on way out?\nDutch defender Virgil van Dijk was left out of the starting line-up for the second successive game. In fact, he was not even on the bench for this encounter.\nThe centre-back had requested a transfer in the summer and, with the January transfer window just around the corner, clubs including Liverpool and Manchester City have again been linked with a move for the 26-year-old.\n\"There is a lot of speculation about him,\" said Pellegrino. \"I cannot control this but I have to think about the next game. We train tomorrow and then decide if he can play.\"\nCompatriot Wesley Hoedt showed he is capable of stepping in to replace the former Celtic defender, making 10 clearances in the match, more than any other player.\nAt the other end, Dusan Tadic forced Lossl into a fine block from close range, while James Ward-Prowse's well-struck shot was palmed away by the visiting goalkeeper.\nDogged display from Terriers\nAfter a tricky period during which they lost eight games in 13, Huddersfield have now been beaten just once in their past four games.\nThe Terriers are sitting comfortably in 11th place, six points above the relegation zone in their maiden season in the Premier League.\nWagner's men could easily have wilted when they fell behind in the first half, but showed spirit to get back into the contest through Depoitre's fifth goal of the campaign.\nTown captain Christopher Schindler missed two headers from promising positions in the first half, having one effort brilliantly tipped on to the crossbar by keeper Fraser Forster and nodding wide from an unmarked position.\nThey could have grabbed a second, but left-back Scott Malone shot straight at Forster and Aaron Mooy's low drive was brilliantly blocked by Matt Targett.\nWagner said: \"It was a great football match, a lot of opportunities for both sides. I am very happy with the effort, the attitude and the character the players showed as well their quality.\"\nMan of the match - Jonas Lossl (Huddersfield)\nLossl made a total of five saves to keep his side in the match and the sweeper-keeper took the pressure off his defenders by decisively coming off his line to punt the ball to safety.\nWhat next?\nA quick turnaround for both sides means they are back in action in three days' time, with Southampton travelling to Tottenham (kick-off 12:30 GMT) and Huddersfield hosting Stoke (15:00).\nBogeyman Austin - the stats\nSouthampton have won just one of their past 10 Premier League games (drawn four, lost five) and are winless in their past six (drawn three, lost three).\nHuddersfield have picked up four points from their past two away games in the Premier League, as many as they collected in their first eight in the competition.\nAustin has had a hand in seven goals in eight previous league appearances against Huddersfield (five goals, two assists).\nAustin has scored five goals in his past five Premier League starts for Southampton.\nDepoitre has scored three goals in his past three Premier League games, more than in his previous 13 combined (two).\nDepoitre has scored five goals from just eight shots on target in the Premier League.\nSouthampton have lost just one of their past 27 home Premier League games against newly promoted sides (won 17, drawn nine)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-3 Newcastle United\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez hopes his side can kick on after a thrilling 3-2 victory at West Ham ended a run of nine Premier League games without a win.\nThe result moved the Spaniard's side out of the relegation zone after they had slipped from sixth in October to 18th.\n\"It's difficult when you have a bad run,\" said the former Liverpool manager. \"What was really important was to win, and to have a good performance against a good team.\n\"It is important not to be in the bottom three at any time, not just at Christmas.\"\nIn an eventful match at London Stadium, Senegalese midfielder Henri Saivet played a big role in two goals inside the first 10 minutes.\nFirst, his loose pass was picked up by Hammers forward Marko Arnautovic, who raced into the area before slotting past Rob Elliot.\nThat lead lasted only four minutes as Saivet - making his first league start under Benitez - atoned for his error with a 25-yard free-kick that sneaked inside Adrian's near post.\nThe visitors hit the woodwork twice before they went in front, when Mo Diame fired in from Christian Atsu's pass.\nBut they almost ceded their lead immediately - the Hammers winning a penalty when Michail Antonio was brought down by Ciaran Clark, only for Elliot to save Andre Ayew's low effort.\nAtsu soon made it 3-1 with a poked finish after a swift break, but David Moyes' side gave themselves more than a fighting chance when Ayew smashed home after Andy Carroll's header was parried.\nNewcastle survived a frantic closing spell to secure a victory that brought relief for the travelling fans.\nRelive the action from London Stadium\nMagpies finally get their reward\nBenitez has not had the demeanour of a manager under pressure but, after a woeful run, he might have thought it was history repeating having gone down with Newcastle only two seasons ago.\nHis side are not out of danger, with a home fixture against runaway leaders Manchester City on 27 December followed by another against miserly Brighton, but this win will have given them renewed hope.\nThe Spaniard has reminded the media that Newcastle have been playing well recently and have just been unlucky. The fortune turned at London Stadium.\nBenitez made five changes to the starting line-up, including bringing in Saivet and Diame. Bar the early mistake from Saivet, the core of the midfield looked solid against a team missing the injured Mark Noble.\nIt was on the wings that Newcastle had the most joy, though, with the recalled Matt Ritchie and DeAndre Yedlin a constant thorn on the right, and Atsu producing an assist and a goal from the other side.\nMore performances like this could make their recent heartaches a distant memory.\nEnd of the revival?\nAs for the Hammers, had Ayew scored his penalty, things could have ended differently. The Ghana midfielder appeared to lack conviction when he struck the ball as Elliot guessed the right way.\nOne player who had plenty of conviction was ex-Newcastle striker Andy Carroll. After coming on as a substitute the 6ft 4in forward dragged two defenders everywhere he went, but not even that could prevent him from getting on the end of a corner which resulted in Ayew pulling it back to 3-2.\nHowever, that was one of only a few good deliveries that reached the Geordie as West Ham opted to launch the ball up to striker as the clock ticked down.\nMoyes' side slip to 17th, a point above the relegation zone, after their first defeat in four. Is the revival over?\nMan of the match - Christian Atsu (Newcastle)\n'We have conceded a farcical third goal' - reaction\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a game full of errors, we had them the whole game.\n\"We could not pull it together at all. We were huffing and puffing, but could not pull together anything of note though the whole game.\n\"We did not pass well enough out from the back when we had the chance to and, when you are in the position we are in, you cannot afford to miss penalties. We have done that twice since I have been here.\n\"And then we have conceded a farcical third goal. It was glaringly obvious we missed Manuel Lanzini.\n\"Whatever the result is at this time of year, the turnaround is such that you have to roll on to the next game.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We needed a performance and a victory like this. We were pushing really hard against Everton and hit the post twice. I am really pleased for the lads and the fans. It is fantastic.\n\"We had to suffer all the way to the end. We have been playing quite well some games, losing out to a single mistake, so it was tense at the end.\n\"We know it will be difficult to the end but we know that we can win and achieve things doing things as we are.\"\nWest Ham off the spot - the stats\nNewcastle earned their first win in 10 Premier League games (W1 D1 L8), and first away league win since September (1-0 v Swansea).\nWest Ham have lost two successive home Premier League matches against newly promoted sides for the first time since 2006-07.\nThis is the fourth time Newcastle have won both Premier League games against West Ham in a season - on three of those occasions they have been a newly promoted side (1993-94, 2010-11 and 2017-18).\nSaivet became the 16th player to score a direct free-kick in the Premier League for Newcastle - only Everton and West Ham (17 each) have had more.\nEight players have scored their first Premier League goal for Newcastle this season - four of these have done so against West Ham (Diame and Saivet, Clark and Joselu in August).\nWest Ham have failed to score three of their past five Premier League penalties, with each missed by a different player (Mark Noble v Burnley, Manuel Lanzini vs Everton and Ayew).\nAyew scored his 12th goal for West Ham in all competitions since he signed, but this was only his third at the London Stadium.\nAtsu both scored and assisted a goal in the same match for the first time in his English league career.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle host Manchester City on 27 December (19:45 GMT), a day after West Ham visit Bournemouth (15:00 GMT)."

If they are not happy with me, that is not a problem - the most important thing is that they respect each other.\n\"I respect a lot about Sergio, about all he has done, what he has done and what he will do in the future.\n\"He is a legend and he will decide absolutely everything about his life and his future, and I am delighted to have him here with Gabriel and all of the squad.\"\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nCity march on, Cherries keep sliding\nThe Cherries had frustrated City until Asmir Begovic's poor clearance led to Fernandinho finding Aguero to nod the home side in front.\nRaheem Sterling made it 2-0 at the start of the second half when Aguero deftly flicked the ball over the visitors' defence for him to gallop in and slot home.\nAguero added a third with another header, this time from a Silva cross, for City's 100th league goal of 2017.\nDanilo completed the rout with five minutes to go when he ran on to Sterling's pass to score his first goal for the club.\nCity's victory extended their lead at the top of the table to 14 points, reduced to 13 after Manchester United's draw at Leicester later on Saturday. Even so, the 13-point margin at Christmas between first and second is an English top-flight record.\nBournemouth, who are now without a win in their past seven league games, slip into the bottom three.\nEddie Howe's side were the opposition when City began their winning run back in August - on a sunny day on the south coast, when it took a 97th-minute Sterling goal to defeat them.\nNow, 119 days on and with Santa hats in the stands at Etihad Stadium, there is still no stopping Guardiola's side.\nThey have reached the halfway stage of the season and have dropped only two points, while the teams below them continue to falter.\nAguero back to his best\nWith more speculation over his future at the club in the morning papers, this was a timely return to form by Aguero, who produced a brilliant centre-forward's display.\nIf it is true the Argentina striker feels he is under-appreciated by his manager and under-used in his side's biggest games, then this match was a reminder of his talents and also of how much he is admired by City fans.\nThey sang his name throughout, even before he had given his side the lead with his 100th goal at Etihad Stadium and his 183rd for the club he joined in 2011.\nHis best moment came with the goal he made, however, which was courtesy of a delicate dink over a static Cherries defence, that made it easy for Sterling to score.\nAguero's second of the game was another predatory finish, and he could have had another before the end when he ran into the area.\nFor once, he made the wrong decision in front of goal - turning inside, and into a tackle, rather than going for his hat-trick - but otherwise he hardly put a foot wrong.\nBournemouth facing a battle against the drop\nOn the back of a lengthening injury list, his side's slump in form and their slide down the table, a visit to Etihad Stadium would have been the last thing on Howe's Christmas list.\nSeeing Junior Stanislas limp off after only 10 minutes was not the start to the game Howe was looking for either, but his side did manage to keep City quiet for almost half an hour.\nThe Cherries showed the kind of defensive resolve they are going to need in their fight against relegation, but they were unable to offer much of a threat at the other end, managing only one shot on target.\nWith only 15 goals scored in their first 19 league matches, Bournemouth's attack appears the most obvious area that needs strengthening in January - but it is not the only one.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\n'We have to learn, to improve' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We have to learn, to improve, and attack this kind of defence and I think that is going to happen - our target is what we do to find a solution.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a tough game against a very good team. It was always going to be difficult to cope with them.\n\"The first goal was our own doing and changes the game. We made a couple of bad decisions, put ourselves under pressure and they have the players to hurt you.\n\"Every game is important, but the next three take on huge importance for us. We have so many injuries and it's not ideal at this time of year.\"\nMan City hit a century - the stats\nManchester City are the first English top-flight team to score 100 goals in a calendar year since Liverpool in 1982 (106).\nBournemouth have failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since January 2016.\nCity's winning run of 17 games is one more victory than Bournemouth have picked up in total in the Premier League since the start of last season.\nBournemouth have shipped eight goals in their past two top-flight games, as many as in their previous nine in the competition.\nSergio Aguero scored two headed goals in a game for the first time in Europe's big five leagues.\nRaheem Sterling has scored in all five of his Premier League games against Bournemouth, netting seven goals in total.\nSterling has been directly involved in 16 league goals this season (12 goals, four assists), his best return in a single Premier League campaign.\nWhat's next?\nCity's festive schedule brings them trips to Newcastle (19:45 GMT) on Wednesday, 27 December and Crystal Palace (12:00) on New Year's Eve, and concludes with a home game against Watford on 2 January (20:00).\nBournemouth have home games against West Ham (15:00) on 26 December and Everton (15:00) on Saturday, 30 December, before they begin 2018 with a 96-mile hop along the south coast to play Brighton on New Year's Day (12:30)."

They are top drawer.\"\nRelive Stoke's victory over West Brom\nHughes still retains support\nThis match assumed 'must-win' status for Hughes after the toxic atmosphere at the end of the 3-0 home defeat by West Ham United, and despite his insistence that he retained the support of chairman Peter Coates and the club's board.\nHughes was able to acknowledge warm applause as he made his way down one side of the stadium to his seat in the technical area before kick-off - although dissent was seen in the form of a single 'Hughes Out' banner in the stand opposite.\nStoke's fans were warmed by an impressive first 30 minutes that brought the reward of Allen's goal, swept in from a Peter Crouch shot that conveniently turned into the perfect cross.\nChoupo-Moting's composed second goal should have served to settle matters on the pitch, in the stadium and on the touchline but the second half turned into a battle against nerves as Rondon's strike gave West Brom renewed optimism and chipped away at Stoke's fragile confidence.\nTheir survival in the face of West Brom's improvement in the second half was crucial to Hughes' immediate future and they managed to get over the line.\nThere was a frenzied final few minutes as Stoke's goal led a charmed life but there can be no complaints about the level of support for Hughes and his team as the home fans roared them on.\nIt was not pretty but it did not have to be. This was about the three points for team and manager and in the end it was job done.\nMisery piles up for Pardew and Baggies\nAlan Pardew's winless streak of five games since succeeding Tony Pulis as manager pales alongside West Brom's current club record sequence of 18 games without a victory - but this was still an afternoon of bitter frustration.\nThe Baggies had their chances before Choupo-Moting's counter-punch right on half-time, and had enough possession and half-chances to rescue a point once Rondon put them back in the game.\nIn an astonishing final sequence, goalkeeper Jack Butland saved on the line from his own defender Tom Edwards, who had been excellent on his Premier League debut, and Stoke broke away to apply the finishing touch.\nIn the end, however, not helped by substitute Nacer Chadli's swift withdrawal with injury after being sent on as a half-time substitute, Pardew's major problem is that he has inherited a goal-shy side low on self-belief.\nWest Brom, in the second half at least, showed there are some promising signs but it will take even a character as self-confident as Pardew time to start the reconstruction.\n\"The first two goals are errors on our part and that's unusual since I've been here, we've been pretty sound defensively,\" he said.\n\"This team has gone a long time without winning so all credit to them for the way they played in the second half.\n\"Not only did they show the commitment and desire that you'd want as a manager, or a fan, they showed great quality, and with a little bit of luck we could have got an equaliser. We at least deserved that.\"\nMan of the match - Tom Edwards (Stoke City)\nAn enjoyable occasion for Allen - the best of the stats\nWest Brom are the first Premier League team to go 17+ games without a win since Aston Villa (19) in January 2016.\nThis is the Baggies' longest ever winless run in league competition (D8 L9).\nStoke bagged three goals in a Premier League game for the first time since beating Hull 3-1 in April.\nAllen scored his first Premier League goal in 30 appearances, last netting against Crystal Palace in February.\nAllen scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career.\nChoupo-Moting also both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time.\nRond\u00f3n has scored in all three of his Premier League away games against Stoke City.\nChris Brunt provided his 45th assist in the Premier League for West Brom, 21 more than any other Baggies player in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nStoke are at Huddersfield Town on 26 December in a 15:00 GMT kick-off. West Brom take on Everton in the first or two successive home games at The Hawthorns. They also kick-off at 15:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-1 Crystal Palace\nManagerless Swansea City remained bottom of the Premier League despite salvaging a point against a resurgent Crystal Palace thanks to a spectacular equaliser from substitute Jordan Ayew.\nAyew struck with a vicious swerving effort from 20 yards to give Swansea just an eighth point from 10 home Premier League games this season, leaving them four points adrift of safety.\nUnder the guidance of temporary player-manager Leon Britton after Paul Clement was sacked, the hosts seemed energised but failed to trouble their opponents in a goalless first half.\nPalace posed a threat on the break and, after Ruben Loftus-Cheek was brought down by Federico Fernandez, Luka Milivojevic stroked his penalty down the middle to give Roy Hodgson's men the lead.\nBut Ayew's goal gave Swansea a point as their search for a new manager continues, with former Palace manager Frank de Boer and ex-West Ham boss Slaven Bilic among those under consideration.\nFor Palace, the draw extended their club record unbeaten run in the Premier League to eight games but they slipped to 16th in the table.\nBritton in at the deep end\nBeing placed in temporary charge of the Premier League's bottom side was an onerous first managerial job for Britton, a modern-day Swansea great with more than 500 appearances to his name since first playing for them in December 2002.\nThe diminutive midfielder played in every division as the Swans rose from the fourth tier of English football to the top flight, though the 35-year-old admits they have lost their way of late - perennially flirting with relegation, beset with off-field issues, and no longer playing with the attractive style which was once a hallmark.\nSwansea's struggles have made for a toxic atmosphere at the Liberty Stadium for much of the past two years, but Britton's presence in the dugout was a unifying force against Palace as the home crowd roared his name.\nThe Swans played with a higher tempo than they had done in recent weeks, but for much of the game did not look like adding to their dismal tally of 12 goals from 18 Premier League games.\nIn fairness to Clement, the Welsh club's poor form this season was by no means solely his fault, and arguably more a result of their dire recruitment as they failed to adequately replace their two best players - Gylfi Sigurdsson and Fernando Llorente - who left at the start of the season.\nTammy Abraham, the England striker on loan from Chelsea, struggled to impose himself on the game and was not offered the necessary support from his midfielders.\nBut, just as it seemed Swansea were running out of ideas, the industrious Ayew stepped off the bench to provide the game's best moment with a powerful strike which flew past Julian Speroni.\nPalace's revival continues - just\nWhile Swansea had a coaching debutant on the touchline, Palace were hoping to continue their revival under a 70-year-old veteran in Roy Hodgson, who had started his managerial career before Britton was born.\nTheir longest sequence of Premier League matches without defeat owed much to a new-found defensive solidity - which was on display for long spells again here - and the pace and attacking threat players such as Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend offer on the break.\nThe latter was close to scoring a fine opening goal when his curling effort from the edge of the area was excellently tipped over by a stretching Lukasz Fabianski, while Loftus-Cheek went close with a swerving shot of his own.\nPalace's ventures into the Swansea box were more sporadic after the interval but they made one such visit count when the agile Loftus-Cheek drew a clumsy challenge from Fernandez.\nAfter having penalty-taking duties snatched from him by Christian Benteke - who then missed - in the draw with Bournemouth earlier this month, Milivojevic struck his spot-kick confidently beyond Fabianski.\nThe Eagles looked comfortable at this point and, although their unbeaten run is intact, Hodgson will be annoyed his side surrendered the opportunity to claim a fifth win of his reign as they sat back and invited late pressure.\nMan of the match - Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Crystal Palace)\n'The players gave me everything' - what they said\nSwansea caretaker manager Leon Britton: \"I'm very proud of that performance. If any team was to get a winner it was us and the players have given me everything they had.\n\"We needed fresh legs to give us a spark and Jordan came on and got the goal and was lively. Obviously he'll be disappointed not to start but you can see Jordan has the right attitude\n\"The fans are great with me, I'm always appreciative of that. Nothing has changed and I'm delighted we have the point but I'm not interested in the job full-time\n\"It's day by day and as soon as something changes they'll let me know.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"I think we looked quite dangerous on the counter and our defence was solid throughout - we really restricted their chances to a minimum so it wasn't a surprise when we went in front but they scored a very good goal. It's another point in our fight out of the relegation zone so we're not too unhappy.\n\"I think when they see the video they'll agree it was a penalty. As far as I'm concerned the referee has given it and you get on with it\n\"It's been going well with Benteke and Wilfried the past few games, and he gives us a focal figure in our attack. It's a different style to when Wilf and Andros play together but all things considered a point away from home is another step in our building exercise.\n\"We've got to build our house brick by brick.\"\nPalace go unbeaten in eight - the stats\nCrystal Palace are now unbeaten in eight Premier League games - their longest run in the top flight since October 1990 (a run of 12).\nOnly Manchester City (27) and Liverpool (10) are on longer unbeaten runs in the Premier League than the Eagles.\nAyew scored his first goal in 16 Premier League games, since netting Swansea's second in their 2-0 win at Crystal Palace in the reverse fixture in August.\nNo player has scored more penalties in the Premier League this season than Milivojevic (three, level with Sergio Aguero and Wayne Rooney).\nDespite earning a point, Swansea will be bottom of the table on Christmas Day - only three clubs have ever survived relegation from the Premier League despite being bottom at Christmas (West Brom 2004-05, Sunderland 2013-14 and Leicester 2014-15).\nSwansea have had two or fewer shots on target in 10 of their 19 Premier League games this season.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea City head for Anfield to face Liverpool on 26 December (17:30 GMT), while Crystal Palace host Arsenal on 28 December (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Harry Kane transforms Tottenham from 'good to really good' side, says Sean Dyche\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said Harry Kane transforms Tottenham from a \"good to a really good side\" after the striker equalled Alan Shearer's record for most Premier League goals scored in a calendar year with a hat-trick in a 3-0 victory at Turf Moor.\nEngland international Kane netted his 34th, 35th and 36th league goals of 2017 to equal Shearer's 1995 mark as Spurs moved up to fifth in the table\n\"He is one of the best forwards in Europe,\" said Dyche.\n\"He was by far the best player on the pitch and that was one of the best performances I have seen this season.\"\nKane is now the joint top scorer in the Premier League this season with 15 goals from 19 games.\nDyche believes it is the 24-year-old's willingness to do \"the ugly stuff\" that sets him apart from other strikers.\n\"There are a lot of top players who can finish,\" Dyche added. \"He works. He is awkward. You can't get a clean header against him. He is an absolutely top-class player.\n\"If you have a figurehead like that, every time the ball is turned over, he is on it like a shot. He can smell a chance as quick as any centre-forward I have seen.\"\nKane has one more chance to break Shearer's record, with Tottenham at home to out-of-form Southampton on 26 December.\nAnd Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino believes Kane has the ability to become an even better player than he already is.\n\"He can still improve,\" he said. \"Players arrive at their best at 27, 28, 29.\n\"It all depends how professional you are. If he keeps working hard every day in training and never changes that mentality, he can play until he wants.\n\"For me, he can still improve his game.\"\nKane broke the deadlock at Turf Moor in the sixth minute, scoring from the spot after Spurs were awarded a controversial penalty when Kevin Long was adjudged to have fouled Dele Alli.\nKane made it 2-0 midway through the second half, racing on to Moussa Sissoko's pass before sliding the ball past Burnley keeper Nick Pope.\nHe completed his hat-trick late on, tucking in a clinical finish at the far post.\nThe win moves Spurs to within a point of fourth-placed Liverpool, while Burnley drop to seventh.\nRelive Tottenham's win at Burnley\nKane's stunning year continues\nWhatever happens on Boxing Day, Kane can look back on 2017 as an incredible goalscoring year.\nThe Spurs frontman has scored 36 goals in 35 Premier League matches to equal the record Shearer set in 1995. Only two players have come close to matching that feat - Robin van Persie in 2011 and Thierry Henry in 2004.\nAnd Kane could even finish the year as the top scorer in Europe's top five leagues.\nHe has netted 53 goals for club and country in 2017, as many as Edinson Cavani (PSG), Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid), and only one behind Lionel Messi (Barcelona).\nKane is the only one of the quintet who could play again this year - and he could easily have had more goals at Turf Moor, missing a couple of chances that by his standards were routine, notably putting a shot from close range into the side-netting.\nAlli at the centre of controversy\nBurnley fans will feel aggrieved with Alli's contribution to Tottenham's win.\nThere appeared to be little contact when he fell inside the box as he and Long went for the ball, and he was arguably fortunate to have been on the pitch at that point anyway.\nJust four minutes into the game, Alli - criticised for a nasty tackle on Kevin de Bruyne in last week's 4-1 defeat by Manchester City - slid in rashly on Charlie Taylor.\nBut referee Michael Oliver was satisfied it was only a bookable offence - and Alli went on to provide the assist for Kane's third goal.\n\"It's a real tough one,\" said Dyche.\n\"He's out of control, he's never going to get the ball. By the modern rules, he got lucky with it.\n\"It's the old favourite - an orange card.\"\nEarly strike puts paid to Burnley's plan\nSuch has been Burnley's incredible form this season, they started the game above Tottenham and could have gone fifth with a victory.\nMost of the Clarets' nine Premier League wins this term have been built on the foundation of defending in numbers, not giving up the first goal and getting ahead so their opponents have to chase the game.\nTottenham's early penalty threw that tactic into disarray.\nSean Dyche has found the answers to many questions since Burnley's promotion, but they have won none of the 46 Premier League games under him in which they have conceded the first goal.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane\nKane becomes Tottenham's first - the stats\nBurnley conceded as many goals in this game as they had in their previous nine at Turf Moor combined this season.\nSpurs are the first visiting team to score three or more in a Premier League game at Turf Moor since Crystal Palace in January 2015 (3-2).\nThis was only Burnley's second Premier League home defeat in the month of December (P12 W6 D4 L2) - the other coming against Liverpool on 26 December in 2014.\nKane has scored 93 goals in the Premier League - second only to Teddy Sheringham (97) for goals in the competition for Spurs.\nThe England striker is also the first Tottenham player to score 50 goals away from home in the Premier League.\nKane has scored 50 Premier League away goals in just 67 games; at least 18 games faster than any other player in the competition's history (Sergio Aguero 85).\nAlli provided a Premier League assist to Kane for the 13th time - only one player has assisted another more often for Tottenham in Premier League history (Darren Anderton to Sheringham, 20).\nWhat next?\nIt does not get any easier for Burnley as they travel to Manchester United on 26 December (15:00 GMT). Tottenham, meanwhile host Southampton on the same day at 12:30 GMT."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-2 Manchester United\nJose Mourinho criticised Manchester United's \"childish\" errors as his team fell further behind leaders Manchester City after conceding a 94th-minute equaliser from Harry Maguire at 10-man Leicester.\nThe Portuguese felt his side missed \"joke chances\" as they fell 13 points behind City - the biggest points gap between first and second place at Christmas in English top-flight history.\nIt was the second time in a week that United have conceded a goal in injury time, losing 2-1 to Championship side Bristol City in the EFL Cup quarter-finals.\nUnited had looked set to take all three points after Juan Mata's double had seen them recover from Jamie Vardy's opener, while Foxes substitute Daniel Amartey was sent off for the home side 16 minutes and nine seconds after coming on, following two bookings in four minutes.\nAnthony Martial and Jesse Lingard were particularly guilty of missing golden opportunities in the second half to put the game beyond Leicester.\nMaguire caught the United defence out as they failed to deal with Marc Albrighton's deep cross into the box, the England defender running past the injured Chris Smalling to side-foot the ball past David de Gea from close range.\n\"We were punished by our mistakes,\" Mourinho told Sky Sports. \"Childish loss of possession, so easy. Childish in their box and childish in our box.\n\"Half an hour after our second it is a game to finish four, five, six-one. We didn't win because we missed incredible chances, joke chances.\"\nWasteful United's missed opportunity\nThis result was a huge blow to any hope United had of catching City, who had earlier beaten Bournemouth 4-0.\nAnd former England striker Alan Shearer believes the title race is \"as good as over\".\nSpeaking on Match of the Day he said: \"Manchester City have lost twice in 2017 in the Premier League, they will not lose five games in the second half of the season.\"\nMourinho made eight changes from the side that lost to Bristol City, with Paul Pogba returning from suspension to captain the team, while Victor Lindelof, making his fifth Premier League start, went to right-back in place of the injured Antonio Valencia.\nThe Swede and centre-back Phil Jones were badly exposed by Leicester's counter-attack for the Foxes' opener.\nWilfred Ndidi sprayed a 60-yard pass to Riyad Mahrez, who only had Smalling and De Gea for company.\nThe Algerian held up the ball before sliding a clever pass to the arriving Vardy, who placed a low finish into the bottom corner for his 50th Premier League goal.\nMata equalised on 40 minutes with a precise finish, rolling the ball into the far corner from the middle of the box.\nLindelof blocked Christian Fuchs' goalbound effort after the break, while Martial missed a one-on-one with Kasper Schmeichel, blasting over from 12 yards.\nSpanish midfielder Mata got his second on the hour mark, beating Schmeichel with curling a free-kick after Martial had been fouled on the edge of the box.\nUnited dominated in the second half and the result should never have been in question with 19 attempts on goal in the match.\nLingard should have made it three when he hit the post after rounding Schmeichel, while the Dane also got his fingertips to the ball to stop substitute Marcus Rashford when he was through on goal.\nUnited failed to capitalise on Amartey's 73rd-minute sending off and Mourinho looked to shore up the lead instead of extending it, bringing on Ander Herrera for Lingard with 15 minutes left in the match.\n\"I don't get United,\" said ex-England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live. \"They've had so many chances to really put this game beyond Leicester but they've messed about and missed chances.\"\n'Good result for the future'\nLeicester had also suffered EFL Cup defeat in midweek, losing on penalties to Manchester City.\nClaude Puel made seven changes, with Mahrez and Vardy restored to the starting line-up.\nThe pair were crucial to the Foxes' gameplan and, after soaking up United's pressure, they counter-attacked at will.\nAfter United took the lead they were fortunate not to fall further behind, but showed character to come back and equalise.\n\"It was difficult but with our positive attitude we stayed in the game and believed in ourselves,\" Puel told Match of the Day.\n\"It's a good result for all of us because the belief keeps going. It's fantastic for the future.\n\"Now we know if that situation happens again we can score with 10 men against 11, so that's a good feeling for the future.\"\nTheir revival under Puel leaves them in eighth at Christmas, but with only two defeats in his 10 league games in charge.\nMan of the match - Juan Mata\nStats - Vardy's milestone\nVardy scored his 50th Premier League goal in this match - the first player to score 50 in the competition for Leicester City.\n42% (21) of Jamie Vardy's 50 Premier League goals have come against 'big six opposition'.\nSince August 2014, only Sergio Aguero (21 in 30 appearances) has scored as many goals in the Premier League against fellow 'big six' opposition as Vardy (21 goals in 40 appearances).\nMata has been involved in five goals in his last four Premier League appearances against Leicester City (four goals, one assist).\nThree of the nine Premier League goals scored from direct free-kicks this season have been netted against Kasper Schmeichel.\nAmartey's dismissal was the quickest a substitute has been sent off in the Premier League since Ben Watson for Watford at Southampton in August 2016 (12 minutes, eight seconds).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United host Burnley at 15:00 GMT on 26 December, while Leicester play at Watford at the same time."

He is Europe's top scorer over the past 12 months in the five major countries (England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France)\nThe Spurs striker has now scored 96 Premier League goals for the club - one off Teddy Sheringham's record\nMore trouble ahead for Saints\nSouthampton had drawn three and lost three of their past six games and arrived at Wembley without two key players in Austin, who is injured and suspended, and Virgil van Dijk, who was left out of the squad again amid reports of a January exit.\nThey looked overwhelmed at times and contributed to Tottenham's dominance.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg fouled Danny Rose on the edge of the area and gave away the Christian Eriksen free-kick which led to Kane's opener.\nAnd Nathan Redmond's mistake in the Spurs half gifted the hosts possession and their counter-attack finished with Son's strike for 4-0.\nSouthampton, three points above the relegation zone in 13th, were able to recover some pride as they twice beat a stuttering Lloris, but it was too little, too late.\nMauricio Pellegrino's side face more tough tasks ahead, with an away trip to Manchester United up next.\n\"We were a little bit unlucky because in the second half we were close to going 1-2 but once we conceded the third one the game was gone,\" said Pellegrino.\n\"I want to see a team with character fighting and playing for the ball. Sometimes you do well, sometimes you do not but the minimum is to show this from the beginning. The wrong thing is we waited until the Tottenham goal to react.\"\nOn Van Dijk's omission, the Southampton boss added: \"We know that around Virgil there will be a lot of speculation.

No critics to my players.\"\nUnited lacking up front\nRomelu Lukaku and Zlatan Ibrahimovic started up front together for the first time, but their partnership only lasted for 45 minutes before Mourinho decided he needed something different up front.\nIt was Ibrahimovic's first Premier League start of the season and, although he scored his first goal of the campaign in last week's Carabao Cup defeat by Bristol City, he looks well short of his best form after returning from a serious knee ligament injury.\nThe 36-year-old also lacks pace, something that Lingard injected into the United attack when he was brought on at half-time.\nLukaku's performance was just as underwhelming, however. He managed only effort at goal - a header from near the penalty spot that ended up a long way off target.\nThe Belgian was kept quiet by the Burnley defence throughout and, if not for Lingard's two moments of magic, the result would have been even more damaging for United.\nLingard scored twice but would have been off the mark earlier if not for a wonderful save from Nick Pope, who denied him from point-blank range before the ball bounced to safety off the crossbar.\nBurnley almost hang on for victory\nBurnley came within minutes of their first win at Old Trafford since 1962, but still left with a point and immense credit.\nThis was a backs-against-the-wall performance that at times was reminiscent of the 0-0 draw they earned in the same fixture last season, when United had 37 shots without scoring.\nUnited had 23 this time, which represents progress of sorts for the Clarets, but determined defending and some superb saves from Nick Pope were not the only reason they earned another draw.\nDefour's free-kick was a sublime strike that left David de Gea clutching at thin air as he tried in vain to keep it out, and a reminder of the quality that has taken Sean Dyche's side to seventh place in the table.\n\"Overall, to come here and get a point is very pleasing, especially when the squad is stretched,\" Dyche said afterwards. \"It's a very tough place to come.\n\"United have only lost to Manchester City and not dropped another point, but we made a great start and got in among them.\n\"I'm really pleased. The good thing is the mentality we showed coming off a tough one [Saturday's defeat by Tottenham] the other day. Sometimes fear can creep into players but it wasn't there.\n\"There was a nice assuredness about the way we went about it.\"\nMan of the match - Burnley's Ben Mee\nMourinho manages a rare comeback\nThis was the 20th time a Jose Mourinho managed side had been two-goals down in a Premier League game, but only the second time they hadn't lost (W0 D2 L18).\nThe Clarets became just the second team to score twice against Jose Mourinho's Man Utd at Old Trafford, after Man City (twice, in September 2016 and earlier this month).\nJesse Lingard has had a hand in 10 Premier League goals this season (6 goals, 4 assists in 16 apps) - as many as in his previous three seasons combined (5 goals, 3 assists in 51 games).\nLingard also became the first Man Utd player to score a brace as a substitute since Chris Smalling in February 2015 - also against Burnley.\nManchester United have had 61 shots across their last two home games against Burnley, but have scored just two goals and picked up two points.\nMan Utd have scored nine goals via substitutes in the Premier League this season, more than any other side in the competition.\nWhat next?\nUnited end the year with a home game against Southampton on Saturday (17:30 GMT KO) and start 2018 by travelling to play Everton on New Year's Day (17:30 GMT).\nBurnley travel to play cross-Pennine rivals Huddersfield on Saturday (15:00 GMT KO), followed by a home game against Liverpool (15:00) on 1 January."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 3-3 West Ham United\nWest Ham manager David Moyes described the controversial late equaliser that denied his side a rare win as \"a killer\" after Bournemouth salvaged a point at the Vitality Stadium.\nCherries forward Callum Wilson diverted a Nathan Ake header in - but the goal was initially disallowed for offside before referee Bobby Madley gave it.\nWest Ham were incensed by the decision, feeling not only that Wilson had been in an offside position when Ake's header skimmed across the goal, but also that his vital touch was handball.\n\"I think he said the assistant referee only put his flag up to draw attention to it, and I've never heard of that ever,\" said Moyes.\n\"To lose a goal like that is a killer - it's hard to take.\"\nWilson's goal gave a hugely entertaining game an astonishing climax, following two Marko Arnautovic goals inside the last 10 minutes that had seen West Ham retake the lead.\nJames Collins had put the Hammers ahead early in the first half, before Dan Gosling levelled before the break. Ake then struck in the second half, only for Arnautovic to put the Hammers within reach of a fifth league win of the season.\nMoyes added: \"If the assistant referee raises his flag, what would it be for? Offside? Arguably you could say that it was offside, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. But I can't give them any benefit of the doubt for their player raising his hand.\"\n\"It looks like we might have got away with one there,\" said Cherries boss Eddie Howe. \"But I thought a draw was the least we deserved. I know it's difficult for West Ham to take.\"\nThe home side had 26 attempts on goal, but the result means Bournemouth remain third from bottom, a point and a place below West Ham.\nOnly a few minutes before Wilson struck, West Ham had enjoyed a slice of luck when Asmir Begovic slipped while trying to clear in the soaking conditions, allowing Arnautovic to slide the ball home to make it 2-2.\nAnd just before the end of the 90 minutes, Begovic's block to deny Javier Hernandez at close range landed perfectly for Arnautovic to score what David Moyes' side must have thought was the winner.\nAnalysis - wrong decision?\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day\nThe referee got it wrong, basically. Callum Wilson is a tiny bit offside and Bobby Madley has overruled his linesman for some reason.\nWe assume he thinks he didn't touch it. I can understand why David Moyes is fuming, but Bournemouth did make the better chances.\nBournemouth show some spirit\nThe Cherries had not scored in their last four league outings, and Jermain Defoe's absence for up to two months with a fractured ankle meant that manager Eddie Howe had much to worry about with his side's attacking threat.\nAnd Joshua King's missed chances from inside the area in the first half would have dismayed the Cherries boss, with such fine margins between his side and the rest at the foot of the table.\nBut Howe's team do not lack spirit, and they largely stuck to the attractive style of play that has marked their two-and-a-half seasons in the Premier League. often looking to play their way out from defence.\nThey fought back well after the defence allowed Collins to get his head to Aaron Cresswell's corner, while the slippery conditions contributed to the goals that saw their lead disappear.\nThey will need to show the same kind of battling qualities in their remaining 18 league games if they are to make it to a fourth season in the top flight.\nNo big turnaround for Hammers\nThe dramatic finale means that West Ham are only one place higher than they were when Moyes was appointed as manager on 7 November.\nAlthough there have been promising signs at times, the Scot's arrival has not resulted in a decisive move up the table like the one overseen at his old club Everton by ex-Hammers boss Sam Allardyce.\nJust fleetingly, they looked like they had earned victory the hard way, with Arnautovic pouncing to grab his third and fourth goals in three games.\nBut the controversy in stoppage time leaves Moyes and his side still mired in a relegation battle as the second half of the season unfolds.\nMan of the match - Nathan Ake (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth's barren run continues - the stats\nBournemouth are now without a victory in eight successive Premier League matches (D4 L4) - equalling their worst run in the competition [occurring three times previously].\nWest Ham have picked up eight points in their past five Premier League games (W2 D2 L1), one more than they managed in their previous 11 in the competition.\nCourtesy of Dan Gosling's strike, Bournemouth scored their first goal in 344 minutes of Premier League action.\nAaron Cresswell has provided three assists in his past six away leagues games, as many as in his previous 44 on the road.\nJosh King has been directly involved in four goals in his past two top-flight games against the Hammers [three goals, one assist].\nNathan Ake scored his first goal in 24 Premier League appearances since netting against Southampton in December 2016.\nMarko Arnautovic has netted five goals in his past five Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 38.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host Everton on Saturday, 30 December at 15:00 GMT, while West Ham have a lengthy wait for their next outing, which is at home to West Brom on Tuesday, 2 January at 19:45. They face Tottenham away just 48 hours later."

We were aggressive and controlled the open play, but they were dangerous from set pieces and scored too.\n\"Maybe 1-1 was a fair result, so we accept it. When you invest so much and create such good situations on the wings, you hope for more clear cut chances. We performed well, though.\n\"It was a very intense game played in a great atmosphere. We have seen that we can more than compete with an established Premier League side like Stoke City\".\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"It was a little bit to and fro and you could argue we had more clear cut chances. We created some good moments. After their goal we kept at it, pushing and asking questions. We showed good desire.\"\nOn his injury problems: \"It is not easy at the moment, but we are getting through it. The lads are giving me everything and getting points.\"\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield welcome Burnley on Saturday, while Stoke travel to Chelsea - both games are at 15:00 GMT.\nStats - Ince's goal drought is over\nOnly Southampton (11) are on a current longer run without a Premier League clean sheet than Stoke (10, level with Newcastle).\nSobhi has scored in consecutive Premier League games, after failing to find the net in his first 29 appearances in the competition.\nInce scored his first Premier League goal for Huddersfield with what was his 45th shot in the competition for them.\nIn fact, this was Ince's second ever goal in the competition. His first came with his first ever shot, for Crystal Palace back in February 2014, with his goal today ending a run of 59 shots without one.\nHuddersfield kept a clean sheet in their first three Premier League games this season, but have managed to keep one in just three of the 17 since."

        "article_text": "Watford 2-1 Leicester City\nWatford boss Marco Silva says he was never worried about their bad form, as they beat Leicester City to end a six-game winless run.\nThe Hornets - who only had one shot on target in their 2-1 win - trailed when Riyad Mahrez headed the Foxes, now without a win in four games themselves, into the lead from Marc Albrighton's cross.\nBut Molla Wague equalised on his first Premier League start, against his former club, from close range and Richarlison then hit the post towards the end of the first half.\nThe Hornets' winner was a Kasper Schmeichel own goal as the keeper, while trying to keep Abdoulaye Doucoure's shot from a tight angle out of his goal, inadvertently turned it past his own line.\nHeurelho Gomes made two excellent late saves to seal the win for Watford, from Wes Morgan's close-range effort and Leonardo Ulloa's header.\nWatford had been only three points off the Champions League spots before a run of one point from six games.\nSilva told BBC Sport: \"We didn't lose our focus when we weren't winning, and now that we have won, I'm not going to be the happiest man in the world.\n\"I know clearly what is our reality as a club. You can have some fantastic results in a row but a season is too long. I know what can happen if you have lots of players banned or injured. It's impossible to win all our matches.\"\nWatford end miserable run\nWatford - without a win in over a month and with just one point from their last six games - looked as if they were going to endure a miserable Boxing Day when they trailed to Mahrez's header.\nBut to their credit, and boss Silva's delight, they showed great character to come back. He had to change his system when winger Roberto Pereyra came off with a knock, and was replaced by striker Stefano Okaka - with Richarlison moving out to the left wing.\nAnd their fortunes changed from that point.\nSome Leicester fans could almost be excused for not remembering Mali defender Wague, who had a one-game loan spell with the club last season. But they will remember him now, as he pounced late in the first half after the Foxes failed to clear a corner.\nThat goal lifted Watford, who had been below-par - or based on recent form, maybe playing at par. And Richarlison smashed the ball off the post two minutes later from Tom Cleverley's pass.\nThey continued that momentum into the second half. Cleverley's deep free-kick found Doucoure, who tried to beat Schmeichel at his near post from close to the byline. The ball might have been going across the goal when Schmeichel touched the ball past the line, with Ben Chilwell clearing from just behind the line.\nWatford - who remain 10th - were indebted to their keeper, Gomes, for the win when he denied Morgan and Ulloa late on.\nLeicester form starting to concern?\nStats can be used to prove whatever you want, and had Leicester won, then a 3-0 Crystal Palace defeat, followed by draws in 90 minutes against Manchester City - a penalty shootout defeat in the Carabao Cup - and United in the league, would not have been too troubling.\nBut their defeat by Watford means they have now failed to win in four matches, having lost only one of Claude Puel's first eight games in charge.\nThey deservedly led when Mahrez headed home Albrighton's excellent right-footed cross at the back post.\nThe Foxes should already have led at that stage when Albrighton played Jamie Vardy through on goal but he attempted to clip the ball over Gomes, and it fell wide.\nWatford then scored twice - and hit the post - before Leicester rallied late on, with Morgan forcing a save from Gomes from six yards out and moments later Ulloa, who had just come off the bench, producing another fine stop from the Brazilian.\n'It's a story about free-kicks' - Leicester reaction\nLeicester boss Claude Puel to BBC Sport: \"It was a little difficult playing against a physical team with long balls and second balls. The scoreline at half-time was a little harsh as we didn't concede a lot of chances.\n\"The second half was a bit more difficult. It's a story about free-kicks. We have to correct this situation for the next game. We were a little unlucky at the end as we had some fantastic chances, which Heurelho Gomes saved.\n\"A draw would have been a fair result. It's a big disappointment. We had a positive attitude.\"\nMatch stats - one shot on target, two goals\nLeicester have lost two of their last three in the Premier League, the same total they had lost in the previous 13.\nMahrez has scored in each of his last four Premier League games against Watford, including in all three at Vicarage Road.\nWague's goal means Watford have now had more different goalscorers in the Premier League than any other side this season (13).\nLeicester have only won one of their 12 Premier League games played on Boxing Day (D2 L9), losing each of the last four in a row.\nWatford scored twice despite landing just one shot on target, with the winning goal coming courtesy of Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\nMarc Albrighton has assisted in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since April.\nMan of the match - Molla Wague (Watford)\nWhat's next?\nWatford host Swansea on Saturday (15:00 GMT), with Leicester away at Liverpool at the same time."

This season sometimes we could have more luck.\n\"We have great respect for Manchester City because they are doing an extraordinary thing.\"\nRelive Chelsea's win over Brighton\nMan Utd draw - Saturday's live action\nConte's side looked lacklustre in parts during a first half in which Chris Hughton's solid 4-5-1 formation minimised the threat to two wasted chances from close range by Tiemoue Bakayoko and Victor Moses.\nBut Brighton were caught cold 52 seconds into the second period when Morata ran between defenders to head home Cesar Azpilicueta's fine cross.\nThe goal instantly changed the dynamic, lifting pressure from the home side who had repeatedly turned to the guile of Eden Hazard in attempt to break the visitors down.\nBut it was Alonso who sealed the win, glancing in a header moments after he was denied twice when Mat Ryan saved from a free-kick and a header.\n\"In the second half we settled very well and created many chances,\" added Conte. \"It was a good performance with good intensity.\"\nComfortable Chelsea in hectic period\nChelsea are unbeaten at the Bridge since defeat by Manchester City on 30 September. They continue to give chase with this win, which showcased a gritty persistence in contrast to the free-flowing football which Pep Guardiola's side have served up this season.\nScintillating football was at a minimum until after the opening goal when confidence grew. Cesc Fabregas pulled strings in midfield with 108 passes, a figure matched by Azpilicueta, who has more assists than any defender in the league since the start of last season.\nHazard could have added a third on the break but for a fine goalline clearance from Lewis Dunk as Chelsea saw off a side offering resistance but minimal ambition.\nKey to their success were wing-backs Alonso and Moses playing high up the pitch, while Bakayoko was pushed further forward at the break.\nConte will be thrilled with the simplicity of this win at a time when his side face three league fixtures in nine days.\nThe Blues are seven points worse off than after 20 league games last season but Conte can take comfort from nine wins in 12 league games. Chelsea are showing admirable consistency but City's brilliance looks set to render it meaningless.\nHope for organised Brighton?\nBrighton - 12th in the table - have one win in nine league games and after Tuesday's defeat, Hughton again pointed out the need to strengthen in January.\n\"We need to figure a way of getting the goals we need,\" said Hughton. \"What we will do is work as hard as we can coming up in January to strengthen the squad.\"\nThe Seagulls hope to bring in attacking options to bolster an offensive unit which has managed just 15 league goals.\nThey looked resolute in reducing the home side to just two good openings before the break but never married that solidity with threat.\nThe speedy Jose Izquierdo, deployed on the left flank, remained peripheral with more than half of his 29 touches coming in his own half.\nTheir set-up in recent away fixtures has delivered four straight defeats without registering a goal, as they bid for survival in their first season in the league.\nBut Hughton's side have already amassed 21 points and talk at this time of year sometimes sees fans and managers focus on what is considered a 40-point benchmark for safety. In recent seasons, only Wolverhampton Wanderers have needed that points haul for survival in the 2010-2011 season.\nIn the six seasons since, 37 points on average has kept sides up. Brighton are more than halfway to that figure and their early resilience against a form side should offer plenty of hope they can earn the points needed.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas\nChelsea's Spanish influence - the stats\nNo team in Europe's big five leagues has seen more league goals scored by Spanish players this season than Chelsea (20, level with Real Sociedad).\nBrighton have lost four consecutive away league games without scoring a single goal for the first time since October 2002.\nChelsea have scored 12 headed goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nAlvaro Morata has netted 12 headed goals in the big five European leagues since the start of last season, more than any other player.\nUp next?\nChelsea play Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday (15:00 GMT) at the same time that Brighton host Newcastle."

Despite conjuring 17 attempts on goal, West Brom only hit the target three times. Their 14 goals from 20 matches this season is the league's second-worst return - only Swansea have scored fewer.\nThe Baggies have not won a league match since 19 August - a 1-0 victory at Burnley. It is the worst streak in the division since Aston Villa failed to win in 19 game between August 2015 and January 2016.\nBy contrast, Sam Allardyce's first five games in charge of Everton make for rather different reading; the Toffees are yet to lose under the former England boss, winning three times and drawing three.\nThey were far from their best at the Hawthorns and were lucky to come away with a point - but had Oumar Niasse beaten Ben Foster at his near post in the 89th minute they might have stolen all three.\nNiasse drove low straight into Foster, who also gathered the substitute's follow-up to preserve one point for his beleaguered side.\nBolasie is back\nAmong the three changes made by Allardyce after Saturday's 0-0 draw with Chelsea was a first appearance for Bolasie since the knee injury he suffered on 4 December 2016 - 387 days ago.\nThe DR Congo winger has had two operations since then and finally had the chance to impress on what was just his 16th appearance for the club since a \u00a325m move from Crystal Palace in the summer of 2016.\nEverton's best chance did not come until long after he was replaced - Niasse's late shot - but he was still his side's brightest player in an otherwise dim team performance.\nIn the first half he was energetic, continuously demanding to have the ball as he looked to contribute as much as possible. Allarydce will surely be more than happy to take point - and just as happy about Bolasie surviving the biggest step back to full fitness.\nMan of the match - Chris Brunt\nListen: 'We could go top four finish'\n'Our best 90 minutes' - what the managers said\nWest Brom boss Alan Pardew: \"It is difficult to try understand how we have not won today but we go onto the next game. It was a sound performance and the fans were tremendous.\n\"We have 17 games to go. If we can play at the level we just have I will be very, very happy and we will get enough points. It was probably our best 90 minutes since I've been here.\"\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce: \"Our football was average in possession, which continues to concern me. We are building blocks in terms of being resilient but we need to be better in possession.\n\"We've got another point, another clean sheet and we look forward to our injured and ill players coming back so that, certainly in possession, we can get better.\"\nClean sheets under Allardyce - the stats\nEverton have kept four clean sheets in their six Premier League games under Allardyce - the same number they kept in their previous 23 league games.\nWest Brom midfielder Gareth Barry has played in 18 league matches on Boxing Day - more than any other player in the competition.\nBarry picked up his 122nd yellow card in the Premier League - 22 more than any other player.\nEverton are unbeaten in their past six away games no 26 December in the Premier League (W3 D3).\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom's next match is a 16:30 GMT kick-off at home to Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday.\nEverton next play away at Bournemouth in the league on Saturday, a 15:00 kick-off."

The only problem for Liverpool was it perhaps took slightly longer than it should have done for them to reach their ruthless best.\nSalah, who went into this game having scored 15 goals in his previous 15 matches, was guilty of wasting several good chances before Alexander-Arnold really did open the floodgates with a third goal that left the visitors backtracking and beaten for the rest of the match.\nFirmino was withdrawn in the 68th minute - denied the chance of a likely hat-trick - and his replacement Dominic Solanke might have had a treble of his own, flashing his most impressive effort just wide of the post on the volley.\nHowever, the fact the England Under-20 World Cup winner failed to score his first Liverpool goal was the biggest of small problems for Klopp, who embraced the young forward with an ironic grin as they made their way off the pitch.\nThe nightmare after Christmas\nIt was always going to be a daunting task for Swansea.\nThis was a trip to the one of the league's top-scoring sides and their second of four matches in 10 days. The Welsh club, with just three wins all season, had the odds firmly stacked up in opposition.\nBut until Alexander-Arnold's goal - crafted from sheer desire to beat his man to the ball and profit - the Swans were actually still in it.\nRoque Mesa, Tom Carroll and Leroy Fer had impressed with some attractive interplay, Wayne Routledge was a threat on the wing and in the first half they were averaging about 14% more possession than Anfield's other visitors this season.\nHowever, when Fer played the ball back to his defence without looking and found Salah instead, the game really was up. Firmino added the easy fourth, before slack defending from forward Jordan Ayew allowed Oxlade-Chamberlain a second chance to make it five.\nEven if his influence and potential candidacy will not be judged on this result alone, temporary player-manager Leon Britton will surely be very disappointed his side folded like they did.\nAnalysis\nFormer Chelsea winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live\nLiverpool again played pretty well in the first half. Swansea worked hard but Liverpool stepped up in the second half and were fabulous going forward. They were sparkling in the final third when they were attacking and could have had more goals.\nIt sums it up for Swansea that they had one chance and it was with the last touch of the game. Nothing went right for Swansea and they are in big, big trouble.\nThis Swansea team are not going to stay up unless they acquire players in January. Liverpool, on the other hand, look like they can score against anyone.\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino (Liverpool)\n'A perfect result' - what the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I'm really happy with what we learned from the game. It is a perfect result for us, nobody injured I don't think. Important three points, five goals, clean sheet so it's all good.\n\"I know that people are often not patient enough as it's all about results. It's possible from outside to think it's not quick enough, we feel really good in this moment. Five minutes in the Arsenal game was not good - but the performance was good. We drew. For tonight, we feel really good.\"\nSwansea caretaker boss Leon Britton on BBC Radio 5 live: \"After we conceded the second goal we made so many mistakes, it's unacceptable. It's difficult when the game is going like that, but you have to face up to it and take responsibility.\n\"When I see that second-half performance it hurts an awful lot. It's difficult seeing it after being at the club for so long. After the second goal the heads went down. But you are still professional, you have to keep going, you have to give everything you've got.\"\nOn any update on the next manager: \"I've heard nothing, I've got no update. It's just me until I'm told anything different.\"\nLiverpool's high fives - the stats\nOf teams in the Europe's big five leagues - England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain - only Paris St-Germain (89) and Manchester City (77) have scored more goals this season than Liverpool (75).\nOnly Manchester City in 1995-96 and Derby in 2007-08 scored fewer goals in their first 20 games of a Premier League campaign (10 each) than Swansea have this term (11).\nThis is the fourth time this season that Liverpool have scored five goals or more in a match - and no Premier League team has hit the five-goal mark more often than the Reds in 2017-18 (also four times for Manchester City).\nCoutinho has scored 19 Premier League goals from outside the box - one more than Robbie Fowler and second only to Steven Gerrard (33) among Liverpool players.\nSalah has been directly involved in 20 goals in his 20 Premier League games this season (15 goals, five assists) - more than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool's next match is at home to Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off).\nSwansea next play away to Watford at the same time."

We have played teams who high press, low press, attack us. Any manager and team can play how they want. And you have to find a way to beat them.\"\nEngland winger Sterling poked home from Kevin de Bruyne's lobbed pass after Sergio Aguero had twice hit the woodwork in the opening half hour.\nRolando Aarons saw a shot cleared off the line by Nicolas Otamendi in a rare Newcastle raid forward before the break, but City should have been well clear after De Bruyne thumped the post and then side-footed wide in the second half.\nThe hosts showed more ambition late on and Christian Atsu teed up fellow substitute Dwight Gayle to head wide in the final five minutes.\nReaction from St James' Park as leaders City march on\nCity were not to be denied an 18th successive league victory however as they extended an English top-flight record.\nThe Magpies' fifth successive home defeat leaves them a point off the relegation zone.\nOne-way first half\nWith the very first kick of the match, Jonjo Shelvey thumped a shot at goal which was easily gathered by Ederson. But for the next 30 minutes Newcastle did not get close to another.\nInstead the hosts sat so deep they were practically subterranean with lone striker Joselu playing 15 yards inside his own half.\nCity, brimming with confidence and well used to such tactics, sniffed out space and carved out chances regardless.\nBetween being denied by the frame, Aguero brought a superb one-handed stop from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot.\nWhen Vincent Kompany pulled up injured, Pep Guardiola felt confident enough to replace the defender with striker Gabriel Jesus.\nThe home fans were reduced to cheering throw-ins as their side's possession statistic stayed stubbornly south of 20%.\nTo hold out would have been one of the great rearguard actions. De Bruyne ensured it wasn't to be. Allowed space and time 40 yards from goal, the Belgian scooped a sublime pass onto Sterling's instep for his team-mate's 13th Premier League goal of the season.\n'A Championship side playing in the Premier League'\nAfter surviving a raft of City chances, Newcastle gave the leaders some concerns in the final 15 minutes.\nManager Rafael Benitez brought on Gayle and Atsu, urged his side to press higher and generally threw caution to the wind. A home point would have been a heist of the highest order.\nBenitez is the most streetwise of tacticians but the Spaniard is hamstrung by a squad that lacks the quality that comes with serious, sustained investment.\nThe prospect of relegation hangs over the takeover talks between owner Mike Ashley and British businesswoman Amanda Staveley that could be the key to a new era.\nClub legend Alan Shearer, watching for BBC Radio 5 live, described his former team as \"a Championship side playing in the Premier League\".\nEncounters against all-conquering City are unlikely to decide Newcastle's fate, but their next three league matches - against Brighton, Stoke and Swansea - will provide a better indication of which side of the relegation divide they will end up in May.\nCity rip up more records\nAnother win, another milestone for Manchester City.\nThis was their 11th consecutive away victory, matching the record for the English top flight set by Chelsea between April and December 2008.\nNext on the horizon is one of their manager's own.\nBeating Crystal Palace away on Sunday would equal the 19 successive wins that Bayern Munich strung together in the 2013-14 season under Guardiola. No team in the English, Italian, German, Spanish or French top flights have ever managed more than that.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\n'We have to bring someone in' - what the managers said\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez: \"We had some chances at the end, and we expected to have to defend and play counter-attack. We needed to stay compact and defend well to play like that.\n\"In the last 20 minutes we did what was expected, being on top of them and expecting to press high. I am really pleased with the team in terms of organisation, but we discussed we could be better on the ball in the first half.\n\"We have to bring someone in to help the team but still have a lot of confidence in the team.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"Any manager can decide what he wants - I prefer to try to play but I respect a lot what opponents do and we have to try to discover how to attack against them.\n\"Always you have to expect this kind of situation - and it is not always easy to maintain that level.\n\"Raheem Sterling is scoring a lot and is playing good - so we are happy with that.\"\nNewcastle's low five at home - the stats\nNewcastle have lost five consecutive home league matches for the first time since October 1953.\nNicolas Otamendi completed 122 passes for Man City in this match - seven more than all the outfield players of Newcastle managed combined (115).\nRafael Benitez has now lost six of his past 10 home Premier League matches - he had lost six of his previous 110 before this run; 38% of Benitez's total home Premier League defeats have come this season, six of 16.\nSince his Premier League debut for Manchester City, Kevin de Bruyne has 36 assists - four more than any other player.\nIn all competitions this season, only Harry Kane (24) has scored more goals than Raheem Sterling (17) among English Premier League players.\nThe Magpies have collected 18 points from their 20 Premier League matches this season - just one more than they managed after 20 games in the 2015-16 season, when they were relegated.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle play Brighton at home at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, with Manchester City travelling to Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve at 12:00."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-3 Arsenal\nManager Arsene Wenger says he cannot guarantee that striker Alexis Sanchez will remain at Arsenal long term, after the forward scored twice in the victory at Crystal Palace on Thursday.\nThe Chile striker can leave for free this summer when his contract expires and he has been linked with a move to league leaders Manchester City, who failed in their bid to sign him on deadline day.\nWhen asked about the 29-year-old's future, the Frenchman said: \"Nobody knows what will happen. It's difficult to speculate.\n\"We are focused on short term, that means the next game with the players committed and ready to fight. It's not a guarantee of how long you stay somewhere.\n\"They are questioned, always, when people don't have long contracts. The best way to show they are committed is to give that kind of performance.\"\nHis comments come only a month after he said that both Sanchez and German midfielder Mesut Ozil, whose current deal also expires in the summer, want to stay at the Emirates Stadium.\nOn Thursday, Sanchez struck twice in four minutes after Andros Townsend had cancelled out Shkodran Mustafi's first-half opener.\nThe forward squeezed a clinical strike in at the near post to make it 2-1 before bringing Jack Wilshere's superb ball from his own half under control and flicking into the net.\nJames Tomkins headed in late on but Sanchez's double was enough to secure a win that keeps sixth-placed Arsenal level on points with Tottenham, who are fifth, and one point behind fourth-placed Liverpool.\nFootball Daily podcast: 'England must take Wilshere to World Cup'\nRelive Arsenal's win at Crystal Palace\nThe best and worst of Arsenal on show\nAfter three draws and just one win from their four previous Premier League outings, this was arguably an important game for the Gunners in their bid to remain in the hunt for a top-four finish, especially after wins for rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Chelsea in midweek.\nThey started the day with six points fewer than they had at the same stage last season - and Wenger's side ultimately finished outside the Champions League places - so a positive result and performance was needed to help ease any Arsenal fans' concerns their campaign was in danger of fizzling out.\nFor large periods, the performance was certainly there. The visitors often produced some of their best attacking play of the season, particularly in the first half when Palace could not cope with short, intricate passing that time and again opened up the defence.\nBut their inability to finish off the many opportunities they created meant their opponents always had a chance to get back into the game. That proved the case early in the second half when Zaha's cross caught Arsenal's defence asleep and Townsend struck.\nA five-minute spell of Arsenal disarray followed and the Gunners could easily have found themselves falling behind, but Sanchez - so often Arsenal's saviour - settled the nerves with two moments of quality.\nBut even with a two-goal cushion Arsenal were never at ease, and Wenger's concern about his side's defensive frailties was highlighted by his decision to replace striker Lacazette with Francis Coquelin late on. That was still not enough to prevent Palace from reducing the deficit to one, setting up a tense finale.\n\"It was an excellent game, end to end, but you just cannot be convinced by Arsenal,\" former Gunners and Crystal Palace defender Matt Upson, commentating on the game for BBC Radio 5 live, said.\n\"At times, some of their passing and movement was mesmerising, just brilliant - but at the other end you see their vulnerabilities and frailties and why they are sitting sixth in the league.\"\nZaha shines again for resurgent Palace\nIt has been a strange old season for Crystal Palace.\nThey set an English football record by losing their first seven league games of the season without scoring a goal, but went into the Arsenal fixture unbeaten in eight matches - their longest such run in the top flight since 1990 and one which had moved them out of the relegation zone and into 16th.\nThe appointment of Roy Hodgson as manager has played a key role in that turnaround, but so too have the performances of Zaha.\nThe Ivory Coast forward has been in exceptional form since returning from injury in October and it was his trickery and intuition that allowed Palace to get back on level terms, jinking his way past Calum Chambers before crossing low behind a static defence for Townsend to slam home.\nOnly Jason Puncheon (32) and Chris Armstrong (31) have been involved in more Premier League goals for the Eagles than Zaha (30), underlining his importance to the team.\nThe ex-Manchester United player's form has seen him linked with a move away in January and his departure would undoubtedly be a blow for Palace.\nHowever, they showed in this game - and in recent displays - that they have enough quality elsewhere in their squad to be able continue their progress away from danger.\n\"At 1-1 I thought we were playing well and we were on the front foot, but the second goal was so difficult - to go down 2-1 was a difficult task,\" Hodgson said.\n\"You have to give the players credit. At 3-1 a lot of teams would have capitulated, but we certainly didn't do that.\n\"Our second goal was scant reward for the chances we had in the second half - but we were beaten by the better team on the day.\"\nMan of the match - Jack Wilshere\nGunners rule in London - the stats\nArsenal have won more Premier League London derbies (120) than any other side.\nRoy Hodgson has won just one of his past 12 Premier League matches against the Gunners (D3 L8).\nSanchez has had a hand in 13 goals in his past 15 Premier League London derbies (10 goals, three assists).\nWilshere has now started four consecutive league games for Arsenal for the first time since March 2014.\nCrystal Palace have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 10 league home games - their longest such run since May 2015 (15).\nZaha has provided three assists in his past two Premier League games against Arsenal.\nTownsend both scored and assisted in a league game for just the third time - and for the first since April 2016 for Newcastle against Swansea.\nWhat's next?\nIt is another tough assignment for Palace as they host Premier League leaders Manchester City on Sunday (12:00 GMT kick-off). Arsenal, meanwhile, end 2017 with a trip to West Brom, also on Sunday (16:30)."

However, Brighton struggled to threaten going forward, and their fans may also be hoping for new faces to give them an edge in the second half of the season.\nMan of the match - Mathew Ryan (Brighton)\n'We're working hard' - What the managers said\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez: \"The team is working hard, that is what you expect from these players.\n\"We did not play at the level we maybe can play but credit to Brighton because they were well organised and managed the tempo of the game quite well.\n\"Their keeper was busy but we could not score and could not get the three points, that was the main thing for us.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"I thought over the 90 minutes we were the better side, we were very worthy of the point and probably deserved a bit more.\n\"We had really good periods of possession in both halves and those are the moments you have to get your goal. I'm reasonably satisfied with the point.\n\"We deserve to be in the Premier League but we are finding the qualities in this division. It is harder to score. All you want is to be at least in the game and we have done that, apart from against Liverpool.\"\nNewcastle's home goal drought continues - the stats\nThe Magpies have scored just two goals from 71 shots in their six league games at St James' Park since the start of November (2.8%).\nThis was the fourth time that Brighton have drawn 0-0 in the Premier League this season, a joint-league-high alongside West Bromwich Albion.\nIn fact, this was the 11th time that Brighton have failed to score in 21 Premier League games this season; the most in the competition level with Crystal Palace and Swansea City.\nNewcastle made seven changes to their starting XI in this match (from their last game vs Man City) - this is the most that a side has made in a Premier League game this season.\nThis is the fourth successive Premier League game that Newcastle have made at least five changes to their starting line-up from the previous game.\nWhat's next?\nIt's a quick turnaround for Brighton, who host Bournemouth on New Year's Day at 12:30 GMT. Newcastle are also in action on 1 January, travelling to Stoke for a 15:00 kick-off."

This was a day when fortune indeed favoured the brave.\nDefensive strength not always enough\nRediscovered defensive stability, two goals conceded in seven games, and relegation fears convincingly banished - Allardyce has certainly made an impact since he took over from caretaker manager David Unsworth at the end of November.\nBut even as Everton have climbed the table on a bedrock of strong defending, they have scored just seven times in six games, with four of those contests against sides below them in the table.\nThey arrived at the Vitality Stadium having been unable to breach the defence of struggling West Brom on Boxing Day, and continued that uninspired attacking play on the south coast.\nAllardyce started with three defensive midfielders in Morgan Schneiderlin, Gueye and McCarthy, and although Gueye took his goal well, it took the introduction of an attack-minded player in Niasse to unpick the home defence.\nAllardyce also left lively wingers Ademola Lookman and Nikola Vlasic out of his matchday squad in favour of Yannick Bolasie, still returning to fitness after a year out, and another long-term absentee in McCarthy, who lasted just 45 minutes before he was replaced by Wayne Rooney.\nThe introductions of Rooney and Niasse ultimately proved to be in vain, as the visitors mustered just one shot on target in the whole match, despite facing a team that has now conceded 32 goals in 21 games this term.\n\"Our goalscoring abilities are limited, you don't need to be a manager to look at what the squad has got,\" said Allardyce, who is trying to sign Besiktas forward Cenk Tosun.\n\"It's got players who can play well and create but not many out-and-out goalscorers. That's why I work so hard on defence as we're not going to be a free-scoring team.\"\nMan of the match - Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth)\nCherries will miss King - the stats\nJoshua King has had a hand in 31 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (24 goals, 7 assists), 12 more than any other player.\nKing has scored three and assisted three against the Toffees in the Premier League, more goal involvements (6) than he has managed against any other side in the competition.\nBournemouth's victory ended a club-record-equalling run of eight Premier League games without a win (D4 L4).\nEverton conceded two goals against Bournemouth, as many as they had shipped in their previous six Premier League games under Sam Allardyce.\nThe Toffees suffered their first league defeat under Allardyce, after winning three and drawing three of their first six under their new boss.\nIdrissa Gueye scored his first goal in his last 32 Premier League appearances, since netting against Sunderland in February.\nOumar Niasse has scored three and assisted one in his last six Premier League sub appearances.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Brighton on New Year's Day (12:30 GMT) while Everton host Manchester United at Goodison Park on the same day (17:30 GMT)."

I told the referee after but it was his decision.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said it was \"impossible\" that a spot-kick was not awarded.\n\"Jeff has gone down in a natural manner and he does not get it,\" he said.\n\"It seems people who go down in a theatrical way do get it [penalty decisions], but Jeff goes down in a natural way as his foot is clearly taken away, but he does not get it.\nIt was a game in which Dyche's side enjoyed the better openings, particularly in a first-half which saw a Hendrick goal ruled out for offside, before Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Steven Defour flashed wide of Lossl's left and right goalposts respectively.\nRelive Huddersfield's draw with Burnley as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nHuddersfield were content to sit deep and absorb pressure, creating little in attack, but they were almost caught out late on when former Terrier Nahki Wells, on as a substitute for the Clarets, saw Lossl's legs block his toe-poked effort from close range.\nInstead, it was a repeat of the result in the reverse fixture at Turf Moor in September.\nA point for the home side means they stay 11th in the Premier League, keeping the gap to the bottom three at six. Burnley remain in the heady heights of seventh, with a seven-point cushion over Leicester in eighth.\n'He made me go down'\nThe introduction of VAR (video assistant referee) is coming to English football in 2018, but it wasn't there in time for Burnley in this match.\nIn the big talking point of an otherwise unremarkable encounter, Hendrick went to ground after being clearly caught by Lossl - it looked like a penalty in real-time and the replays only made Paul Tierney's decision to not point to the spot look worse.\n\"I felt contact and he [Lossl] made me go down,\" the Republic of Ireland midfielder, who was not booked for diving, said of the incident.\n\"The referee said he didn't think it was a dive, but that I lost my footing and he didn't think the goalkeeper touched me.\"\nTown boss David Wagner admitted his side had been \"lucky\" with the decision.\nThe Clarets are now winless in their past four league games, but there were plenty of positives to draw from this performance and only Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United (both 10) have kept more Premier League clean sheets than Burnley (nine) this season.\nTerriers should accentuate the positives\nThis was a meeting of the two biggest surprise stories of the Premier League season so far, and as the scoreline testifies, there was little between them.\nBurnley had the better chances, yes, but while the Terriers were somewhat made to look like the away side, they were comfortable in absorbing pressure for the most part.\nAnd given the penalty decision went in their favour, supporters of Wagner's side should see this as firstly a let-off and latterly a good point.\nThey will begin the new year just outside the top half and with a good cushion to the relegation zone, a fact that caps a memorable year, having made a return to the top flight for the first time in 45 years by winning May's play-off final, and briefly (very, very briefly) topping the table.\nIn avoiding defeat, they have now lost just one of their past six Premier League games - their best run so far this season.\n'Burnley backed up their league position' - what they said\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"It was a very tough game and we are very pleased with a point as you can see why Burnley are seventh in the Premier League.\n\"They had the better chances, they had more chances, but it was a point we had to to work hard for and that is what the players have done.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"It was a very dominant performance in the first half. Huddersfield are going well but we had a dominant performance.\"\nMan of the match - Christopher Schindler (Huddersfield)\nTerriers and Clarets at stalemate again - the stats\nOnly Manchester City (30), Chelsea (20), Manchester United (18) and Liverpool (18) have won more away points in the Premier League this season than Burnley (17).\nIndeed, Burnley have kept as many away clean sheets in the Premier League this season (four in 11 games), as they did in the whole of 2016-17 (four in 19 games).\nBurnley have lost just three of their 21 league meetings with Huddersfield Town since March 1971 (W11 D7 L3).\nBoth fixtures between these two teams this season finished 0-0 - the first time they've shared two goalless draws in a single league campaign.\nThis was the eighth time this season that Burnley named an unchanged starting XI in the Premier League; more often than any other team.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield begin 2018 with a trip to Leicester on 1 January (15:00 GMT); on the same day, Burnley entertain Liverpool at Turf Moor (also 15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-2 Swansea City\nSwansea City staged a remarkable late fightback to beat Watford and give Carlos Carvalhal victory in his first game in charge of the Welsh side, lifting them off the bottom of the table.\nIn a lively start to the match, Jordan Ayew struck the bar from 25 yards for the visitors before Andre Carrillo headed Watford in front on 11 minutes.\nNeither side seized control of the match in a disjointed second half and, as the nervous hosts retreated with five minutes left, Swans substitute Oli McBurnie nodded down for Ayew to convert from close range.\nIn the 89th minute, Heurelho Gomes saved a powerful effort from Nathan Dyer but could only push it into the path of another Swansea substitute, Luciano Narsingh, who finished well to spark ecstatic celebrations in the dugout and the away end.\nJust a fourth win from 21 Premier League games this season sees Carvalhal's side overtake West Brom, who are now at the foot of the table, and moves them within two points of safety.\nFor Watford, a fifth defeat from six league matches sees them stay in 10th place.\nCarvalhal's dramatic start\nThere was an element of surprise to Carvalhal's appointment, coming as it did just days after he was dismissed by Sheffield Wednesday with the Owls 15th in the Championship table.\nHowever, the Portuguese's penchant for attractive football was in keeping with the Swans' ethos of previous years - and it was evident in the early stages at Vicarage Road, one crisp passing move ending with a rasping 25-yard shot from Ayew which hit the bar.\nDespite that promise, the fragility of the Swansea players' confidence was exposed by the opening goal as their static defence allowed Richarlison through to fire a shot which Lukasz Fabianski could only push towards Carrillo for a simple close-range header.\nThe visitors' heads dropped from that point, the recalled Renato Sanches cutting a frustrated figure as he and his midfield team-mates struggled to find a balance in their flat 4-4-2 formation.\nCarvalhal brought on winger Narsingh as well as Nathan Dyer and young striker Oli McBurnie - for Roque Mesa and Tammy Abraham, who had both disappointed - in an effort to rejuvenate his side, and it proved an inspired move.\nWatford surrendered the initiative in the closing stages of the match and Swansea appeared to feed off their opponents' nerves.\nMcBurnie showed great composure to head the ball down to Ayew, who volleyed in the equaliser with four minutes left to send the travelling supporters into raptures.\nAnd to the disbelief of many at Vicarage Road, the Swans struck again three minutes later, Narsingh's late goal breathing new life into the Welsh side's bid for survival and marking a dramatic start to Carvalhal's reign.\nWatford let it slip\nWatford had ended a run of four successive defeats when they beat Leicester on Boxing Day, and their energetic start against Swansea suggested Marco Silva's side were rediscovering some of the form which took them within three points of the Champions League spots earlier this season.\nRicharlison tormented Swansea's defenders when he drifted infield from the left wing, while Abdoulaye Doucoure was central to the Hornets' efforts to outmuscle their meek opponents in midfield.\nThe home side had chances to extend their lead, with Richarlison seeing a header saved by Fabianski and Molla Wague having a goal disallowed after pushing Tammy Abraham at a corner.\nSwansea seemed there for the taking at times but Watford failed to take advantage, allowing the game to pass them by as time wore on, inviting pressure.\nIt proved to be costly as a hitherto toothless Swans side appeared emboldened by their opponents' inability to kill the game off and, after Ayew struck the equaliser, Watford only had themselves to blame as Narsingh latched on to Gomes' save from Dyer.\nMan of the match - Oli McBurnie (Swansea City)\n'We had to kill the game'\nWatford boss Marco Silva speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's really hard to take. We are disappointed, our fans are as well.\n\"We did enough to win the match. We controlled the match. They had one shot off the bar but we controlled the match, scored one goal and had more chances to kill the match, even seconds before the goal.\n\"At this level, when you don't score, it gives them belief. One cross after, they score one goal and it looks a bit offside. Even with 1-1 we need to be different, to keep focus to the end.\n\"We did enough to win. We need to kill the match and that is a gift for them. We created enough chances to comfortably win this match.\"\nSwansea manager Carlos Carvalhal speaking to Match of the Day: \"We tried everything to win. Watford are very strong. We felt a little lucky in moments, but Watford were lucky also.\n\"The game is like this, but we prepared very well, changed the formation and had just two training sessions with the team.\n\"I must give congratulations to my players. They are better players than they are showing. They need a plan and a dynamic. During the game they were better and better.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Premier League leaders Manchester City on Tuesday (kick-off, 20:00 GMT), while Swansea host Tottenham (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-1 Leicester City\nManager Jurgen Klopp called Liverpool's reaction to going a goal down against Leicester the \"best I've ever seen\" after Mohamed Salah's double helped them come from behind to win at Anfield.\nJamie Vardy gave the visitors an early lead when he poked home from a Riyad Mahrez pass before Salah equalised in the second half.\nThe Egypt international then turned Harry Maguire on the edge of the area before firing in his second of the day - and 17th Premier League goal of the season - to give Liverpool the lead.\nKlopp described the hosts' performance as \"perfect\" and the Reds, who will finish the year in fourth place, extended their unbeaten run to 15 games.\nLeicester stay in eighth but have now gone five games without a victory.\n\"On perfect days we win football games,\" said Klopp.\n\"The crowd were unbelievable and we needed them today to score these two goals. It's a good team performance and a well-deserved win.\"\nThe only concern will surround the fitness of match-winner Salah, who Klopp said was \"limping\" when he was substituted with less than 10 minutes left to play.\n\"We have to check it,\" added the German. \"We tried to change it as quick as possible and of course that is not too good.\"\nKlopp uncertain over Salah injury\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nRelive Liverpool's victory over Leicester\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nKlopp's men show persistence\nLiverpool have failed to capitalise on their chances too many times this season - having to settle for draws against both West Brom and Spartak Moscow after dominating for 90 minutes.\nThat was not the case on Saturday as the Reds battled through a tough defensive unit to come back from a goal down against the 2016 Premier League champions.\nThere were still plenty of missed opportunities - Salah squandered four efforts in the first half alone, before Liverpool's top scorer made up for it with two clinical finishes after the break.\nIt still took 17 shots, six on target, for the hosts to get the result they needed but the recovery from falling behind so early is an encouraging sign for Klopp's side as they head into the new year.\nAt the other end, it was a fairly solid performance from centre-back duo Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip, who have both been criticised for their performances at times this season.\nOverall, Klopp has much to be pleased about after his team produced a persistent display against the Foxes, who have so far been something of a bogey side for the German manager.\nBefore Saturday's victory, the Reds had lost three times against Leicester under Klopp - more than they have to any other club since he took over in October 2015.\nVardy continues to haunt Reds\nLeicester went into half-time with the lead thanks to yet another goal from Vardy - his 10th of the season.\nHis record against Liverpool is impressive - scoring seven of Leicester's past nine goals against the Reds in the Premier League.\nIt was no surprise to see him identified as a threat before the game and he was just that - running in behind the defenders and looking to find spaces behind Liverpool's back four.\nThere were signs of danger for the home side when Vardy found space on the left even before his third-minute opener.\nHe could have doubled Leicester's lead shortly before half-time too but for a heavy touch which allowed Lovren time to recover.\nEven after Salah's equaliser, England striker Vardy continued to be a constant threat, with the offside flag coming to Liverpool's aid on more than one occasion.\nIt was therefore a surprise to see him substituted with the teams level - alongside Mahrez, who had assisted Vardy's early goal.\nThe pair have scored in five of the Foxes' seven games this month and fans will no doubt question Claude Puel's decision to take both of them off with more than 15 minutes still left to play.\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool manager Klopp: \"It is a maximum satisfaction to win like this today and on perfect days we win football games. Today was pretty much perfect.\n\"When we were one goal down our reaction was the best I've ever seen in this situation. The crowd were unbelievable and we needed them today to score these two goals.\n\"Mo [Salah] was fantastic with his dribbling and his vision. I couldn't ask more from him. Staying in the game is the real deal of football in this league - but I am happy for Mo, I am happy for the team, because this group is a fantastic group of players. It's a good team performance and a well-deserved win.\"\nLeicester manager Puel: \"Of course, after a defeat it is a disappointment - but Liverpool played their best today.\n\"We did well to score first and we tried to keep that in the second half. We need to continue our work, but it is important to concentrate on the game on Monday and forget this game to move forward.\n\"We lost the ball too quickly and we could have launched counter-attacks better, but it was a good game with a positive attitude of unselfish players and now we must look forward to Monday.\"\nProlific Salah - the best of the stats\nLiverpool have scored 77 goals in 30 games so far this season - their highest total at this stage of a campaign as a top-flight club.\nAfter winning four in a row under Puel, the Foxes have since gone four Premier League games without a win, losing three, and have lost consecutive league matches for the first time since September.\nSalah has been directly involved in 22 goals in 21 league appearances for Liverpool this season (17 goals, five assists).\nSalah (23 goals) has scored more goals in all competitions this season than eight Premier League clubs (Crystal Palace, Burnley, Brighton, Swansea, West Brom, Huddersfield, Southampton and Newcastle).\nOf Vardy's 51 Premier League goals, 22 have come against 'big six opposition' (43%).\nVardy (seven) has scored more Premier League goals against Liverpool than against any other team. Only Andrew Cole (11) and Thierry Henry (eight) have scored more Premier League goals against the Reds than Vardy.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah\nMan of the match could easily have been awarded to Harry Maguire, who defended with every part of his body as Leicester tried to cling on. In the end, it was Salah who proved the difference and for all his efforts, Maguire could not stop him from completing the Reds' comeback.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Turf Moor to take on Burnley in the league on New Year's Day (15:00 GMT) - a fourth game in 10 days for Klopp's side.\nLeicester will aim to bounce back when they host Huddersfield Town at the same time, as they too struggle with a busy calendar."

We just have to give everything in every game to try and get three points, and then at the end of the season we will see what happens.\"\nChelsea can afford to rest players\nWith Wednesday's trip to top-four rivals Arsenal in mind, Chelsea boss Antonio Conte left Hazard on the bench and never needed to consider bringing him on.\nThe game was so straightforward, he could probably have rested his entire first 11.\nConte made three changes from the side who beat Brighton 2-0 on Boxing Day, and the first four goals were scored or set up by the trio to come in - Pedro, Willian and Drinkwater.\nRudiger rose highest to head an early opener from Willian's set piece, before Pedro's deflected cross found Drinkwater to smash home his first Chelsea goal.\nWillian then picked out Pedro to score a third.\nThe second half lacked any competitive edge and Conte was able to bring off N'Golo Kante, Alvaro Morata - who missed two relatively straightforward chances - and Victor Moses to keep them fresh for Wednesday.\nWillian scored a penalty after he had been fouled by Geoff Cameron, and Zappacosta scored his first Premier League goal from just outside the box late on.\nSorry Stoke thrashed again\nStoke boss Mark Hughes is under pressure and a heavy defeat against his old club will not have helped. The Potters, who are two points above the relegation zone, have now conceded five goals or more in three Premier League games this season.\nIn truth, circumstances and tactical decisions meant a positive result against the champions never appeared likely.\nStoke had four defenders out injured, and Kurt Zouma was ineligible to play against his parent club. Stoke had only ever started teenagers in five Premier League games, but Josh Tymon and Thomas Edwards both faced the Blues.\nHughes rested Xherdan Shaqiri, Joe Allen, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Peter Crouch, with the home game against relegation rivals Newcastle on Monday in mind.\nThe visitors only had one shot in the entire game - Saido Berahino's feeble effort at Thibaut Courtois when through on goal. The striker has not scored a goal since February 2016.\nReaction: Hughes 'pragmatic' with his team\nStoke boss Hughes confirmed that he rested several key players because of their two-day turnaround, adding he would have named a stronger side if his team had four days off like Chelsea.\n\"There was always going to be a risk with the back four but they're all we had,\" he told BBC Match of the Day. \"The two young lads in defence did their best in difficult circumstances. The back four had never played together.\n\"We've got to go again on Monday so we had to protect a number of players. I take responsibility for this, it was my decision. But the feeling is we're in better shape for Monday - if we win that, we've had a decent Christmas period.\n\"If we had Chelsea's schedule, we'd have picked Xherdan Shaqiri, Joe Allen and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and had a go. We've been put in a difficult position.\n\"Our record here is poor. It was going to be very difficult to get a positive result even with a full-strength side. Sometimes you have to be pragmatic and take your medicine.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte told BBC Sport: \"Today we were very good, we started very well and to score twice after 15 minutes, another clean sheet, there are a lot of positives after this game.\n\"But at the same time we know we must continue to work and improve, and prepare for a very difficult game against Arsenal.\n\"Every win is important for us. Today it was important to get three points to continue our positive run.\"\nMan of the match - Pedro\nMatch stats - Stoke's worst start in Premier League\nChelsea have conceded just four goals in their last 12 Premier League games, keeping eight clean sheets on the way.\nStoke's total of 20 points after 21 games is their worst-ever haul at this stage of a Premier League season.\nSome 21 of Chelsea's top-flight goals this season have come via Spanish players, more than any other side in Europe's big five leagues - including La Liga.\nThe Potters have registered a league-low two clean sheets in the top-flight this season; indeed, in Europe's big five leagues, only Serie A strugglers Benevento have kept fewer (1).\nThe Blues have scored a divisional-high 13 headed goals this season.\nJosh Tymon is just the third teenager to start a Premier League game for the Potters, after Ramadan Sobhi and Thomas Edwards.\nWillian has been directly involved in six goals in his last four Premier League games against Stoke (4 goals, 2 assists).\nFive of Pedro's last seven Premier League goals have come from outside the box."

But I am really unhappy with the penalty. Not with Craig's performance overall, but with the penalty. I think Craig had a game without problems, but it is a big decision.\"\nYoshida admitted he was fortunate not to be penalised, saying: \"Sometimes we get decisions from the referee and sometimes we get bad luck from them. Today we got good luck.\"\nStriker Romelu Lukaku was taken off on a stretcher for the hosts in the first half, having earlier headed a good chance over the bar.\nPaul Pogba did have the ball in the net for Mourinho's side late on, but his effort was ruled out for offside.\nBut Southampton also had opportunities to win the game.\nGoalkeeper David de Gea somehow managed to guide Shane Long's effort over the crossbar with his foot from Saints' best chance.\nMauricio Pellegrino's side have now gone eight games without a win since the 4-1 thrashing of Everton on 26 November.\nUnited concern for Lukaku\nMourinho spoke at length before Saturday's game about how Lukaku was suffering from fatigue, having played every minute of the club's Premier League campaign.\nThe Belgium striker was again chosen to lead the line at Old Trafford, with the Portuguese saying \"I cannot rest him\".\nAfter beginning his United career with 11 goals in 10 games Lukaku has netted only four in the last 19, and headed over a good chance from Juan Mata's inviting cross after just three minutes.\nBut that would be the 24-year-old's last involvement, with the striker clashing heads with Southampton defender Wesley Hoedt and having to be taken off on a stretcher.\nIt was a concerning sight for Mourinho and Manchester United with the game stopped for five minutes as the medical team kept the forward on the pitch before moving him.\nLukaku, who remained conscious, departed to applause from both sets of supporters.\nMourinho's money men fail to shine\n\"Money\" has been the word on Manchester United boss Mourinho's lips recently, with the Portuguese insisting the club cannot compete with Manchester City's spending.\nHe also asked journalists to question Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp over his 2016 threat to quit the game rather than spend inflated transfer fees, after the Reds agreed a \u00a375m deal to sign Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk on 1 January.\nA United starting XI assembled for \u00a3378m failed to break down Southampton, even without the soon-to-be world's most expensive defender Van Dijk.\nLukaku's chance was probably the best of the first half, but Mata also forced a save from Alex McCarthy - replacing the dropped Fraser Forster in the Saints' goal - and Jesse Lingard glanced a header wide when in a good position.\nPogba then poked in from close range from an offside position late on, but United offered little without the threat of Lukaku, while striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was not named in the squad because of injury.\nMarcus Rashford was the man chosen to replace Lukaku, and it was he and another one of United's academy products, Lingard, that looked most likely to create something among a team of expensive names.\nBut Southampton had the nous to deal with the pace and trickery of United's youngsters, picking up an important point in the process.\nStubborn Saints take well-earned point\nFew would have expected Southampton to come away from Old Trafford with a victory, despite doing so on two of their past three visits, and even though they increased their winless run to eight games it was a well-earned point for Pellegrino's side.\nHaving shipped five goals in a defeat by Tottenham at Wembley on Boxing Day, the visitors had clearly addressed their defensive issues and put in an assured performance.\nYoshida and Hoedt, with young full-backs Sam McQueen and Jack Stephens outside them, marshalled a well-organised back four that allowed United few chances.\nThere were signs of encouragement for the visitors going forward, too, with James Ward-Prowse forcing De Gea into a save in the first half and Long seeing his effort turned over after the break.\nUnited's frustration was clear, with Ashley Young appearing to elbow Dusan Tadic in the stomach when marking the Saints midfielder.\nHowever, this run makes grim reading for Southampton fans, with the side suffering their longest streak without a victory since the 2004-05 season, in which they finished bottom and were relegated.\nThe south-coast outfit sit 13th, but are just two points above the relegation zone heading in 2018 and how they reinvest the \u00a375m they are set to receive for Van Dijk in January could well determine how they fare next year.\nPellegrino says Southampton already have targets in mind.\n\"It's good because we have our targets,\" he added. \"We have a couple of targets we'd like to bring in, but with the transfer market you never know what's going to happen.\"\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Southampton)\n'Disappointing afternoon for the referee'\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"I think it is also a disappointing afternoon for Craig [Pawson, the referee] because he's a fantastic referee, one of the best in Europe.\n\"I'm happy with the players' attitude, the players' desire and I'm very happy with my place.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"We were solid and we had our moments in the game. United had moments where they were uncomfortable on the pitch and we played really well.\n\"We can use this performance as an example for the next game. Today I think our positioning was good and we did very well.\"\nUnited's scoring run comes to an end - the stats\nManchester United are now winless in four competitive matches, their worst run since May 2017, when the fourth game in that run was also against Southampton.\nThis match ended a 20-game scoring run for Manchester United at Old Trafford in all competitions - they last failed to score at home on 1 April against West Brom.\nSouthampton have lost just one of their last five trips to Old Trafford against Manchester United (W2 D2 L1).\nThis was the 16th time in Southampton's last 33 competitive games that they have failed to score.\nSince Jose Mourinho's first game in charge of Manchester United in August 2016, the Red Devils have won 113 points from 59 Premier League games - fewer than Chelsea (138), Man City (136), Spurs (123) and Liverpool (117).

Today is completely different to 2004.\n\"There are now more strong teams, a lot of competitions, a lot of games.\"\nGuardiola left Selhurst Park with two injury concerns - striker Gabriel Jesus leaving the field in tears in the first half, and playmaker Kevin de Bruyne taken off on a stretcher after a heavy tackle from Jason Puncheon in the final minute.\nIt leaves City with only one fit senior striker in Sergio Aguero, who came on for Jesus.\nListen to BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily Podcast\nRelive Sunday's goalless draw at Selhurst Park\nPalace energy gets deserved point\nPalace were rewarded as their defensive grit and off-the-ball energy shone through in an enthralling contest.\nThe question, after they pressed so ferociously in the first half, was whether they were fit enough in the midst of the congested Christmas fixture list to keep it up.\nBut they did just that, with midfielder Milivojevic covering more ground than anyone on the pitch (12.69 km), though that will be of little consolation after his spot-kick - given when Raheem Sterling fouled Wilfried Zaha in the box in the 92nd minute - was saved.\nThe point means the Eagles start the new year outside of the bottom three, a point above West Ham in 18th - symbolic for a club that suffered seven straight defeats without scoring during their miserable start to the season.\nThey also secured only their second home clean sheet in the league all season, against a team that has scored 102 goals in 2017.\nThe downside to playing their energetic part in such an eventful contest was a first-half injury to centre-back Scott Dann, with boss Roy Hodgson already light on defenders in Mamadou Sakho's absence because of a calf problem.\nBut they can take heart from creating other opportunities to win aside from the penalty - full-back Patrick van Aanholt testing Ederson in the first half and Andros Townsend wasting a gilt-edged chance to convert on 78 minutes.\nWith Yohan Cabaye playing further forward than he did in their defeat by Arsenal, Palace had a courage with the ball to match their resilience off it.\n\"I'm very proud of the team's performance,\" said Hodgson. \"I know how difficult it is to play a team of Manchester City's quality.\n\"Before the game we would have been jumping through hoops at having claimed a point, then you get a penalty late in the game, so there is an element of sadness at a chance missed.\n\"But I've said to the players: 'Continue that level of performance week after week and we've got a good chance of staying in the league.'\"\nNo crisis for City but wear and tear mounts\nNot winning their 19th consecutive league game is hardly evidence of the wheels coming off City's title charge, but there were signs that could be problematic in south London.\nTheir ninth game in December saw more onus on the considerable creativity of De Bruyne in David Silva's continued absence.\nBut the Belgian's set-pieces were off colour - only one of six deliveries was dangerous, and his passing accuracy (80%) was less than any other starting City player.\nNow Guardiola may have to cope without him after that late withdrawal, although he appeared able to walk alongside club physios after being carried off.\nLeroy Sane could step up to fill the gap in the coming weeks, but he struggled too. The 21-year-old won only half of his 14 duels, and was often second best to Palace defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah.\nHe was meekly dispossessed by the on-loan Manchester United man in the first half, and berated by De Bruyne over the timing of another run. Then he was booked for kicking the ball away in frustration.\nIt remains to be seen if Guardiola moves to bolster his attack by prising Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal in January, however the City boss said in his post-match news conference that he expects the forward to stay with the Gunners.\n\"He is a player for Arsenal and I think he is going to stay there,\" he said. \"In two days we have another game after that we have meetings. My feeling now is Alexis is an Arsenal player.\"\nMan of the match - Kyle Walker (Manchester City)\nRare away blank for City - the stats\nThis was City's first away goalless draw in the Premier League since March 2016 against Norwich City, ending a run of 34 matches in which at least one goal was scored.\nOnly two teams have won more Premier League points in a calendar year than City in 2017 (98) - Man Utd in 1993 (102) and Chelsea in 2005 (101).\nPalace have only lost one of their past 10 Premier League games (W3 D6), having lost 13 of their 16 before this run.\nHodgson has now failed to see his side score in his past five Premier League matches against Man City (D2 L3), a goalless run that stands at 465 minutes.\nThis was Palace's fourth clean sheet in their past eight Premier League games, as many as they had managed in their 25 matches prior to this.\nCity goalkeepers have saved 10 of the past 17 penalties they've faced in all competitions, with four different goalkeepers saving those 10 (Joe Hart, Claudio Bravo, Willy Caballero and Ederson).\nWayne Hennessey was the first Palace goalkeeper since Nigel Martyn in May 1993 to keep a Premier League clean sheet against City.\nPalace have missed five penalties since the start of last season, two more than any other Premier League side.\nSterling is the only Premier League player to have both won and conceded a penalty this season.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to St Mary's Stadium to face Southampton on 2 January (19:45 GMT), while Manchester City host Watford on the same evening (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Arsenal\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes referee Mike Dean \"did not see\" the incident that led him to award a late penalty to West Brom in the Gunners' 1-1 draw at The Hawthorns.\nThe visitors were on course for three points after Alexis Sanchez's 83rd-minute free-kick beat Baggies goalkeeper Ben Foster via a big deflection off James McClean in the wall.\nBut, with a minute of normal time remaining, Calum Chambers was judged to have handled as Kieran Gibbs tried to nudge the ball past him in the area.\nJay Rodriguez fired the resulting spot-kick past Petr Cech to earn the struggling hosts a point.\nWenger said: \"Many years ago [former Arsenal vice-chairman] David Dein and myself fought hard for referees to become professional and they do a good job, but don't work enough.\n\"We have a very difficult schedule and I believe we fought hard to win the game, but didn't because of a bad decision.\n\"[Dean] didn't see it. There was a player in front of him. That's why I questioned his decision, he didn't see it.\"\nMatch of the Day 2 pundits Shay Given and Leon Osman disagreed - saying Dean had a clear view - but both described the decision as \"generous\".\nWest Brom counterpart Alan Pardew acknowledged it was a \"fortunate penalty\".\nHe added: \"If I was the opposing manager then I might not have thought it was a penalty.\"\nBoth goals came in a dramatic final 10 minutes of a largely uninspiring game with few clear-cut chances.\nArsenal move three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool while West Brom climb off the bottom of the table on goal difference.\nListen to BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily Podcast\nRelive the action from The Hawthorns\nWas it a penalty?\nArsenal's players protested both at the time of the decision and after the final whistle, when Cech was booked and Wenger spoke to Dean.\nThe incident came a day after Southampton defender Maya Yoshida was deemed not to be at fault when he handled the ball against Manchester United, but there was no such good fortune for Chambers.\nWith Arsenal just moments away from securing victory, former Gunners full-back Gibbs' attempt to push the ball past Chambers struck the arm of the defender. Chambers had little time to move his arm out of the way, but the referee judged it to be intentional.\nThat left Wenger and his players aggrieved just minutes after they had taken the lead rather fortuitously when Sanchez's free-kick took a big deflection off McClean to wrong-foot Foster.\nBefore that, the visitors rarely troubled the Baggies backline, though Alexandre Lacazette went close twice.\nAnd the late controversy meant they missed the chance to really close on the Champions League places, with a match against second-placed Chelsea to come on Wednesday.\nBaggies earn point but lack bounce\nWest Brom were fortunate to come away with anything from a display that appeared focused on defending.\nBefore the penalty, only Rodriguez's second-half strike that stung the palms of Cech had the home crowd off their seats.\nIt is now no wins in 19 matches for Pardew's side, equalling the longest such run in the Premier League since Aston Villa's sequence ended in January 2016.\nThe Baggies will have another chance to end that run on Tuesday when they play West Ham.\nMan of the match - Gareth Barry (West Brom)\n'We will get the break' - the reaction\nWest Brom boss Alan Pardew: \"It is a tough decision on Arsenal, but we deserved a break.\n\"If we keep going with that level of commitment, we will get the breaks to win. Liverpool was better, Everton was better, but we went toe-to-toe at times with Arsenal as much as we could, and they have got their rewards.\n\"We need to win a game, but we have not won, we have another point on the board but we need to turn them into wins by getting a second and third goal.\"\nBlank Cech - the stats\nArsenal have scored in all 24 of their Premier League games against West Brom - the best 100% record in the competition.\nCech has failed to save any of the 13 penalties he has faced in all competitions for Arsenal - only two keepers have faced more at a single club without saving one (Brad Friedel at Aston Villa, Craig Gordon at Sunderland - both 15).\nWenger took charge of his 811th Premier League game - more than any other manager in the competition (W468 D198 L145).\nThis was the first point West Brom had won from a losing position in the Premier League this season.\nRodriguez has played more Premier League games against Arsenal than he has any other opponent (eight) though this was his first goal against them.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom are at the Hammers' London Stadium on Tuesday, and the Gunners host London rivals Chelsea on Wednesday."

We spoke about areas we need to address, opportunities to score more goals and be creative.\n\"We had by far the better of the clear-cut chances. To come in at 2-2, having led twice, it feels like two points lost. What should have been 3-1 becomes 2-2.\n\"This is a game we deserved to win, but haven't lost - we need to take that mentality into the next few games.\n\"We will try to do some business, but it's not a great market in January.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It's frustrating for us that we gave them goals at the start of both halves but the lads showed great fighting spirit to come back.\n\"The timing and the manner we conceded was disappointing. We had to work so hard, and it's been a feature of our recent games.\n\"It's good to see us scoring again, but we needed to defend better to win.\"\nNew records for Brighton - the best of the stats\nBrighton scored as many goals against Bournemouth as they did in their previous nine Premier League games.\nBournemouth have now scored 50 away goals in the Premier League.\nWilson has scored 16 Premier League goals without providing an assist - the most a player has scored in the competition without assisting.\nMurray has six Premier League goals this season, just one off his best tally in a single top-flight campaign (seven goals in 2014-15).\nOnly Scott Dann (nine) has scored more Premier League goals than Cook (eight) of all central defenders in the competition since August 2015.\nBrighton's opener was their quickest Premier League goal (four minutes 32 seconds) and just their sixth in the first half of a match in the competition this season.\nIzquierdo became the first Brighton player to register two assists in a single Premier League game.\nMan of the match - Pascal Gross (Brighton)\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams turn their attention to the FA Cup for third-round weekend.

We are resolute defensively, we have added to what we had. The quality has risen.\n\"To be on 34 points and be unfortunate to not have 35 shows what a season we have had.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"A fantastic finish to the game. This is one of the toughest places to play all season.\n\"I like rotation, I love the quality of my squad and I am really pleased. It was not fantastic football but it was a fantastic attitude.\n\"Today it wasn't possible to play brilliantly but it was an open game, we had a massive setback with the equaliser but we changed it again - we haven't done that too often this year.\"\nKlopp's best run so far - the stats you may have missed\nLiverpool have now gone 16 games unbeaten in all competitions (W11 D5), their longest run under Jurgen Klopp.\nThis is also Klopp's longest run of matches without a defeat in the Premier League (13 games).\nBurnley have conceded more goals in their past two Premier League games at Turf Moor (five) than they did in in their first nine of the season (three).\nThe Clarets have not won any of their past five league games (D3 L2); they last went longer without a victory in the top-flight in April last season (seven games).\nGudmundsson has been directly involved in six Premier League goals this season, at least two more than any other player for Burnley.\nMane has had a hand in five goals in his past four Premier League games away from Anfield (two goals, three assists), as many as his previous 15 combined.\nKlavan scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool in his 34th appearance in the competition; it was the first goal by an Estonian in Premier League history.\nFollowing Klavan's goal, players of 97 different nationalities have now scored a Premier League goal (excluding own goals).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley face Man City in the FA Cup on Saturday at 15:00 GMT, and are back in Premier League action on 13 January, when they travel to Crystal Palace at 15:00.\nLiverpool host Everton in a Merseyside derby in the FA Cup on Friday at 19:55.

I like this player and I'd like to keep our best players,\" he said.\n\"We will ask him the question.\"\nMahrez, whose contract expires in the summer of 2020, put in a transfer request last May, but remained with the Foxes after Roma had a final bid of more than \u00a327m rejected.\nThe 26-year-old scored the opener against Huddersfield, expertly guiding home a side-foot volley from Marc Albrighton's up-and-under into the box.\nSeven minutes later he set up Islam Slimani with a precise though-ball and his countryman dinked a cool finish over Jonas Lossl.\nHuddersfield rarely threatened, with wayward shots from Tom Ince and Collin Quaner the closest they came to a reply.\nInstead the late stages were notable for Leicester midfielder Adrien Silva making his debut off the bench - four months after late submission of paperwork for his move from Sporting Lisbon left him unable to play - and Albrighton's injury-time third from Demarai Gray's deflected cross.\nRelive Leicester's victory at the King Power Stadium\nSilva finally completes \u00a322m Leicester move\nMahrez moments of magic light up match\nWhile still short of the stratospheric standards set during Leicester's 2015-16 title win, this season's version of Mahrez has been a significant upgrade on the pallid variety seen last term.\nHis goal was a superb demonstration of his technical ability, coolly steering an awkward dropping ball into the far corner from a tight angle.\nMahrez's pass for Slimani's strike was made easier by the Huddersfield defence's kamikaze high line, but was perfectly weighted to send the striker clear of the chasing Terriers.\nSeven goals and seven assists in the Premier League this season dwarf his respective totals - six and three - for the whole of 2016-17.\nHis upturn in form has been appreciated by the King Power crowd who gave him a standing ovation as he departed in the 77th minute.\nBut it has also been noted elsewhere, with Arsenal among several clubs whose reported interest\n, external\nwill be strengthened by this performance.\nToothless Terriers suffer on the road\nHuddersfield fans who attended the club's last away game at Southampton were thanked for their support with drinks bought by defender Mathias Jorgensen.\nThe travelling contingent have had little else to warm themselves on the road.\nThis was the eighth time in 11 Premier League away trips that their side have failed to score.\nThey rarely looked like bucking that trend against the Foxes.\nDanny Williams scuffed wide from the edge of the box in the visitors' best chance of the first half before Ince and Quaner efforts flew well off target.\nBoss David Wagner had set his side up with a high defensive line which, with Jamie Vardy absent with a slight groin strain, initially proved effective in keeping the less mobile pairing of Slimani and Shinji Okazaki at bay.\nOnce Mahrez had scuppered any hopes of goalless draw and a point, however, Huddersfield lacked the quality up front to really threaten a comeback.\nSilva holds his value\nIt had initially been reported that, after enduring four months in limbo, Silva would have to wait another few days until he was be eligible for selection.\nInstead the Premier League gave Leicester permission to pick the \u00a322m Portugal international and the scoreline gave him a pressure-free eight-minute cameo late on.\nWearing 14 - the same number of seconds by which his paperwork was late in August - he came on for Matty James to the delight of the home fans.\nThey cheered all eight of the touches he managed before the final whistle, but their chanted promises to invade the pitch if he scored came to nothing with Albrighton instead being in the right place to poke in a third.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Leicester)\n'The spirit to play football' - what they said\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"After the end of the first half, perhaps it was not enough - we lacked quality. We came back in the second half with the same spirit to play football on the floor and with quality.\n\"We lost Wes Morgan and we will see his injury tomorrow.\"\nOn Adrien Silva's debut: \"He kept a good, positive attitude. It's a good thing to see him on the pitch and he can bring some good things for the team.\"\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"I don't think the players were tired. Maybe in the second half it looked like this was the case, but in the first half we played well.\n\"We controlled the game and had the best chance of the first half. In the second half, we made an error before the first goal and left Riyad Mahrez alone.\n\"Unfortunately we lost our focus and concentration, we were 1-0 down and had to open up, left some spaces, which they used.\n\"I am gutted today because I think there was something in this game for us. In the end we have to say they deserve to win.\"\nMahrez ups output - the stats\nRiyad Mahrez has now been directly involved in 14 goals (seven goals, seven assists) after 22 Premier League games this season; nine more than he had managed after as many games in 2016-17 (three goals, two assists).\nMahrez has both scored and assisted in the same league game for the first time since February 2016 against Manchester City.\nLeicester are now unbeaten in 14 Premier League home games against newly-promoted opposition since losing 5-0 to Bolton Wanderers in August 2001.\nMarc Albrighton now has five assists in his last nine league games for Leicester - this after going 12 games without setting up a team-mate prior to this run.\nIslam Slimani has now had a hand in 10 goals (six goals, four assists) in his 15 league starts for Leicester.\nSlimani's goal was his first from outside the box in a league match since March 2016 for Sporting Lisbon.\nHuddersfield have now failed to find the net in eight of their 11 away fixtures in the Premier League - no side has failed to score more often on the road this season than they have (Brighton and Crystal Palace also on eight).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Fleetwood in the FA Cup third round on Saturday before visiting Chelsea in the Premier League the following weekend.

When asked if he thought he would remain in his position, the Welshman replied: \"Who else is going to do the job?

        "article_text": "Everton 0-2 Manchester United\nManchester United moved back into second place in the Premier League behind Manchester City as they eased to victory over Everton at a subdued Goodison Park.\nUnited manager Jose Mourinho was keen to end a sequence of three draws and they were able to achieve it with the minimum of fuss against Sam Allardyce's toothless hosts.\nAnthony Martial compensated for the absence of Romelu Lukaku and Zlatan Ibrahimovic with a superb curling effort from 20 yards in the 57th minute after former United star Wayne Rooney lost possession.\nEverton barely posed a threat apart from an Oumar Niasse header off target, and United wrapped up a win that reduces Manchester City's lead to 12 points before they play Watford on Tuesday when Jesse Lingard struck a brilliant shot from outside the area beyond Jordan Pickford.\nMourinho criticises Scholes for Pogba comments\nEverton hopeful on \u00a325m striker Tosun\nUnited back on track\nUnited's goals may have been spectacular but this was a largely efficient display settled by an increase in tempo and work-rate at the start of the second half that was more than enough to dispatch a timid Everton.\nMourinho was missing Lukaku, ruled out of a return to Everton after suffering a heavy knock to the head against Southampton, and Ibrahimovic, who has a knee injury, but they were still far too strong for Everton.\nThe United manager has cut a downbeat figure after a winless run of four matches, which included the shock League Cup loss at Bristol City and Premier League draws against Leicester City, Burnley and Southampton.\nThis, however, was an untroubled return to second place in the table apart from a couple of moments of anxiety after Martial put them ahead just before the hour.\nIn a match short on high excitement, it needed moments of magic to add a layer of gloss to a colourless occasion and Martial provided it, along with the prolific Lingard.\nSomething special was required to beat Everton's outstanding goalkeeper Pickford and it duly arrived via the quick feet and precise finish into the top corner from Martial after a neat pass from Paul Pogba, who was again involved later on when the rapidly maturing Lingard added a stylish second.\nUnited's chase of City at the summit is surely forlorn but the battle for the top four looks increasingly competitive, so this was an important victory.\nEverton creatively bankrupt\nEverton manager Allardyce's problems are the same ones Ronald Koeman had before he was sacked in October - a horribly imbalanced squad with weaknesses exposed by the inexplicable failure to replace leading scorer Lukaku after his move to United.\nEverton have ground out grim goalless draws against Chelsea and West Brom while they were spared defeat in the Merseyside derby at Liverpool by Rooney's late penalty.\nAllardyce has addressed defensive weaknesses with his customary zeal but Everton will continue to struggle to score until he can bring in a striker to offer serious threat.\nEverton hope to secure a deal for Besiktas striker Cenk Tosun - and the mounting body of evidence suggests this needs to be done as a matter of urgency.\nNiasse is willing but very limited while Dominic Calvert-Lewin is in need of a rest after taking on such a heavy workload this season.\nEverton's fans demonstrated some impatience when Rooney was replaced by James McCarthy - who briefly made a difference before Lingard settled matters - with jeers from some sections.\nAllardyce's pragmatic approach is being accepted for now, and any criticism must be placed in the context of his lack of potent attacking options, but it is a serious problem he must tackle swiftly.\nMan of the match: Paul Pogba (Man United)\n'We needed to put pressure on and we didn't' - what they said\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce: \"If you gift the ball back to the team like United then they punish you. Here's some analysis for the lads on Match of the Day if you want: For the first goal they back off, back off and back off.\n\"We needed to put pressure on United and we didn't. Martial takes the ball and lifts the shot with no blue shirt trying to close him down or tackle him. We have to avoid unforced errors, cut balls out and have to be consistent or a team like United will punish you.\n\"It's a shame what happened in last five minutes at Bournemouth and today. Up to then a magnificent performance from everybody, but we need to bring a stop to the run of bad results.\"\nUnited just keep on beating Everton - the stats\nThis was Manchester United's 35th Premier League win against Everton - this is more than any other team against any other opponent in the competition.\nAnthony Martial has been directly involved in six goals in his last five appearances against Everton in all competitions (four goals, two assists).\nPaul Pogba has been involved in 10 goals in 12 Premier League games this season (three goals, seven assists) - one more than he was involved in the whole of last season in 30 games.\nSince the start of December, only Harry Kane (eight) has scored more Premier League goals than Jesse Lingard (six).\nOnly Romelu Lukaku (15) has scored more goals for Man Utd in all competitions this season than Jesse Lingard (10).\nJesse Lingard has been involved in 11 Premier League goals this season (seven goals, four assists) and averaged a goal involvement every 84 minutes. Before 2017-18, his average was one every 378 minutes in the Premier League.\nJose Mourinho has lost none of his 12 Premier League meetings with Allardyce (W9 D3 L0) - the manager he's faced the most in the competition without losing.\nOf sides to have played both this season and last season in the competition, Manchester United have conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League since Mourinho was appointed as their manager in the summer of 2016 (45 in 60 games).\nThis is the third time this season that Everton have failed to fire a shot on target in a Premier League match, two of which have come in the last four games (Chelsea & Man Utd).\nWhat's next?\nEverton face Liverpool at Anfield in the FA Cup on Friday at 19:55 GMT, before returning to Premier League action against Tottenham at Wembley on 13 January at 17:30.\nUnited host Derby County in the cup on Friday, kicking off at 20:00. Their next league outing is on 15 January at home to Stoke at 20:00."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 Crystal Palace\nCrystal Palace produced a gutsy second-half display to cancel out Shane Long's first goal in 11 months and leave Southampton 17th in the table.\nLong had given Saints the lead at St Mary's, ending a run of 34 competitive games without a goal, as the home side had the better of the first half.\nBut Palace switched to a 4-4-2 system after the break and profited when James McArthur volleyed in from close range.\nChristian Benteke was arguably offside when he headed into McArthur's path but Palace built on it when Luka Milivojevic smartly curled home the winner from 25 yards.\nThe strike boosted Palace's record to one defeat in 11 games, enough for 14th place in the Premier League.\nSouthampton, in contrast, are nine without a win and slip to 17th, two points adrift of Palace.\nAnalysis and reaction from Tuesday's games\nTime for Saints to spend\nThe mass of empty seats at St Mary's as injury time played out pointed to frustration and only goal difference now keeps Southampton out of the bottom three.\nEarlier in the day the club's chairman Ralph Krueger spoke about last week's \u00a375m sale of Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool, stating the widespread speculation over the defender's future created a \"very difficult phase\" for the club.\nBoss Mauricio Pellegrino said it will take six months to see if letting Van Dijk leave was the correct move and with his side now embroiled in a relegation battle, how the Argentine spends the proceeds will prove critical.\nThe sight of Long ending his run of 1,320 league minutes without a goal with a whipped finish from Jeremy Pied's cross will have provided a brief boost for Pellegrino, whose side have scored just 21 goals in the league this season.\nIt is an area of the pitch which undoubtedly needs attention and aside from a glancing Oriol Romeu header which flashed wide late on, their response to Palace's resurgence screamed of a team floundering and short of ideas.\nFor their 61% possession, the Saints did not create enough. There were moments when full-backs Ryan Bertrand and Pied admirably joined in attacks during the first period but end product remained evasive and after the break the home side took a back step.\nA heavy St Mary's pitch arguably provides some excuse for their lack of quality but will not paper over the fact Pellegrino has now overseen the club's longest run without a win in the top-flight since 2005.\nThe Argentine appears to be facing a crucial transfer window. A goalscorer and added guile appear necessities.\nPalace switch delivers the goods\nSouthampton were the opposition when Roy Hodgson took charge of Palace back in September, with the Eagles rock bottom and pointless.\nThis win was further proof of how he has galvanised the team. Just as they did against Watford in mid-December, they showed the tenacity to come from behind and land three points when appearing to not be fully at the races.\nHodgson had spoken of being \"afraid\" his side had stretched their resources \"to the absolute limit\" before kick-off, having ground out an admirable draw against league leaders Manchester City just 48 hours earlier.\nOn times they did look leggy on a night where they performed 427 sprints to their hosts' 473. But they were simply more efficient in the testing conditions and Hodgson deserves huge credit for shuffling his pack during the match.\nYohan Cabaye - arguably more leggy than any of his team-mates - was withdrawn at the break with Patrick van Aanholt introduced to take up a left-wing berth in a 4-4-2 shape, a switch from the 4-2-3-1 the visitors had started with.\nThe late introduction of Bakary Sako saw him join Benteke up front, moving Wilfried Zaha to left wing and Van Aanholt to left-back.\nFive minutes after Sako's introduction, McArthur turned home as Palace mounted their first sustained spell of pressure and 11 minutes later, Milivojevic beautifully swept home the winner, two days after missing an injury-time penalty to beat Manchester City.\nZaha should have added a third but fired over. But unlike Southampton, Palace will carry a positive momentum into the January transfer window where both clubs will be expected to take steps to bolster their survival hopes.\nMan of the match - Roy Hodgson\nPalace comeback again - the key stats...\nOnly Everton (12) have won more points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than Crystal Palace (11).\nCrystal Palace earned their first top-flight away win against Southampton in 10 attempts, since a 3-2 win at The Dell in November 1990.\nJames McArthur's goal was his fifth in all competitions this season, equalling his best return in a single season in English football (also 2016-17).\nLuka Milivojevic scored his sixth Premier League goal for Crystal Palace, but his first that wasn't from the penalty spot.\nThe Eagles are now unbeaten in five Premier League away games (W2 D3), their longest such run in the competition since February 2015.\n'Difficult to digest' - Manager reaction\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It is a difficult game for us to digest because in the first half it was completely different and we were talking about how to score the second goal, but we gave them the possibility to score a couple of goals because we played backwards and sometimes we played too deep.\n\"My players' confidence will be down but that is normal. We must learn how to play this type of game, especially when the conditions are like that.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"The players deserve enormous credit to get four points from the program that we've had, with such short recovery time. I thought in the first half the pitch was quite heavy and didn't suit the type of football we like to play, but we certainly got over that in second half.\n\"We knew it would be tough for our midfield, Cabaye we know is a magnificent player but we knew it'd be difficult for him to get 90 minutes so at half-time we brought him off and hoped Patrick and Wilfried would lead to more domination in their half. Luckily the changes worked for us and I was happy with how it worked out in the end.\"\nUp next\nSouthampton travel to Championship Fulham in the FA Cup third round on Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Crystal Palace visit Brighton in the competition on Monday (19:45 GMT)."

West Ham had been inactive since 26 December.\n\"If I was Alan Pardew I would be completely disappointed with the way the Premier League has set it up for them,\" said Moyes.\n\"You would not have thought they were the team that played two days ago.\"\nWest Brom have not won any of their eight games since Pardew was appointed at the end of November, and he felt his team were physically and mentally tired at London Stadium.\n\"We had players hanging at the end. They had more energy than us and it showed,\" said Pardew, who had a three-year spell in charge of the Hammers between 2003 and 2006.\n\"Our effort with only a two-day turnaround was amazing. I thought we were tired in mind, which is what you would expect.\"\nBaggies midfielder Jake Livermore was involved in a heated exchange with some home fans when he was substituted in the second half - and West Ham said they would look into the incident.\nAnalysis and reaction from Tuesday's Premier League games\nCarroll gets Hammers upwardly mobile\nDefeat stretches West Brom's winless run to 21 games in all competitions - their last victory a 3-1 defeat of League Two Accrington in the second round of the Carabao Cup on 22 August.\nPrior to that, the Baggies had started the season with back-to-back league victories - and they looked on course for a rare success here when McClean's effort deflected off Angelo Ogbonna and looped over Adrian to put West Brom ahead.\nBaggies goalkeeper Ben Foster helped his side maintain their lead as he saved well from Manuel Lanzini and Marko Arnautovic, but he could not do anything about Carroll's powerful headed equaliser, the striker converting Aaron Cresswell's fine left-wing cross.\nThe visitors had chances of their own to retake the lead as substitute Oliver Burke twice wasted opportunities.\nAnd, with the clock ticking down, Burke gave the ball away with a poor cross, from which West Ham countered. Lanzini played it to Arnautovic and his low cross found Carroll, who converted from a tight angle to give the Hammers the three points and take them above Stoke and Southampton into 16th.\nMan of the match - Andy Carroll (West Ham)\nCarroll on song in January - the stats\nWest Brom are now winless in 20 Premier League games. Only three clubs have had a longer winless run in the competition (Derby 32, Sunderland 26 and Norwich 21).\nCarroll now has eight goals in his past eight Premier League starts in the month of January.\nOnly Joey Barton (five) has assisted more Premier League goals for Carroll than Cresswell (four).\nMcClean has scored three goals against West Ham in the Premier League (seven appearances). He has not scored more than one against any other side in the competition.\nMcClean's opener for West Brom was his first Premier League goal in 472 days - that goal also came against the Hammers.\nArnautovic has now been directly involved in six goals in his past six league games (five goals, one assist). He had been involved in none in his previous 11 before this run.\n'We got the reward for keeping at it' - what they said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes said: \"It was so important as it could have gone either way. The first half was not good, but the second half was much more like it. We got the reward for keeping at it.\n\"Our hopes are not to be in the relegation positions, but we are in there. I am told it is the first time the club has come from behind since we moved to the stadium.\"\nOn Carroll, Moyes added: \"I don't think any centre-half would be able to deal with his jump and header.\n\"The second goal was good play on the break and the ball was played across goal and Andy scores from a tight angle. If he hadn't scored, I would have said he still played well.\"\nWest Brom boss Alan Pardew said: \"It was heartbreaking for the players. It is such a disappointment to concede a goal like that.\n\"We were better in the first half, but we conceded too much possession in the second half and the [two-day] turnaround has done for us.\n\"We were unfortunate to lose Matty Phillips in the warm-up [with a hamstring injury]. I tried to freshen things up, but it was difficult and they had more energy than us.\"\nWhat's next?\nThis was the first of three games in six days for West Ham. The Hammers play at Wembley against Tottenham in the Premier League on Thursday, 4 January (20:00 GMT) before another away match, at League One side Shrewsbury Town, in the FA Cup third round on Sunday. That tie will be broadcast live on BBC One with the programme starting at 13:40 GMT and kick-off at 14:00 GMT.\nAfter two games in three days for West Brom, Pardew's side do not play again until Saturday, with an away tie at League Two Exeter City in the third round of the FA Cup (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham overtook Arsenal as they climbed to fifth place in the Premier League table by defeating bottom side Swansea City at a sodden Liberty Stadium.\nWith Harry Kane left on the bench, his deputy Fernando Llorente headed home against his former club from what appeared to be an offside position to put the dominant visitors ahead.\nHaving initially set out to contain Spurs, Swansea grew in belief in the second half and had chances to equalise, most notably when Mike van der Hoorn's header hit the post.\nBut after surviving spells of home pressure, Spurs launched an 89th-minute counter-attack and Kane found Dele Alli, who had his initial shot saved by Lukasz Fabianski before scoring with the rebound.\nAlli's goal guaranteed Tottenham's third successive league win and inflicted a first defeat for Swansea under new manager Carlos Carvalhal as the Welsh club stayed at the foot of the table, four points adrift of safety.\nSpurs shine but no history for Kane\nTottenham had not played since their 5-2 drubbing of Southampton on Boxing Day and Kane - who scored three of their goals against the Saints after his triple against Burnley - was seeking to become the first player to score three successive hat-tricks in English league football since 1946.\nHowever, the England striker was only named on the bench at the Liberty Stadium, having suffered with a cold in the run-up to the match.\nHis absence did not adversely affect Spurs, and their early supremacy was rewarded with Llorente's glancing header from a Christian Eriksen free-kick.\nThe combination of torrential rain, an unhelpful surface and an ultra-defensive Swansea side had the potential to make this a difficult evening for Mauricio Pochettino's side.\nBut they made light of those factors with an authoritative first-half display, even if they created a relatively short supply of clear scoring opportunities.\nTottenham's grip on the game loosened after the interval and, as Swansea threatened to equalise, Pochettino sought to swing the momentum back in his side's favour with the introduction of Kane.\nThe man who scored 39 goals in 2017 was initially kept busy helping his side to defend but he eventually had his say in attack, lifting a fine cross-field ball to England team-mate Alli, who showed sharp reflexes to score after his first effort was saved.\nSwans aggrieved with officials\nSwansea's manager Carvalhal had enjoyed a fine start to his reign, watching his new players mount a dramatic late comeback to win at Watford on Saturday just two days after the Portuguese was appointed.\nThe Swans attacked with abandon in the closing stages at Vicarage Road but adopted a decidedly more pragmatic approach against Spurs, with Carvalhal switching from his favoured 4-4-2 formation to a defensive system that had five at the back.\nThe same tactic had the desired effect in the reverse fixture in September when, under previous boss Paul Clement, Swansea held Tottenham to a goalless draw at Wembley.\nOn this occasion, however, it was undone after just 12 minutes by their top scorer last season, Llorente, who nodded in from what looked to be an offside position.\nWith simply shackling their opponents no longer enough, Swansea at least showed some attacking intent towards the end of the first half, with Renato Sanches curling a free-kick narrowly over and Martin Olsson shooting wide.\nCarvalhal's side had reason to be aggrieved again in the second half when Tottenham's Davinson Sanchez, who had already been booked, clattered Olsson but was not shown a second yellow card by referee Bobby Madley.\nThose contentious decisions fuelled a fiery atmosphere among the home supporters, and they were given reason to believe their side could force an equaliser as they mustered a flurry of second-half chances.\nJordan Ayew dribbled past Eric Dier and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris but, as he lost his balance with an open goal in view, he was thwarted by a flying block from Spurs' former Swans defender Ben Davies.\nVan der Hoorn headed against the post moments later but, as Swansea took risks in their search for a late equaliser, they were picked off by a clinical Tottenham counter-attack to consign the home side to their 14th defeat from 22 Premier League games this season.\nMan of the Match - Christian Eriksen (Tottenham)\n'I am a happy coach with my team' - what they said\nSwansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal: \"What I've seen is that I have a team with character and quality. They are brave and they fight for the points with discipline. Let's see if we can get one or two players in the market but if not the players we have will be brave and show commitment. I am a happy coach with my team. We can achieve points.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino to MOTD: \"When you don't kill games sometimes you pay and one thing can change everything so we were anxious to score the second. It was late in the game but we felt the happiness and the three points are massive. Now we rest and work in the video room because we have another game so soon.\"\nAlli hits hot form - the stats\nDele Alli has been directly involved in six goals in his last six Premier League games for Spurs (two goals and four assists).\nThis was Swansea's 11th defeat at the hands of Spurs in the Premier League (P14 W0 D3 L11); their most against any opponent in the competition.\nThe Swans have won just one of their last 20 games against 'top six' sides in the Premier League (D4 L15), with that victory coming just under a year ago against Liverpool (3-2 at Anfield).\nMauricio Pochettino's side have scored at least two goals in five of their last six Premier League games (18 overall - an average of three per game).\nSpurs have kept consecutive clean sheets away from home in the Premier League for the first time since September, in what were their first two trips of the 2017/18 campaign.\nFernando Llorente has scored 11 goals in his last 12 Premier League appearances at the Liberty Stadium (10 of those for Swansea).\nSince the start of last season, only Romelu Lukaku (nine) has scored more headed goals than the Spaniard (eight) in the Premier League.\nChristian Eriksen provided the assist for Spurs' opener with what was his 44th for the club in the Premier League - only Mesut Ozil (47) has made more in the competition since Eriksen's debut (September 2013).\nWhat's next?\nSwansea travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup third round on Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Tottenham host West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday (20:00 GMT)"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-1 Watford\nRunaway leaders Manchester City showed no ill-effects from the end of their 18-game Premier League winning run by comfortably beating Watford.\nPlaying two days after the 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace, City took just just 38 seconds to open the scoring as Raheem Sterling slotted home Leroy Sane's cross for the quickest goal in the Premier League this season.\nCity, who are 15 points above second-placed Manchester United, doubled their lead when Kevin de Bruyne's cross was turned into his own net by a sliding Christian Kabasele.\nDe Bruyne, who started the match after recovering quickly from a nasty looking injury against Palace, then had a free-kick tipped on to the bar by Heurelho Gomes.\nCity got the third goal their dominance merited when Sergio Aguero scored from close range after the Watford goalkeeper parried De Bruyne's cross.\nAndre Gray netted a late consolation for Watford, tapping home Andre Carrillo's low cross.\nThe visitors, who remain 10th by virtue of their early season form, have lost 10 of their past 14 games.\nCity look strong with returning players\nCity boss Pep Guardiola said after the game - his team's 10th in a month - that the busy festive period is \"going to kill the players\".\nThe leaders were without striker Gabriel Jesus, who will be out for one to two months after injuring a knee against Palace, but that just meant a start for all-time top scorer Aguero.\nDe Bruyne recovered immediately from his Palace knock to start, while defender John Stones returned from the hamstring injury which had sidelined him for over a month and playmaker David Silva was back after two games out for personal reasons.\nHowever, Guardiola said after the game that Silva might need more time off.\nCity - wanting to make things right after dropping points for only the second time this season - led 2-0 after 13 minutes. They could almost relax at that stage against a team totally out of form.\nSterling's opener was City's third quickest in the Premier League era.\nAguero - who has now scored 10 goals in six games against Watford - would have scored earlier had Kabasele not turned De Bruyne's cross into his own net before it reached the Argentine.\nHe missed a hat-trick of chances from De Bruyne crosses, denied twice by Gomes and heading well wide, before scoring after the goalkeeper's fumble.\nStones also fired a glorious chance well over from six yards, and headed straight at Gomes from the rebound after De Bruyne's free-kick was saved onto the bar.\nWatford's late goal denied them a perfect day, with a run of three consecutive clean sheets coming to an end.\nBut they are now 16 games away from an unbeaten Premier League season, despite Guardiola's insistence it will not happen.\nThe one concern was right-back Kyle Walker walking off holding his groin at the final whistle, and Guardiola said the club would have to \"check it out\".\nWatford struggles continue\nWatford's decline this season coincided with Everton sacking Ronald Koeman. The Toffees wanted Marco Silva to succeed the Dutchman, but the Hornets refused to let him go.\nAnd since Koeman's departure, Watford have only taken 10 points from 13 games.\nA visit to Manchester City was probably not one they would have expected to get something from, but they were basically out of the game within 38 seconds.\nWatford had only touched the ball once - when Richarlison was tackled by Silva - by the time Sterling tapped home.\nThey were well beaten by the time Gray, who earlier forced a save from Ederson, was able to turn home Carrillo's cross.\nThey did rally after the goal, but even the most optimistic Watford fans would have known it was a consolation and not the start of a comeback.\nSilva's unwanted record - match stats\nCity have won their past eight matches against Watford in all competitions, doing so by an aggregate score of 27-4.\nSince he took charge of his first away Premier League match on 22 January, Silva has lost more such games than any other manager (13).\nSterling's goal was City's third-fastest goal in Premier League history, behind Jesus Navas against Spurs in November 2013 (13 seconds) and Geovanni against Wigan in December 2007 (29 seconds).\nUnder Guardiola, only Aguero (49) has scored more City goals in all competitions than Sterling (28).\nAguero has only scored more goals against Newcastle (11) in all competitions for City than he has against Watford (10).\nGray's first five Premier League goals were scored in home games - his seven goals since then have all been scored away from home.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\n'We were too soft' - manager reaction\nWatford boss Marco Silva: \"We did everything in a different way to how we prepared. We were too soft in the first 20 minutes.\n\"Too much respect and some nerves. I told them to compete here. The first thing we need to do is not be scared or nervous.\n\"We had chances. The last 20 minutes we were better. We need to compete for the whole 90 minutes.\n\"Congratulations to Manchester City, what they are doing is amazing. Pep Guardiola is showing he can do his philosophy in the Premier League.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"[The Palace game] was the first time we dropped points in 19 games and you saw the reaction in the first 15 minutes.\n\"In the second half when we could have been more tired and complacent thinking about the result, we were completely the opposite. We played an amazing performance and we scored another goal and we could have scored more.\n\"Our fans were a little bit quiet because maybe they were freezing and maybe because it is our fans and the way we express our happiness but I think our team showed a lot of good things today so it means a lot for us.\"\nWhat's next?\nNeither side are in Premier League action for a week and a half.\nManchester City host Burnley on Saturday (15:00 GMT) in the FA Cup third round and are then at home to Bristol City in the Carabao Cup next Tuesday (19:45 GMT).\nWatford face Bristol City next - in the FA Cup on Saturday."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-2 Chelsea\nHector Bellerin's stunning injury-time strike earned Arsenal a point against Chelsea in one of the most entertaining matches of the Premier League season so far.\nThe two sides shared an incredible 33 chances, with the heroic keeping of Gunners' Petr Cech and Blues' Thibaut Courtois ensuring only four goals were conceded.\nCourtois had made exceptional stops to deny Alexis Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette before he was finally beaten when Jack Wilshere fired high past him in the 63rd minute.\nThe lead only lasted four minutes, Eden Hazard converting from the spot to level after his foot had been caught by Bellerin.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger labelled Anthony Taylor's decision \"farcical\", adding \"you could give 10 penalties like that a game\".\nChelsea must have thought they had secured all three points when Marcos Alonso flicked home substitute Davide Zappacosta's low cross after 84 minutes.\nBut in the second minute of stoppage time, Bellerin produced an exceptional half-volley to earn the Gunners a point.\nThere was more drama seconds from the end when Zappacosta's shot thundered off Cech's crossbar.\nInfuriated Wenger to contest FA charge\nRelive the action from the Emirates Stadium\nMills: Football's no longer a contact sport - 5 live's Football Daily\nStunning strikes earn Gunners point\nIt was error-strewn and exhilarating end to a back-breaking festive period for both sides.\nArsenal, playing their sixth game in 19 days, just had the upper-hand in the opening exchanges.\nSanchez saw a shot come off both posts after a stunning stop from Courtois, before the Belgian pushed away a low strike from Lacazette.\nThe French summer signing was a constant menace to the Blues' defence. He had another low effort come off the heel of Courtois and was denied again when his turn and shot was pushed around the post.\nHowever, it was the unlikely sources of Wilshere and Bellerin - with just two goals between them in all competitions this season at kick-off - who managed to find a way past Courtois.\nWilshere, who had not scored in the top flight since May 2015, gave the Gunners the lead when he smashed home high past the goalkeeper from eight yards.\nAnd with the Gunners staring at defeat, Bellerin, who conceded the penalty, produced a brilliant side-foot half-volley to raise the roof at the Emirates.\nOff-target Morata costs Chelsea\nChelsea had 19 of the 33 chances on goal in the match, with top-scorer Alvaro Morata wasting three one-on-one opportunities.\nHis first should have given Chelsea the lead, but he inexplicably slid the ball well wide. He then beat Rob Holding for pace but his dinked finish drifted over the bar.\nAnd moments after Bellerin scored, the Spaniard was faced with another one-on-one but fired straight at Cech before Zappacosta followed up with a vicious strike that came off the bar.\nCech was brilliant and made two great low saves from Hazard and Alonso before he was beaten by the pair.\nHazard, with another effervescent display, scored the equaliser from the spot after Bellerin caught his foot with his studs.\nAnd then wing-back Alonso scored his third goal in his last five appearance when he swept in after good work from Zappacosta on the right.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\n'Morata has not had luck this period' - reaction\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"I think it is a pity because when you have so many chances to score you must win the game. Instead we are talking about a draw against a good team, but in this game we deserved to win as we created a lot of chances.\n\"We must be disappointed, we had a great chance to win, but we must accept the final result. We win together, we lose together, we draw together.\"\nOn the performance of Morata: \"It is not luck in this period, he has to continue to work and continue to improve. For a striker it is very important to score. It is a pity, he had many chances to score, but I'm very happy with his commitment and effort for the team.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a great football game. That's what you want people to talk about. The media and social networks drive everyone crazy today, but what is important to me is a good football game.\n\"We played three games in six days and you could see the team gave absolutely everything. We have a busy schedule and have made bad decisions but there is still great quality in our games.\"\nWilshere ends 43-game drought - stats\nArsenal have avoided defeat against Chelsea in their two league meetings of the season (drawn two) for the first time since 2011-12.\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte has enjoyed just one victory in his six meetings with the Gunners in all competitions since the start of last season (D3 L2).\nThis game was Wenger's 60th meeting with Chelsea in all competitions - making them the side he has faced the most as Arsenal boss (W22 D17 L21).\nWilshere scored his first goal in his last 43 Premier League games, since netting against West Brom in May 2015.\nEach of the 14 penalties Cech has faced in the Premier League with Arsenal has been scored.\nSince the start of last season, Marcos Alonso has been directly involved in 16 Premier League goals (12 goals, four assists), four more than any other defender.\nHector Bellerin bagged his first goal in his last 22 Premier League games, since netting at the tail-end of last season against Everton.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are at Championship club Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday (16:00 GMT) and face Chelsea again in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg next Wednesday (20:00 GMT). Before that match Chelsea are at Norwich's Carrow Road on Saturday (17:30 GMT) for their FA Cup tie."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 West Ham United\nSon Heung-min and Pedro Obiang scored two stunning long-range strikes as Tottenham drew with West Ham.\nObiang's 35-yard drive into the top corner was the first shot for David Moyes' Hammers at Wembley, with Spurs having had 20 by that stage.\nThe hosts dominated the game - both sides' second Premier League match in 48 hours - but were denied by a series of last-ditch blocks and saves.\nBut Son broke West Ham's resistance with a 30-yard strike beyond Adrian.\nQuestion marks over Pochettino's tactics - Claridge\nRelive the action from Wembley\nWho made your 2017 Premier League XI?\nHammers almost win with defensive masterclass\nWest Ham were without the injured Andy Carroll - who was on the bench - and Marko Arnautovic, so Moyes set his side up not to lose, a target they accomplished and very nearly bettered.\nBy the 70th minute they still had not had a touch in Spurs' penalty area, but then suddenly and entirely against the run of play they found themselves in front thanks to a goal-of-the-season contender.\nManuel Lanzini gave the ball to Obiang, who came in from the left channel and unleashed a thunderous effort past the helpless Hugo Lloris to register only his third goal for the club.\nAfter Spurs levelled through Son's equally sublime strike, West Ham's defensive resolve was summed up in injury time when Victor Wanyama, Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and Son all had shots blocked in the space of 30 seconds.\nSon said after the game that he thought \"Obiang's goal was better\".\n\"The strike was unbelievable,\" he added. \"We have the best goalkeeper in the world and he can't do anything. It was a great strike.\"\nFrustrating night for Spurs\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino will be disappointed with his side's failure to unlock the Hammers' defence and they now sit three points off fourth-placed Liverpool.\nThey had 31 shots - eight on target, 14 blocked - with their only successful effort bypassing West Ham's resolute back five, which at times felt like a back 10.\nErik Lamela fed in-form Son to score a goal not too dissimilar to Obiang's, the South Korean hitting a lovely effort that swerved and faded away from Adrian's grasp.\nHarry Kane, fit to start after only being a substitute as they beat Swansea 2-0 on Tuesday, had a disappointing night in front of goal. He had seven shots, three on target, although he could have had a penalty when Pablo Zabaleta appeared to pull his arm in the area.\nThis season has seen plenty of defensive performances and one-sided games in the Premier League, and Pochettino's side will need to do better next time they face such a tactic.\nMan of the match - Angelo Ogbonna (West Ham)\n'Normally it would be 3-1, 4-1, 5-1' - manager reaction\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We only scored once - and the most difficult chance. I'm very pleased with the effort but very unhappy with the result. We deserved to win but football is like this and we have to accept that.\n\"We had to score and be effective in front of goal. To play and run like that after two games in 48 hours deserves credit.\n\"It was an amazing goal from Obiang, their first shot, it's difficult to accept. Normally we would finish 3-1, 4-1, 5-1 but it wasn't like this.\n\"I didn't see any penalty shouts from my position. I am not going to say anything about the referee, I trust in them.\"\nWest Ham boss David Moyes to BBC Sport: \"To come here and get a point after what we did two days ago [a 2-1 win over West Brom] is a great effort.\n\"We have scored a goal and so have they - they can have as many shots as they like. It was a great finish from Obiang, unexpected. He struck it brilliantly well.\n\"We're miles away from how I want us to play but we are doing some things right. We are defending well which gives us a chance against the top teams. I want the players to look up the table.\n\"We need a lot in the transfer window but if I can get one or two I'll be happy.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live analysis\nFormer Premier League striker Steve Claridge at Wembley:\nMauricio Pochettino didn't do enough to turn that game around. He should have put Fernando Llorente on earlier. It was only when West Ham scored that he made the changes and went more attacking.\nWest Ham were magnificent on the night - spirit, organisation and work-rate - everything David Moyes demanded.\nThe stats don't tell the true story - Spurs may have had 31 shots but created four half chances and one really good one. Spurs didn't really look like opening West Ham up. Their performance belies those stats.\nMatch stats - Kane loses the London derby scoring touch\nIn four London derbies in all competitions under David Moyes, West Ham have managed just three shots on target. However, they've scored two of them, and have lost just once (W1 D2).\nSon Heung-min has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last nine home games for Tottenham in all competition (seven goals, five assists).\nSpurs have never lost a Premier League game on a Thursday (P11 W6 D5 L0) - it is the highest number of games played by a team on a specific day without defeat in the Premier League era.\nHarry Kane has scored just three goals in his last 10 Premier League London derby matches, failing to find the net on eight occasions in that run.\nAfter a run of 13 defeats in 16 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents (W1 D2), West Ham are unbeaten in their last three against them (W1 D2).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host AFC Wimbledon on Sunday (15:00 GMT) in the FA Cup third round, with West Ham at Shrewsbury an hour earlier."

Nothing, only talk about this.\n\"This is one of the situations VAR will in the future say clear penalty - it will be clear.\"\nSwansea have struggled for goals all season but took the lead on the hour when Ayew headed at goal following Van der Hoorn's fine cross from the right flank.\nNewcastle goalkeeper Darlow produced a one-handed save to parry Ayew's first header, but the Ghanaian pounced from the rebound to score his third goal in five league matches.\nSubstitute Bony has only scored twice since rejoining the club for \u00a312m from Manchester City, but had a chance to win it only to see his shot in the 93rd minute hacked off the line by Yedlin.\nRead more: Where was VAR when it was needed?\nBenitez keen for signings to improve wasteful Newcastle\nNewcastle have now only lost once in five Premier League matches as manager Rafael Benitez continues to pick up points, despite the off-field issues as owner Mike Ashley looks to sell the club.\nThe uncertainty has raised questions over whether Newcastle will be able to strengthen their squad in the January transfer window, and this match again highlighted the need for new additions as they battle to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\nDwight Gayle, who started the match, failed to score for the eighth successive game and had three good chances but headed straight at Lukasz Fabianski, headed wide from a second chance and also shot just wide.\nPerez was also denied by Fabianski and Paul Dummett should have done better when he fired over the top from six yards out.\nThose wasted chances hurt Newcastle as Swansea took the lead before Joselu, who replaced the injured Gayle, equalised to give the hosts a point.\nBenitez said it was \"really important\" for him to strengthen the squad this month.\nHe added: \"We are trying to have some good targets and hopefully we can do something before the end. We need quality help.\"\nNewcastle's home struggles continue - the stats\nNewcastle have failed to win any of their past seven home Premier League games (drew two, lost five) - their longest winless run since April 2009 under Joe Kinnear and then Alan Shearer (eight games).\nIndeed, it is Benitez's longest winless run on home soil in the Premier League as manager.\nSwansea have won four points in their two Premier League away games under Carvalhal - as many as they had won in their previous nine in the top flight.\nThe Swans have kept just one clean sheet in their past 10 Premier League games, conceding 20 goals in the process.\nAll four of Joselu's Premier League goals for Newcastle have come on home soil.\nAyew has scored in three of his past five Premier League appearances - after failing to score in his previous 15 in the competition beforehand.\nMan of the match - Jordan Ayew (Swansea)\n'We can't make these mistakes' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez said: \"It's something we have seen in the past, we created enough chances to score in the first half and then we concede. It's always difficult to be happy when you draw at home but the main thing is the reaction and how we were pushing at the end.\n\"We have to learn that every single mistake can cost you and we can't make these mistakes. With the first-half chances we could have changed the game but we couldn't do it and we must take these chances.\n\"We know with a new manger they have confidence and are playing well but the reaction after the goal is the most positive thing. I thought our mobility and pace could cause problems but Dwight got a kick and I'm happy for Joselu to get his goal.\"\nSwansea manager Carlos Carvalhal said: \"I'm very happy, two away games and we get four points - it's not excellent but it is good and against Tottenham we had no points but we played well and deserve more.\n\"This game we prepared really well to play with the ball, I think we had 57% possession but we also tried to move the ball into the spaces to create damage to the defensive organisation of Newcastle.\n\"We corrected at the break and in the second half we controlled the game. I am very happy with the players' commitment, they were very good in these games and we are doing the things we are training on.\n\"When we arrived no-one outside Swansea believed we can stay in the Premier League but I believe when we achieve a draw here playing good football against a good team and especially the second half against Tottenham. People will look and see that these guys are reacting. It's our challenge, we are achieving points in a difficult situation, but we are reacting.\"\nOn whether Swansea would sign anyone in the transfer window, Carvalhal added: \"I believe we will achieve new players soon, hopefully in the next few days and hopefully two or three good players. I am pleased with my players but we have some gaps. My players deserve that we bring in some class players to achieve another level.\"\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle play away at Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday, 20 January (17:30 GMT).\nFor Swansea, they play at home to Championship leaders Wolves in an FA Cup third-round replay on Wednesday, 17 January (19:45 GMT) before playing at home in the Premier League against Liverpool on Monday, 22 January (20:00 GMT)"

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 1-4 West Ham United\nWest Ham manager David Moyes says the board \"want to add more players\" after his side thrashed Huddersfield 4-1.\nThe Scot refused to blame the club's owners for a lack of transfer activity so far in the January transfer window, explaining it was \"just the difficulty of the month\".\nSaturday's win means Moyes is just the fourth manager to win 200 Premier League matches.\nHis side have gone five games unbeaten in all competitions, move five points away from the drop zone and overtake Huddersfield in the process.\nIt was skipper Mark Noble who led the way - pouncing on a lazy pass from goalkeeper Jonas Lossl to put the visitors in front.\nJoe Lolley equalised with a superb curling effort before Marko Arnautovic scored within seconds of the restart.\nHe later assisted Manuel Lanzini twice as the visitors ran away with it in the second half - inflicting just a fourth home defeat on Huddersfield this season.\nDavid Wagner gave league debuts to new signings Terence Kongolo and Alex Pritchard, and said they will \"help Huddersfield reach their target\" of securing Premier League safety.\n\"The two signings we made very much made sense,\" Wagner said. \"I am absolutely happy they are with us.\"\nThe Terriers remain four points above the relegation zone before a trip to Stoke and a home match against Liverpool.\nRelive the match here\nReaction to all the other 3pm kick-offs\nA prolific pair\nArnautovic was forced to miss the 1-1 draw with Tottenham on 4 January but was straight back into the starting line-up at John Smith's Stadium.\nMoyes knew he needed his best players on the pitch and Arnautovic did not let him down - contributing two assists and a goal.\nHe terrorised Huddersfield's defence all afternoon and, despite not making much impact in the first half, there were signs he would become a danger.\nHis link-up play with Lanzini was on show in the opening stages as the pair created space for each other out wide and constantly switched positions.\nThe dynamism and creative flair ultimately opened things up, but it was Arnautovic's determination off the ball that got the early second-half goal as his side regained the lead.\nHe weaved in and out of defenders to create Lanzini's first before the pair linked up again to make it 4-1 and seal the victory.\nArnautovic said his team were \"on fire in the second half\" - but it was his partnership with Lanzini that earned the three points.\nHuddersfield's fortress collapses\nAlthough the defeat does not cause too much damage to their league position, it was one of the heaviest Huddersfield have suffered this season.\nThey have lost at home on four occasions in all competitions - to Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham, who are all competing in the Champions League.\nThat shows what a good result it was for Moyes' side, but also puts into perspective the success Huddersfield have had so far this season.\nTheir performance against West Ham was out of character. They made three key errors which Wagner described as leading to \"own goals\" as the Hammers unpicked them in the second half.\nLossl's weak pass to Lolley in the first half kick-started a string of individual errors and, although Arnautovic was creative in his own right, he was helped immensely by a poor Huddersfield display.\nMoyes in illustrious company\nMoyes' Premier League record puts him behind only Sir Alex Ferguson (528), Arsene Wenger (468) and Harry Redknapp (236), and he said having his name alongside those \"great managers\" was a \"good feeling\".\n\"I'm just glad I have managed to win a few,\" he joked.\nSince being appointed West Ham manager, he has turned things around and the Hammers are now creeping their way slowly up the table.\nThe festive period was a particularly impressive one for Moyes' side. They have picked up eight points from their past five games, including draws against Tottenham and Bournemouth away from home.\nVictory at John Smith's Stadium has given them some distance above the drop zone but they still have a long way to go before securing safety.\nHammers on the up - the best of the stats\nWest Ham have won eight points in their past four Premier League away games (W2 D2 L0), as many as in their previous 15 combined.\nSome 69% of Huddersfield's home goals conceded in the Premier League this season have been against London clubs (11/16).\nHuddersfield have conceded seven goals in their past two Premier League games, this after conceding six across their previous six.\nLanzini scored his first ever double in the Premier League, on what was his 78th appearance in the competition.\nWhat the managers say\nWest Ham manager David Moyes: \"We have a long way to go but the players have done brilliantly well since we came in and they did very well today.\n\"I'm really pleased with Marko Arnautovic. Everybody knew how good he was at Stoke and maybe giving him a freer role up front has given him a chance to express himself.\n\"Andy Carroll wasn't fit. We decided not to bring him to the game because we have a game on Tuesday.\"\nHuddersfield head coach David Wagner: \"It's not about the position in the table - this is a good one - but our performance was below par, especially individually.\n\"The first three goals [for West Ham] were more or less like own goals. We are not able to win a football match in the Premier League by doing that. It is too easy and that is why we lost.\n\"There were things which we cannot do at this level. We made three of those mistakes in one game - hopefully we will make none in the next.\"\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield travel to Stoke in Saturday's 15:00 GMT kick-off while West Ham host Shrewsbury Town on Tuesday in their FA Cup third-round replay (19:45). Moyes' side return to league action on Saturday against Bournemouth (15:00) at home."

        "article_text": "Watford 2-2 Southampton\nAbdoulaye Doucoure bundled home a controversial 90th-minute equaliser as Watford fought back from 2-0 down to draw with Southampton.\nDoucoure used his right hand to divert Troy Deeney's header past Alex McCarthy from close range to snatch a point for the Hornets.\nTwo goals from James Ward-Prowse had given the Saints a 2-0 lead at half-time as they looked to be on course to end a run of nine Premier League games without a win.\nBut Watford came out stronger in the second half, thanks largely to the introduction of Deeney.\nThey pulled a goal back two minutes before the hour mark as Andre Gray headed home after McCarthy turned Daryl Janmaat's shot onto the crossbar.\nDoucoure's late intervention meant the game finished all-square, but Watford have won just once in their past 10 Premier League games.\nThe home side edged an entertaining first quarter of an hour, but fell behind on 20 minutes as Shane Long's pull-back was deflected into the path of Ward-Prowse, who guided the ball into the bottom corner from 12 yards.\nThat turned the match in favour of the visitors, and they deservedly doubled their lead a minute before half-time. After Long's determined run down the left, he fed Dusan Tadic on the edge of the area and the Serb helped it on to Ward-Prowse, who netted past an exposed Heurelho Gomes.\nThe goals took Ward-Prowse's tally to three in his past two games, having failed to score this season before the FA Cup third-round win over Fulham last week.\nRelive the action here\nDoucoure's 'clear handball' denies Saints at the last\nVideo assistant referees (VAR) made their debut in competitive English football this week - during Brighton's FA Cup win over Crystal Palace.\nBut - after three games in which referees have not had to draw an imaginary TV screen in the air with their fingers, then consult replays of controversial incidents - the system is not being trialled in the Premier League.\nHow Southampton must wish it was.\nTelevision replays, available within seconds, showed Doucoure used his hand to provide the decisive touch - BBC Final Score pundit Kevin Kilbane describing it as a \"clear handball\".\n\"He's got his hand up by his head - it's as clear a handball as you're ever likely to see,\" he said. \"It's a disgrace, an absolute disgrace. Southampton desperately needed this win, and they have been robbed. It's really poor.\"\nRead more: Where was VAR when it was needed?\nVAR signals set to be made clearer for fans before use in FA Cup replays\nIt could be argued Watford deserved their point based on their second-half performance, as Deeney showed what they have missed during his four-match suspension.\nPrior to the break, the home side could not contain Long, Tadic and Ward-Prowse, but Deeney's introduction changed the game.\nPressure still on Pellegrino?\nSouthampton's first-half showing did not fit with a team that began the day outside of the relegation zone only on goal difference.\nWatford deserve credit for their fightback but the Saints should have had more about them to avoid such a shift in momentum as they looked to avoid remaining winless in 10 consecutive league games for the first time since January 2005.\nSome of that responsibility lies with manager Mauricio Pellegrino, who failed to react quickly enough to Watford adopting a more attacking formation when Deeney was introduced.\nThe draw lifts Saints up to 16th - ahead of Bournemouth on goal difference before the Cherries face Arsenal on Sunday - but questions remain about the future of Pellegrino.\nDo the club's hierarchy want to put the \u00a375m they received for the sale of defender Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool in his hands? Arsenal winger Theo Walcott and Atletico Madrid playmaker Nicolas Gaitan are said to be targets.\nMan of the match - Shane Long (Southampton)\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"I never see this type of mistake in the Premier League before. To live this injustice is really hard. I think we have to try [VAR] and analyse if it's possible to help the sport to make better decisions, even for the referee.\n\"Football is like this sometimes, small details change everything. We are very sad but we have to accept the rules. It's part of football. Even in the second half they were playing more direct, I don't remember many clear chances, just second balls. They are stronger than us in this physical battle.\n\"The last four games the team is growing. Playing in this way it's easy for everybody because I'm sure we'll win games.\"\nWatford manager Marco Silva to Sky Sports: \"I have a different opinion. I talk about the match, two different halves.\n\"I don't need to talk about the goal. Something can happen and this season we've had decisions go against us. I understand Southampton are unhappy like I was not one time, more than one time when the mistake is against us. It can happen.\"\nMatch stats - Fighting Hornets\nThe Hornets have recovered eight points from losing positions at Vicarage Road in the Premier League this season - only Everton (9) have rescued more at home.\nWatford have conceded 25 goals at Vicarage Road in the Premier League this season - the most of any side in home games.\nWard-Prowse scored his first double in the Premier League since January 2016 (v West Brom), which was his only previous one in the competition.\nTadic recorded his 27th Premier League assist for Southampton - only Matt le Tissier (64) has made more for the Saints in the competition.\nSouthampton conceded their 1,000th goal in the Premier League - becoming the seventh team in competition history to do so.\nGray scored his first goal for Watford at Vicarage Road, in what is his 12th appearance there in all competitions for the Hornets.\nDoucoure has scored more goals (seven) and more home goals (four) than any other Watford player in the Premier League this season.\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to Leicester City on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Southampton have an extra day to prepare for the visit of Tottenham (16:00 GMT).\nThe pair will meet again later this month in the fourth round of the FA Cup, this time at St Mary's on 27 January (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-0 Leicester City\nLeicester boss Claude Puel said the decision to send off Ben Chilwell at Chelsea was \"harsh\" as his side drew a match they probably should have won.\nThe Foxes dominated possession for large periods and created the better chances but had the sting taken out of their display when defender Chilwell was shown two yellow cards in the space of five second-half minutes.\nHe was shown no mercy by referee Mike Jones in the 68th minute when he brought down Victor Moses, shortly after fouling Willian.\n\"At the end the feeling is mixed,\" said Frenchman Puel. \"A good point, against 11 at the end.\n\"The red card was harsh. The two yellow cards - it is not balanced. It's difficult to accept, but the point makes it a little bit OK.\"\nThe Foxes went close twice through Jamie Vardy, while Wilfred Ndidi's header was acrobatically pushed away by Thibaut Courtois.\nChelsea looked leggy and short of ideas. Cesc Fabregas had two good efforts - twice testing Kasper Schmeichel - and seconds from the end the Danish keeper pushed away a free-kick from Marcos Alonso.\nThe Blues are now level on points with second-placed Manchester United, who host Stoke on Monday.\nLeicester have 31 points and remain in eighth.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge\nFoxes' good work undone by Chilwell red\nIt was the generally more timid of the two managers who got their side to play the more exhilarating football at Stamford Bridge.\nPuel's side harried the Blues from the first whistle, and should have scored at least once from one of their three chances in the 10th minute.\nEngland striker Vardy, fit again after a groin problem, found the side-netting and fired just wide, while Shinji Okazaki also missed narrowly after more initial good work by Vardy.\nRiyad Mahrez has been the subject of rumours linking him to Liverpool and Arsenal, but today his mind was clearly on the matter in hand. He was exceptional in midfield and found Vardy twice with exquisite passes, only for the striker to miss the target with one strike and have another blocked by Gary Cahill.\nLeicester's best chance of the match fell to Ndidi, whose instinctive header was brilliantly pushed away - one-handed - by Courtois.\nThe Foxes looked set to turn the screw midway through the second half, but had to change their gameplan when England Under-21 defender Chilwell was sent off for a second bookable offence.\nNevertheless, the defence continued to look comfortable against a Chelsea attack bereft of ideas. The only time Schmeichel was severely tested was moments before the final whistle, when he tipped Alonso's low free-kick around the post.\nTired-looking Blues deliver lacklustre performance\nDid fatigue play a part in Chelsea's dispirited display? Or did manager Antonio Conte's suggestion he might not be at Stamford Bridge next season have anything to do with it?\nThis was Chelsea's seventh game in 21 days and they looked like a side sapped of energy.\nStriker Alvaro Morata, who had a great first half to the season with 13 goals from 26 matches in all competitions, has not found the net in his past five and did not have one effort against the Foxes.\nWing-backs Alonso and Victor Moses barely troubled the opposition full-backs, while playmakers Fabregas and Eden Hazard were both replaced only 13 minutes into the second half.\nBar two good saves to deny Fabregas, there was no need for heroics from Schmeichel until the final seconds.\nThis looked an excellent chance for Chelsea to regain second place. Now Conte's side have to pick themselves up for another four games in 14 days.\nMan of the match - Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester)\n'We are not creating chances' - the reaction\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: \"I think we played with a lot of top players against Arsenal, and then again today against a very good team. I think a lot of our players were tired.\n\"In the first half Leicester ran more than us, they played better than us. But we knew we were playing against a good opponent, maybe the worst opponent we could have played in this moment. We suffered a lot in the first half.\"\nOn Alvaro Morata: \"I don't think it is only Morata's problem, also the other players. We are not scoring goals, we are not conceding, but we are not creating chances.\nOn injury to Gary Cahill (who came off in the 33rd minute): \"I think he is with the doctor now, but it's OK. I do not think it was serious.\"\nLeicester boss Claude Puel on Riyad Mahrez's future at Leicester: \"We can see from today he is enjoying his football, he is happy in playing, in training, he is happy with us and his team-mates. There is a lot of speculation about the players, but of course we are happy with him, and we want to keep our best player.\"\nFoxes see red again - the stats\nChelsea have drawn three consecutive games 0-0 in all competitions for the first time in their history.\nLeicester had 12 shots in the first half - the most of any visiting team in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge since 2003-04. However, they managed just two shots after the interval.\nChelsea had seven shots on target in this match - only twice since 2003-04 have they had more in a Premier League home game in which they failed to score (nine v Newcastle in November 2008 and West Ham in January 2014).\nThe Foxes have kept consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since May 2017.\nOnly Watford (four) have been shown more red cards than Leicester (three) in the Premier League this season.\nLeicester were shown the last Premier League red card of 2017, and the first of 2018.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea face an FA Cup replay at home to Norwich on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) and the Foxes also have an FA Cup replay, against Fleetwood Town, 24 hours earlier."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-0 Burnley\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says his side are still \"looking to survive\" despite Bakary Sako's winner against Burnley at Selhurst Park moving them five points above the Premier League relegation zone.\nSako cut in powerfully from the left following good work by Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke, before drilling a left-footed shot that went straight through Clarets goalkeeper Nick Pope for his second goal in as many games.\nHodgson accepted Palace could \"look at the league table for a week or two\", but when pressed on whether he was looking up after beating the seventh-placed Clarets, he said: \"No. We are looking to survive.\"\nHodgson, whose side have lost just once in their past 12 league games, added: \"We will be delighted if at the end of the season we are a point above the relegation zone. We will never waver from that.\"\nRelive Crystal Palace's win over Burnley as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nPalace had chances to make their margin of victory bigger - Ben Mee clearing from under his own crossbar, with James McArthur lurking, after Zaha hooked the ball over Pope.\nBenteke wasted a third Palace chance in quick succession when heading narrowly over from Luka Milivojevic's corner, before Ashley Barnes saw his shot the edge of the area tipped over by Wayne Hennessey at the other end.\nThe visitors introduced new loan signing Georges-Kevin Nkoudou in search of an equaliser, but the second half lacked the attacking quality of the first, as Sam Vokes and then Benteke put efforts into the side-netting.\nTempers flared late on when Charlie Taylor sent Zaha tumbling into a pitchside television camera and cameramen, but calm was restored, and referee Michael Oliver deemed a booking for Taylor was punishment enough.\nPalace lay down a marker\nPalace's previous meeting with Burnley brought about the end of Hodgson's predecessor, Frank de Boer, so this was a real marker for their progress under the former England boss.\nUnder the 70-year-old's stewardship, the south London club have taken 25 points from 19 games. They had none - and had not even scored a goal - in their first seven matches.\nAfter the reverse fixture, Palace chairman Steve Parish caused a stir by asking his Twitter followers: \"Who has the better squad, us or Burnley?\". On the evidence of this match, it was clearly the former.\nThey hustled Burnley and looked the more likely to score the game's second goal, with Zaha's passing carving open Sean Dyche's side on a number of occasions and Timothy Fosu-Mensah delivering in both defence and attack.\nAnd this from a side who started the match without eight first-team regulars, including Jeffrey Schlupp, Andros Townsend, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mamadou Sakho.\nHas Burnley's bubble burst?\nLast Saturday's FA Cup exit at the hands of Manchester City was a rare humbling for Dyche's Burnley this season.\nThe manager will have wanted a response from his side, and should feel they gave him one despite being unable to take advantage of what few chances they did create.\nHowever, that cup exit combined with a run of six league games without a win, has seen hopes of keeping pace with the top six dwindle over the past month.\nIt is a mark of Burnley's performances this season that their winless run is such a talking point but, though they remain seventh, they have lost their first three competitive matches of a calendar year for the first time since 1987 - and have a meeting with Manchester United at Turf Moor next.\nDyche said he was \"not concerned\" by their latest defeat, but more of a worry - and surely something that is in the minds of future opponents - is the fact the Clarets are now winless in all 49 Premier League matches under Dyche when they have conceded the opening goal, losing 40 of those.\n'We're looking up - for now' - what they said\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"It was a massive three points. We knew it would be very, very tough.\n\"We knew they would get stronger and more questions would be asked of our back four and goalkeeper. I'm delighted we were able to withstand that test. They are very good at what they do - a strong team, a physical team.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"I think overall we deserved something from the game - a draw really. It was a bit of a ding dong - them better in the first half, us in the second.\n\"It is a fact we are six without a win. We are Burnley Football Club, we are progressing. We won three out of four just before that. If you mix it up over the season we are moving forward. You have to be the right side of the margins and we just haven't been this month.\"\nPass master Hennessey? - the stats\nCrystal Palace's victory was their 50th at home in the Premier League.\nThe Eagles have now kept consecutive home clean sheets in the Premier League - having had just one in their previous 14 at Selhurst Park.\nSako has scored more goals in all competitions than any other Crystal Palace player, with his strike on Saturday being his sixth of the season.\nGoalkeeper Wayne Hennessey made more passes than any other Crystal Palace player in the match (36).\nOnly Southampton (10) are on a longer winless run in the Premier League than Burnley (six).\nMan of the match - Bakary Sako (Crystal Palace)\nWhat's next?\nPalace will swap south London for north London in their next Premier League fixture, as they travel to Arsenal on Saturday, 20 January (15:00 GMT). Burnley host Manchester United at Turf Moor at the same time."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion\nWest Brom ended a 20-match winless streak in the Premier League with victory over Brighton, thanks to goals from defenders Jonny Evans and Craig Dawson.\nThe unmarked Evans put the Baggies ahead early on when he arrived at the back post to head in Jay Rodriguez's flick-on from a Matt Phillips corner.\nThe hosts added a second from another corner shortly after half-time when Dawson beat Gaeten Bong to Chris Brunt's outswinger to head home powerfully.\nThe victory was Alan Pardew's first in the league since he replaced Tony Pulis in charge at The Hawthorns at the end of November.\nThe only negative for the Baggies was an allegation made by Bong after a gesture from Rodriguez which will be included in the referee's report to the Football Association.\nAfter an argument with Bong, Rodriguez pinched his own nose, prompting an angry reaction from the Brighton defender.\nReferee Martin Atkinson did not take any action on the pitch but made a note of the incident and consulted fourth official Tony Harrington.\nBrighton only fleetingly threatened the West Brom goal as they made it six away league games without a goal.\nJose Izquierdo curled wide from the edge of the area in the first half, and Anthony Knockaert lifted a shot over after a well-worked move.\nThe Seagulls slip from 12th to 15th spot while West Brom remain in the relegation zone in 18th place, but are only two points behind 17th-placed Bournemouth.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nBaggies taste victory - at last\nPardew earned his first win since succeeding Pulis when his side beat Exeter City in the FA Cup last weekend - although only 363 Baggies fans were there to see it.\nThere were many more present in the 25,240 crowd at The Hawthorns and a huge roar greeted the final whistle as Pardew celebrated a first league win.\nIt was a richly deserved three points as West Brom played the more positive attacking football and were defiant in defence against a side who will also be battling to avoid the drop.\nTowards the end of the match Pardew had acted like a cheerleader, whipping up the home fans to give his players the energy to get over the line.\nWith back-to-back wins, in the cup and here, the Albion boss will feel there is finally some momentum building for his side following such a long run.\nBut if West Brom are to avoid relegation to the Championship, this must be a turning point in their season.\nEvans essential to survival bid\nWest Brom captain Evans opened the scoring but it was the 29-year-old's influential defensive display that was of a greater significance.\nAt the heart of the home defence, Evans gave a commanding performance as he marshalled the backline with a calm assurance.\nThe former Manchester United defender continues to be linked with a move to either Manchester City or Arsenal.\nBut a defiant \"come on\" roared by Evans after he scored gave a glimpse of the emotional attachment the Albion skipper has to his current club.\nPardew must do everything in his powers to persuade Evans to remain in the Black Country - West Brom's Premier League status may depend on it.\nFamiliar tale for Brighton on the road\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton has seen his side win only one of their past 12 games and it was familiar problems that cost them.\nThe Seagulls have struggled to defend set-pieces this season and twice they were punished for lapses in concentration.\nWest Brom's early goal, in particular, was costly as Hughton's plan to keep the game tight and pack midfield was ripped up.\nAt the other end of the pitch Brighton struggled for cutting edge in attack and the majority of their attempts were from long distance.\nUndoubtedly the Seagulls' hopes of survival will largely depend on their home form.\nBut Hughton's side must be more solid at the back and clinical up front away from the Amex Stadium.\n'We got our rewards' - reaction\nWest Brom boss Alan Pardew: \"I have waited a long time to win a Premier League game here. We kept doing the right things and got our rewards.\n\"The players have responded well since we got in. We are a big side and good at set-plays but maybe lost that. So we focused on that this week.\n\"They were two well-executed goals from corners. We were also good in terms of stopping them playing.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"It is hugely disappointing because there was not a lot between the two teams.\n\"We have worked hard on defending set-plays and the first goal really hurt us. If they don't get that early goal we are really in it.\n\"We got into a lot of good areas but haven't worked the goalkeeper enough. We have to be more productive in the final third.\"\nMan of the match - Grzegorz Krychowiak (West Brom)\nPardew continues record against Hughton - the stats\nPardew picked up his first Premier League win in charge of West Brom, in what was the Baggies' first win in the competition by more than one goal since March 2017 (3-1 v Arsenal).\nThe Seagulls have won just one of their past 12 games in the Premier League (D5 L6), failing to score at all in eight of these fixtures.\nHughton has not won any of his five games against teams managed by Pardew in the Premier League (D2 L3), managing just one goal across those meetings.\nExcluding penalties, Brighton have conceded more goals from set-pieces than any other team in the Premier League this season (16).\nEach of West Brom's four goals at The Hawthorns under Pardew have come from set-pieces (three from corners and one from the penalty spot).\nEvans netted his second league goal of the season - only once previously has he scored more in a Premier League campaign (three in 2012-13 for Manchester United).\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom face the first instalment of back-to-back away to trips to Merseyside when they face Everton at Goodison Park next Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nBrighton return to home comforts when they host Premier League champions Chelsea in the day's early kick-off (12:30) at the Amex."

In this way he will break all the records in the Premier League.\"\nAllardyce condemns 'unprofessional' Everton\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nRelive Tottenham's victory over Everton\nKane continues remarkable season\nEngland striker Kane has now scored 20 times in the Premier League this season, three more than any other player, and has hit 28 club goals in 28 appearances in all competitions.\nThere was a touch of good fortune about his first, which put Tottenham 2-0 ahead, as he appeared to be in an offside position when he converted Son's pass, but the goal was given.\nThat was his 97th Premier League goal - and his 98th came only 12 minutes later as he scuffed a shot into the net from Dier's cross.\nThe 24-year-old is yet to win any trophies but has already secured his place in the club's record books by overtaking Sheringham, whose goals came during two spells - from 1992-1997 and 2001-2003.\nKane's goals have come in only 135 games, while Sheringham took 237.\nBut, while he now holds the club's Premier League record, he has a long way to go to overtake Spurs' all-time top goalscorer Jimmy Greaves, who netted 266 times in 379 matches, including 220 league goals.\nSon also praised Kane as \"one of the best strikers in the world\". \"I'm a big fan of Harry,\" he added in an interview with the BBC.\n\"I may be older than Harry but I am learning from him the whole time.\"\nTottenham's team goal\nEverton on the slide\nFor Everton, this defeat continues a worrying run of form - they have failed to win any of their past six matches, including defeats in their past four games.\nManager Sam Allardyce handed a debut to Turkey striker Cenk Tosun after his \u00a327m move from Besiktas, but the Toffees failed to register a single shot on target and Tosun was substituted after 62 minutes.\nHaving finished seventh and qualified for Europe last season, Everton had hopes of breaking into the top six in 2017-18, but a poor start under Ronald Koeman and a disastrous run under caretaker manager David Unsworth had left the club worrying about their Premier League future.\nAllardyce took 10 points from his first four league matches in charge, but Everton have added just two more in their five matches since and are only seven points better off than 18th-placed Stoke.\nRooney thought he had headed Everton ahead in the first half after Tosun's flick-on but it was ruled out, and their failure to create any more noteworthy chances shows just how much Allardyce has to do.\nAllardyce, who has been linked with a move for Arsenal forward Theo Walcott, says he is still looking to strengthen his team during the January transfer window.\n\"We haven't got a lot of pace in the side,\" said Allardyce. \"We got a new player on the pitch that's never played in the Premier league.\n\"He'll find out what it's all about physically and mentally and hopefully his goalscoring ability will help us.\"\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\nEverton draw a blank - the stats\nThis was Tottenham's biggest margin of victory in a game against Everton since a 10-4 win in October 1958.\nThe result was also Allardyce's 19th Premier League defeat by four or more goals - the most of any manager in the competition.\nSon became only the second player to score in five consecutive home Premier League matches for Spurs, after Jermain Defoe in 2004.\nAlli has provided seven assists in his 22 Premier League games this season, matching his tally from 37 league games in 2016-17.\nEverton failed to record a shot on target for the fourth time in a Premier League match this season - no side has failed to do so in more games (Swansea also four).\n'We threw in the towel' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"It was a massive performance. Fantastic. I am so pleased. Congratulations to our players because the effort was fantastic.\n\"The three points are important because the top four is so tough. The performance was very good, the players showed great character. I don't think we conceded a shot on target.\n\"Son is doing fantastic in the last two or three months - his belief and confidence is amazing.\"\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce said: \"I think the defining moment in the game was we thought the second goal was offside, probably the same with Wayne's.\n\"When the second goal went in and if it was offside it was a killer, but that doesn't allow us to throw the towel in and relinquish that defensive responsibility.\n\"Too many of our players decided not to defend any more when Tottenham had the ball. I'm hugely disappointed in the professionalism of my players. It's out of order.\n\"Play your way back into the game and be professional about it. It shocked me. I haven't seen it since I got here. I've got to cut it out, starting tomorrow.\n\"It's down to hard work. Tottenham can beat anybody by a lot of goals but they should have had to work a lot harder than they did. We keep foregoing the clean sheet to try and get a result and not getting a result.\n\"We need to go back to basics.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton look to get back into form on Saturday, 20 January with a home game against 19th-placed West Brom (15:00 GMT).

Overall we have to look at it in a very objective and harsh way - we made mistakes we should not have made.\n\"The team that fights against relegation will fight and you cannot afford any concentration mistake.\n\"One-all was not good enough for us.

In total he played more passes (74) and had more touches (98) than any other player.\nBut, for all his commanding presence, and the delicate probing of Iwobi on the right of midfield, it was in attack that Arsenal fell down, managing only three shots on target.\nAlexandre Lacazette led the line, contributing to two good goalscoring opportunities when Maitland-Niles hit the bar and Begovic saved from Danny Welbeck, but the \u00a346.5m striker did not manage a single shot himself.\nWelbeck behind him could contribute only the effort that Begovic smothered.\nWenger, who is being linked with Bordeaux's Brazilian forward Malcom, will know he must replace Sanchez this month once his departure is confirmed.\nHowe's men show their mettle\nSometimes considered a disciple of possession football who only knows one way to play, Cherries boss Eddie Howe continues to suggest there is more subtlety to him.\nBy selecting a back three and two wing-backs, with captain Simon Francis returning in the middle of the defence, Howe gave his team a robust shape and largely nullified the visitors.\nFormer Chelsea player Nathan Ake continues to impress, with four tackles and eight clearances, more than any other defender, and Francis weighed in with six clearances.\nFrancis - for whom attacker Benik Afobe made way - had a big influence, winning 70% of his duels and more headers than anyone.\nBut a more defensive shape than usual, and 18% less possession overall than the visitors, did not stymie the Cherries as an attacking unit.\nIn the first half Ryan Fraser's goalbound shot was blocked by Calum Chambers, and the hosts were denied a possible penalty when referee Kevin Friend did not punish an apparent handball from Iwobi as he defended a corner.\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson (Bournemouth)\n'We paid for our many mistakes' - what they said\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"A huge win for us. Every win in the Premier League is important. It was a tight game, not a lot in it, but we showed the spirit and desire to come back from a losing position.\n\"I am delighted with the attitude of the players. Our fitness levels were very good - statistically we are one of the fitter teams in the division.\n\"If you can get two or three wins your whole outlook can change, then if you get two or three defeats it all changes.

The first reaction was a thrilling one.\nCoutinho has been central to Liverpool's potent attacking style both as a scorer and creator of goals, but Klopp's other game-changers stepped forward to suggest, on initial viewing at least, they can compensate for his departure.\nOxlade-Chamberlain now has a greater opportunity to make his mark, and he delivered after only nine minutes when he arrowed a low, unerring finish past Ederson's outstretched right hand in front of the Kop.\nFirmino harassed Stones into a decisive error before calmly restoring Liverpool's lead at 2-1, while Mane's explosive rising drive and Salah's composure following Ederson's poor clearance illustrated the weaponry at Klopp's disposal.\nThis was all backed up by relentless pressing and harassing in midfield from players such as Emre Can, while Andrew Robertson subdued Raheem Sterling as he produced his best performance since his \u00a38m summer move from Hull City.\nApart from Loris Karius' poor attempt to save from Sane at his near post, compounding Joe Gomez's mistake, this was an outstanding Liverpool performance until their late wobble.\nAs a taste of life post-Coutinho, it was highly satisfying for Klopp and Liverpool.\nNo panic for Guardiola and City\nNo invincibles; the unbeaten record over after 22 games. It all added up to the worst 90 minutes of the season for Guardiola and City.\nLiverpool deserved their victory as City once again tasted defeat on a ground at which they have not won in 18 games stretching back to May 2003.\nWhen the dust settles, however, City can look back at a truly magnificent campaign so far - and, more significantly, a lead that still looks unassailable.\nCity responded serenely to going behind early on, calmly playing their way back into contention until Sane put them back on level terms.\nBut Stones' weak defending broke them and there was no comeback from those goals from Firmino and Mane either side of the hour mark.\nIt was a day when individual errors, such as those by Stones and Ederson, were punished and City simply could not summon up another of those late shows that have brought them so many points this season.\nEven then, when not at their best, they gave Anfield a collective attack of nerves in those closing moments when the possibility of an escape suddenly presented itself.\nIt was a demonstration of the character in Guardiola's side that they kept going - but, in the end, they finally had to taste defeat.\nMiserable Anfield return for Sterling\nSterling has been regarded as the villain in these parts ever since he left Liverpool for City in a \u00a349m deal in July 2015.\nThe ill-feeling towards the forward, who has been one of the Premier League's standout players this season, was demonstrated by the raucous jeers that followed every intervention in this game.\nThere was no lack of effort from Sterling but little went right as he lost his battle with Liverpool left-back Robertson, who was outstanding.\nA historic game - what the managers said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: \"You can watch it as a manager or as a football fan and I prefer to do that - wow! What a game. Two teams, full throttle.\n\"This was a historic game you will talk about in 20 years because it looks like City will not lose another one this year.\n\"People watched this game all over the world and this is why - take your heart, throw it on the pitch and play like this, both teams.\n\"I was not scared at the end, not that I didn't think we could concede a fourth, I have known my boys long enough now, it was so intense.\n\"If you combine quality with attitude you see a game like this. I really loved it.\n\"You will find someone who wants to talk about defending, no clean sheet, but he can blow up my boots.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola to Sky Sports: \"Congratulations to Liverpool for the victory. The game was in our hands at 1-1 but our finishing was not good and then it went suddenly to 4-1. You have to be stable when you concede a goal and we were not solid enough. You have to live this kind of situation in the season.\n\"The reality is we lose the game, we have a week to recover and prepare for the Newcastle game. All credit to the opponent, we know how difficult it is against a Jurgen Klopp team, so aggressive, at Anfield too. We did a good performance apart from a few minutes.\n\"After the second goal they scored two in a few minutes and it is hard to recover from that. In every press conference for the last few months you have said that the Premier League is done and I always said no. It is still to be done. We will defend our position game by game.\"\nMan of the match - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool)\nKlopp extends record over Guardiola - the stats that matter\nGuardiola has lost five matches against Klopp, more than against any other manager.\nCity's run of 22 matches unbeaten from the start of the season can be bettered by only two teams in Premier League history - Arsenal in 2003-04 (38 games) and Manchester United in 2010-11 (24).\nCity have conceded four goals in their past two away Premier League away matches in January, both of which have been on Merseyside (4-0 v Everton, 4-1 v Liverpool).\nLiverpool have scored 85 goals in all competitions this season, just seven shy of the tally they managed in the whole of last season (92).\nSane has had a hand in 16 Premier League goals this season (seven goals and nine assists), exactly double the number he was involved in last season.\nFirmino has now had a hand in six goals in six Premier League games against Manchester City (three goals, three assists), scoring and assisting in three of those games.\nSalah has scored 24 goals and assisted another seven in 30 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions this season.\nThis was City's first 4-3 defeat in the Premier League since they lost to Manchester United by that scoreline in September 2009.\nWhat's next?\nThe visit of Newcastle to Etihad Stadium on Saturday, 20 January (17:30 GMT) is next up for City, while Liverpool have to wait two more days to make the trip to Swansea (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-0 Stoke City\nA Paul Pogba-inspired Manchester United cruised to victory as incoming Stoke boss Paul Lambert watched his new side's struggles continue at Old Trafford.\nThe France midfielder created first-half goals for Antonio Valencia and Anthony Martial, added to by Romelu Lukaku after the break as Jose Mourinho's men cut Manchester City's lead at the top of the Premier League to 12 points.\nUnited might have had an early penalty when Martial was felled by Stoke debutant Moritz Bauer, but referee Anthony Taylor waved away protests.\nTwo minutes later, Pogba charged forward and found Valencia, who cut inside Josh Tymon and fired into the top corner with his left foot.\nMartial collected Pogba's pass and bent a superb finish past goalkeeper Jack Butland from 20 yards for the second - before Lukaku rifled home the third late in the game.\nStoke did create several chances. Midfielder Stephen Ireland - starting his first game since April 2015 - should have scored from 12 yards but fired wide, and goalkeeper David de Gea made excellent stops to deny Xherdan Shaqiri and substitute Mame Biram Diouf.\nThe Potters, beaten by three or more goals for the seventh time this season, remain in the relegation zone, a point adrift of fourth-bottom Southampton.\nIt might have been worse but for the reactions of England international Butland, who prevented United substitute Marcus Rashford from adding a fourth goal.\nRelive the action from Old Trafford\nPredictions: How did Lawro get on against NBA stars Dario Saric & Aron Baynes\nListen to BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nWhere would Sanchez fit in for United?\nManchester United rarely had to get out of second gear in the drizzle at Old Trafford.\nHowever, they were clinical in front of goal, scoring twice from three first-half shots on target against the top flight's worst defence.\nBut one question in the United dressing room, and in the stands, afterwards could have been: where will Alexis Sanchez fit in if his signing is confirmed?\nUnited are favourites to recruit the Chile forward - who has scored 80 goals for Arsenal since 2014 - after Manchester City decided not to pursue their interest in the 29-year-old.\nIf the current occupants of United's attacking sports are concerned, their reply was telling.\nMartial scored and assisted, while Lukaku, on his return from injury, shook off some poor touches earlier in the game to turn strongly past two defenders and fire low and hard past Butland late on.\nJuan Mata went close before being replaced near the end, and Jesse Lingard's quick movement won United four free-kicks.\nMourinho has often experimented with his attacking options this season, and it is Sanchez's versatility - along with his big-game credentials - which is likely to be at the forefront of the Portuguese manager's thinking.\nSanchez can operate on either flank, lead the line or drop into the number 10 role - so no individual appears most at risk of losing their place.\nWith United still competing on three fronts - Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League - he would add experience to a young attacking unit with potential to continue improving.\nLambert learns size of task\nLambert, who was watching from the directors' box, is the man charged with leading Stoke's fight for survival after being appointed earlier on Monday.\nThe 48-year-old Scot, who has been out of work since leaving Wolves at the end of last season, signed a two-and-a-half-year deal to replace the sacked Mark Hughes.\nHis appointment comes after Stoke, in 18th place, failed to land any of their top three targets - Quique Sanchez Flores, Gary Rowett and Martin O'Neill.\nBut Lambert was made to feel welcome by the away end, who chanted his name throughout as he mulled over the scale of the task at hand.\nFor starters, he must solve Stoke's defensive woes. They have now conceded 50 league goals this season - more than any other team in Europe's 'big five' divisions.\nThe return of centre-back and captain Ryan Shawcross - missing again with a calf injury - will help, but Lambert must instil more organisation into a defensive unit cut open too easily by Valencia and which failed to mark Martial.\nHe may be enthused by the debut of Austrian right-back Moritz Bauer, who certainly seems up for the fight and made 75 sprints, more than any team-mate, on a hard-running introduction to English football.\nFor an hour Stoke were not out-played, but Lambert must also add pace in the final third. They have passing quality in midfield but precious little speed to truly unsettle defences.\nHe may consider persevering with the returning Ireland, who can perhaps be forgiven for those missed chances given his inaction. He still made 51 passes, second only to Darren Fletcher, and showed a knack for finding space that could prove useful.\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\n'Organisation is massive' - what they said\nStoke coach Eddie Niedzwiecki to BBC Sport: \"You need to be clinical at places like this and we had our chances and didn't take them.\n\"We have not been able to start a consistent back four or five all season, organisation is massive in this game. The goals were special today that beat us. We need a foundation.\n\"Paul Lambert said a few words to the players in the hotel before the game but he showed me the respect and it was my team today.\n\"I enjoyed the experience but it has been incredibly difficult personally. I will find out my future in the next 48 hours. I know how the game works.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho to BBC Sport: \"Stoke bought players to play football. They were not afraid to play and they created us problems in the first half.\n\"I didn't watch Liverpool beat Manchester City [on Sunday]. It doesn't change anything - the distance is an important distance.\n\"I have been there before. They have their destiny in their hands.\"\nPotters defensive record ominous - the stats\nLukaku has had a hand in 13 goals in 16 appearances for United at Old Trafford this season (10 goals, three assists).\nManchester United have won 28 out of a possible 30 points in Premier League home games against Stoke.\nStoke have conceded 50 Premier League goals this season - five of the previous six sides who had conceded 50 or more goals at this stage of the season were relegated.\nValencia has scored three Premier League goals for United this season, as many as in his previous four seasons combined.\nPogba has been directly involved in 14 goals in his past 14 Premier League games (four goals, 10 assists).\nMartial has scored in all three of his league appearances against Stoke at Old Trafford.\nIreland made his first Premier League start for 996 days.\nStoke's Butland (43) has conceded more Premier League goals this season than any other goalkeeper.\nIn contrast, United's David de Gea has kept more clean sheets in the Premier League this season than any other keeper (13).\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to Turf Moor to face Burnley in the league on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Stoke host Huddersfield Town at the same time."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 0-4 Chelsea\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte complained about the \"negative press\" surrounding his side as he praised his players for their win over a spirited Brighton.\nThe Premier League champions moved up to third as two goals in the opening six minutes put them on the way to victory.\nEden Hazard opened the scoring for the visitors with a neat finish from inside the box and midfielder Willian added a second from 18 yards, after a slick move that he started, to leave Chris Hughton's side facing an uphill task.\nThe hosts' response was impressive. They should have had a penalty when Chelsea stand-in goalkeeper Willy Caballero upended defender Ezequiel Schelotto, while Israeli striker Tomer Hemed was brilliantly denied by the former Manchester City shot-stopper.\nNetherlands midfielder Davy Propper headed against the post and Schelotto went close after the break as Brighton pushed to get back in the game.\nChelsea were always a threat, though, and Willian had a free-kick pushed on to the post by Brighton keeper Mat Ryan before Hazard scored his second with a fine solo effort and Victor Moses' late goal completed the victory.\n\"We are unbeaten in 12 games,\" said Conte. \"A lot of the time the press tries to see the negative aspect, and not the positive aspect. This team, with many problems, is unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions.\n\"To win in this way, despite not having five important players, means every player deserves to have a chance and every player has to fight to play.\n\"Now we have to continue in this way. Every player showed great responsibility, and felt the responsibility. To grow in this aspect is very important for us.\"\nConte could savour a first league triumph of 2018 for his side and a strong finish to the game, although he lost defender Andreas Christensen to a head injury in the second half and was already without captain Gary Cahill, keeper Thibaut Courtois and Cesc Fabregas.\nHughton's concerns continue, despite his team's battling qualities. This defeat means they have won only one of their past 13 league games.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nFresh approach unrewarded for Brighton\nHughton tried something different at the back, selecting five defenders to try to halt his side's costly tendency to concede from set-pieces.\nBut it was in open play where they simply could not live with a team they have not beaten since 1933.\nBrighton, with a steady central-defensive pairing of Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy, have had a relatively mean defence this term - only the league's top eight sides had conceded fewer than them before this defeat.\nYet a mixture of misfortune and sloppy play cost them, with Hazard the benefactor on both occasions.\nFirst, Moses' early cross was deflected by Dale Stephens into the path of the Belgian, who quickly found a gap to score the opener. Then Duffy lost possession, allowing Hazard to zip forward and stroke home the third.\nThere were positives for the Seagulls. They caused Chelsea problems and, had the video assistant referee been in use, they could well have been awarded a penalty when Schelotto was felled.\nThe industrious Argentina full-back combined well with Pascal Gross down the right flank and will soon have a \u00a314m centre-forward to aim for in the shape of new signing Jurgen Locadia.\nWho needs a target man when you've got these two?\nLike their opponents, goals had been hard to come by for Chelsea recently, with only three in their past five games in all competitions - including three consecutive goalless draws.\nThis was some way to end the drought.\nWith striker Alvaro Morata, who had been struggling to score, suspended, Conte turned to Michy Batshuayi, who was hoping for an upturn in form after not scoring in the league since netting two against Watford in October.\nConte has reportedly spent much of the January transfer window so far searching for a target man who would make Batshuayi's first-team prospects even bleaker, after only four starts this term. Big centre-forwards such as Peter Crouch, Andy Carroll and Christian Benteke have all been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge.\nThat search might go on because Batshuayi, despite combining well with Hazard for Willian to score the second, failed to score.\nBut with that duo in this type of blistering form, Chelsea can ravage teams even without a free-scoring striker.\nFormer Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, signed to add attacking threat in the final third, was on the bench and not used at the Amex Stadium.\nConte opted to bring on 21-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda instead, and his deft lob created the fourth goal for Moses.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\n'I saw important things' - what they said\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a very difficult afternoon for us. The biggest disappointment is that 4-0 was not a true reflection of the game. We did come on to a bit of a game after going 2-0 down and we had decent opportunities, but we are finding it difficult to find the goals we need.\n\"I thought there were two [penalties that could have been given]. We see them briefly afterwards, but when you are Brighton playing at home to Chelsea you need as many things to go for you as possible.\n\"The second I didn't see well but the first one I thought it was a penalty. I thought we responded well but then we conceded two poor goals - and that made the scoreline not a reflection of the game.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was an important performance. We started very well and scored quickly, with good combinations. We started with a lot of worries, for injuries and suspensions, but the response of the team was incredible. I am very happy for this. Another clean sheet.\n\"Today it was a really good performance of the team. We moved the ball quickly, we tried to find the players between the lines, to have good combinations. I saw important things. Now we have to continue.\"\nHazard closes on Chelsea greats - the stats\nHazard has now scored (65) or assisted (37) in 102 Premier League goals for Chelsea; taking him ahead of Gianfranco Zola (101) to outright third for the club in the competition (Frank Lampard 237, Didiero Drogba 159).\nBrighton have picked up just one win from their past 13 Premier League games (D5 L7), failing to score in nine of these.\nChelsea have won 45 of their 76 away games against newly promoted sides in the Premier League, a joint-high figure (Arsenal have also won 45).\nThe Blues extended their top-flight unbeaten run to eight games (W5 D3), their longest streak without a defeat since March (also eight).\nWillian made his 50th consecutive Premier League appearance, the longest current run of any player in the competition.\nHazard's opener was his 100th goal in league football (now 101), with 65 coming for Chelsea and 36 for Lille.\nWillian has been directly involved in eight goals in his last five Premier League starts for Chelsea (3 goals, 5 assists), as many as he managed in his previous 20.\nBatshuayi registered his first assist in his last 31 Premier League appearances, since he set up Diego Costa on his debut in the competition in August 2016.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton travel to Middlesbrough in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 27 January (15:00 GMT), while Chelsea head to the Emirates on Wednesday to face Arsenal in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final (20:00 GMT)"

In the second half the challenge was to keep the same drive and we didn't manage to do that.\n\"The speed of our game at the start was good. We are the only team to beat Palace in their last 12 games.\n\"Not scoring had played on Lacazette's mind, it was starting to get heavy for him so that is a relief. We know the challenge in front of us is very difficult, exciting as well.\n\"For 45 minutes our fans have seen some great football.\"\nPalace manager Roy Hodgson: \"Three goals in 13 minutes put us on the back foot, it was a poor first half. Second half we at least played like the team we try to be. We took a heavy beating but at least it didn't get any worse. It could have become an avalanche of goals.\n\"It was easy street for Arsenal but we made it hard for them in the second half. We lost our marking twice on Nacho Monreal and he punished us, I don't think it's a malaise in the club or the way we play but Arsenal found a weakness today.\n\"They were every bit as good as they can be today. They scored a really good 'Arsenal goal' as well.\"\nMaqnifique! The stats\nAlexandre Lacazette's strike was the 500th by French players for Arsenal in the Premier League (excluding own goals) - 358 more than any other side in the competition.\nArsenal went 4-0 up in the opening 22 minutes in this game - the earliest a side has led by that many in a Premier League game since Liverpool against the Gunners themselves in February 2014 (20 minutes).\nNacho Monreal was involved in three of Arsenal's goals before being substituted (1 goal, 2 assists) - as many as in his previous 43 Premier League games combined (2 goals, 1 assist).\nRoy Hodgson is now winless in all 11 of his Premier League away London derbies as manager (D3 L8).\nArsenal are now unbeaten in their last 19 Premier League home games kicking off at 3pm on a Saturday (W17 D2), since losing to Aston Villa on the opening day of the 2013-14 campaign.\nLuka Milivojevic scored his seventh Premier League goal - with the Gunners the only team he's scored against more than once.\nCrystal Palace have now lost just two of their last 13 Premier League games (W5 D6), with both defeats coming against Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nThe Gunners host Chelsea in the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final on Tuesday, 23 January at 20:00 and, after sitting out the FA Cup action next weekend, they then travel to Swansea in the Premier League on Tuesday, 30 January with kick-off at 19:45.\nPalace are also out the cup, and next play when they take on West Ham away on 30 January at 19:45."

Eighth in the Premier League is no mean feat but we have to keep playing like that to get back to winning ways.\nAsked about a move for Everton's Aaron Lennon: \"Aaron Lennon is a possibility, there are a few players we have been linked with so we will see.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"If you don't score you are in trouble, they go direct, they are consistent in their approach it is really difficult.\n\"We defended very well, and it is fair to say Mike Dean and his team were very good. There was a lot of first ball, second ball and the physicality.\n\"Of course we are happy with him (Anthony Martial), we just want consistency, we know he has the talent.\"\nAsked about Alexis Sanchez coming to Manchester United from Arsenal: \"If you ask me if I think he is coming, I think so, but I have no confirmation.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley are next in action away to Newcastle on Wednesday 31 January, with Manchester United tackling Yeovil away on Friday, before a league trip to Tottenham on the same day as the Clarets' visit to Tyneside."

I'm holding it in. The players know they didn't perform today. There was a lack of performance and we must pick ourselves up and work hard to be more ready mentally.\"\nOn Theo Walcott's debut: \"Our players must understand where Theo likes to have the ball. Our players didn't pass well today. He's a great player with plenty of talent but we have to play in the right way.\"\nWest Brom manager Alan Pardew speaking to BBC Sport: \"There was disappointment in the dressing room and I was pleased with that, not coming off celebrating a draw here because we should've won.\"\nOn Salomon Rondon's performance: \"He was the outstanding player on the pitch and big Cyrille Regis would've been proud of him out there today. It was a fitting tribute and a great performance from Salomon.\"\nWalcott ends 475-day assist drought - key stats\nTheo Walcott started a Premier League game for the first time since 26 April (Arsenal v Leicester), 269 days ago.\nWalcott registered his first Premier League assist in 28 games, since 2 October 2016 (Arsenal v Burnley), 475 days ago.\nOumar Niasse has scored four goals as a substitute in the Premier League this season, a joint-high along with Olivier Giroud and Anthony Martial.\nNiasse scored just 56 seconds after coming off the bench, making the goal the fastest by a sub in the Premier League this season.\nEverton have gone six top-flight games without a win (three draws, three defeats), their longest run without a victory since April 2016 (seven games).\nWest Brom have enjoyed just one win in their last 22 Premier League games, drawing 11 and losing 10.\nJay Rodriguez has had a hand in three goals in his last four Premier League games (two goals, one assist), one more than he managed in his previous 19 for West Brom this season.\nJonjoe Kenny (on 38 minutes) registered Everton's first shot on target in 251 minutes of Premier League action.\nWhat's next?\nEverton, out of the FA Cup, have a break before their next Premier League game, at home to Leicester on 31 January (19:45 GMT). West Brom are back on Merseyside for an FA Cup trip to Liverpool next Saturday (19:45)."

The 20-year-old is clearly a talented player but he also hasn't scored since November and he struggled to make an impact in this game.\nDeeney returned to the starting line-up but aside from scoring an offside goal, his most telling contribution was playing Gray in for what looked like a promising chance until the excellent Harry Maguire got there to block his shot.\nClub-record signing Gray is stuck on four goals for the season and Marco Silva needs to find a way to get his forward line firing.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Leicester City)\n'Mahrez is enjoying playing' - the reaction\nLeicester boss Claude Puel speaking to the BBC's Match of the Day: \"The result was a fantastic reward for the squad because today was a tough game. Watford are a strong team, they battle well and they play good football. In the first half we needed a bit more quality to find the space behind them. In the second half, we did this much better without scoring a second goal and that made it difficult for us.\n\"What was pleasing was that we didn't give away many chances today - I think we controlled the game and it's a good feeling for us to win. For the moment, it's important for us to keep playing well on this run. If it's possible to improve the squad, of course we will look to do that, but the players have a fantastic spirit and there is a good balance about them.\"\nOn the future of goalscorer Riyad Mahrez: \"Mahrez is enjoying playing with his team-mates and he shows this every time he plays.\"\nWatford boss Marco Silva: \"Today was a tough game for both teams. We didn't deserve to be losing at half-time. They started the second half better but after our changes we created some problems for them. We had two clear chances to make it 1-1, which would have been a fair result but then obviously the second goal in the last minutes ended it.\n\"It wasn't a great game to watch. Our boys worked really hard - we knew it was a difficult place to come but the simple difference today was that they scored their chances and we didn't.\"\nOn the poor run: \"We want to win and get more points. The attitude and the commitment that I've seen these last two games is what we need. The Premier League is so difficult - we just need to turn the hard work into points and the confidence will come.\n\"I have confidence in all of our players.\"\nVardy boxes clever - the stats\nLeicester have won eight of their last 10 home league matches (including play-offs) against Watford, including each of the last three Premier League clashes.\nThe Hornets are on their longest run without a clean sheet since October 2016 (12 games).\nOnly Stoke (18) have gone behind in more Premier League games this season than Watford (17).\nSince the start of 2014-15 season, Jamie Vardy has won more penalties in the Premier League than any other player (13).\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2015, this was the first game in Watford's 100 in the competition where Heurelho Gomes failed to start.\nWatford have seen 10 goals scored in the 90th minute or later in their Premier League matches this season (five scored, five conceded).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Peterborough on Saturday, 27 January (12:30 GMT) for their FA Cup fourth-round tie, while Watford are at Southampton the same day (15:00), also in the FA Cup."

The sort of goal he got today might be typical. So we need to try to get a lot more balls in the box.\"\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nRelive West Ham's draw with Bournemouth as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nBournemouth had the chance to go back in front within three minutes of Hernandez's goal, only for Adrian to save from Junior Stanislas.\nThat frantic conclusion had looked unlikely prior to Fraser's opener, with the home side failing to make their early dominance count.\nIn the first half, Pablo Zabaleta fashioned an excellent low cross which found Arnautovic, but his goalbound shot was superbly stopped by Asmir Begovic, before Pedro Obiang shot just wide.\nThe result means the Hammers stay 11th and stretch their unbeaten run to seven games, while Eddie Howe's team have not lost in their past five league games and move up a place to 12th.\nInjury worries mount for Hammers\nA draw is far from the worst outcome for Moyes' side.\nHowever, this result, coupled with Watford's defeat at Leicester, meant the Hammers missed an opportunity to break into the top half of the Premier League, while their gap to the bottom three shrunk from six points to five.\nBut, perhaps of more pressing concern for the east London side, should be their mounting injury list.\nEarlier this week it was confirmed that striker Andy Carroll (ankle) would join players such as Michail Antonio (groin) and Jose Fonte (ankle) on the sidelines.\nDuring Saturday's game they lost Manuel Lanzini and Aaron Cresswell (cramp).\n\"Manu has a hamstring injury,\" Moyes said afterwards. \"That is the one we are worried about.\n\"We could do with a body or two coming in. We are working on getting the right players. Hopefully we will get something later in the window.\"\nMixed feelings for Bournemouth\nThough Bournemouth should ultimately find satisfaction in having taken a point from their 100th Premier League game, there will be frustration that they gave up their hard-earned lead so quickly.\nAfter a first half in which they had weathered a Hammers onslaught early on, the Cherries came into the match, with Lewis Cook curling a shot just wide of Adrian's right-hand post.\nAnd, with the game looking likely to fizzle out, Howe might have thought his side had scored a winner through Fraser's finish.\nBut Bournemouth's winless run in London stretched to 10 matches when Hernandez, on as a substitute for Lanzini was first to react to a loose ball.\nDespite the disappointment, the result marked continued progression for the visitors.\nWhen these clubs met on 26 December, the Cherries were 18th in the table a point from safety. Four games later, they are four points clear of the drop.\n'Every point is precious' - what they said\nWest Ham United manager David Moyes said: \"Mixed emotions. With 14 minutes to go I may have taken it [a draw] but prior to that we had some good play and missed big chances.\n\"As long as we keep picking up points we will move in the right direction. At periods in the first half we played some of the best football of my time here but we lacked a clinical edge.\"\nAFC Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe said: \"We weren't great in the first 20 minutes but we grew as it went on and deservedly scored. We are frustrated at the timing of their goal. Two headers we haven't won and it falls to the lad who taps in.\n\"We didn't have chance to build on the goal or use it to our advantage. We had a number of counter-attacks where the last pass let us down. We were the stronger team at the end.\"\nMan of the match - Ryan Fraser (AFC Bournemouth)\nFraser's influence - the stats\nBoth West Ham and Bournemouth are unbeaten in five Premier League games (W2 D3), their longest runs without a league defeat since May (also five).\nRyan Fraser has been directly involved in four goals in his last three Premier League games (three goals, one assist), as many as in his previous 26.\nJunior Stanislas registered his ninth Premier League assist, the joint-most by a Bournemouth player in the competition (also nine for Charlie Daniels).\nJavier Hernandez netted his 42nd Premier League goal, with all of them coming from inside the box.\nThere were just 64 seconds between the two goals in this game.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham's next match sees them travel to Wigan Athletic in the fourth-round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 27 January (15:00 GMT), before a return to Premier League action on Tuesday, 30 January, when Crystal Palace visit the London Stadium (19:45 GMT).\nBournemouth were knocked out of the FA Cup by Wigan, so they must wait until Wednesday, 31 January, for their next game which is a league trip to Chelsea (19:45 GMT)."

I'd forgotten what it was actually like.\n\"You sometimes wonder why you come back in. I was enjoying my life last weekend, but it's for this - the atmosphere was outstanding.\n\"From the moment I came to the club, it was about the supporters and the players and they bounced off each other. You can't hear yourself shout at times.\n\"If they stick together and we play that way, we might not win every game, but if we keep that level of intensity, we will be fine.\"\nHuddersfield, without a league win since 16 December, rarely threatened.\nSteve Mounie had the Terriers' best attempt, a well-struck effort from distance straight at Jack Butland late on.\nPeter Crouch, a target for Chelsea, came on for the final 15 minutes for the hosts. It could be the striker's final appearance for the club if a move materialises as the Potters are not in action again until 31 January - transfer deadline day.\nStoke moved up to 17th with the victory, while Huddersfield are three points above the relegation zone.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nRelive Stoke's first win under Lambert\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League action\nStoke take step in right direction\nLambert succeeded Hughes on Monday, and immediately highlighted Stoke's leaky defence as something that needed fixing if they were to pull away from the relegation zone.\nThe 3-0 defeat at Manchester United just hours after Lambert's appointment meant Stoke had conceded 50 goals after 23 games. That is the third worst record at this stage of any Premier League season and made them the first club in Europe's top five divisions to reach the half-century.\nLambert was boosted by the return of centre-back and captain Ryan Shawcross - in the side for the first time since 26 December after recovering from a calf injury - and there was certainly much more steel in the Stoke backline against a Huddersfield team who failed to manage a single shot on target in the first half.\nThe Potters will certainly face sterner tests than a team who have scored just eight goals away from home all season, but having conceded 10 in their three league games prior to this, this was a positive step.\nTimid Terriers a concern for Wagner\nFavourites for relegation at the start of the season, Huddersfield have surpassed many people's expectations in their first Premier League campaign, but their recent form will be of serious concern for manager David Wagner.\nThe Terriers have lost their past three league games, and not won in six.\nPlaymaker Alex Pritchard, signed this month from Norwich, was brought in to try to add creativity to an attack that has been so often lacklustre this season.\nThey have scored the fewest amount of goals in the Premier League - 19 from 24 games - and while they had three shots on target here, none truly troubled Butland.\nHuddersfield were promoted by playing a brand of football that relied on slick, one-touch passes to quickly turn defence into attack - but that was not evident against Stoke. Just 55% of the visitors' passes successfully found a team-mate.\nThe Terriers have not been in the relegation zone so far this season but that could change quickly if they are unable to rediscover the style of football that served them so well last season, and at the beginning of this campaign\nMan of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri\n'Stoke have a lot of quality'\nStoke City boss Paul Lambert, speaking to Match of the Day: \"There's a lot of quality. We shouldn't be in the position we're in. Mark Hughes did a fantastic job here for four years, Tony Pulis before him.\n\"The lads know for whatever reason they've been underperforming but big compliments to them today, they were fantastic.\"\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was difficult. For me, it was because Stoke and their supporters were really on it. They were really aggressive and limited us and I felt they deserved it. They limited our offensive game.\n\"It shouldn't be a surprise that Stoke is a top-quality side even if they are not in the best position in the table. We fought and tried everything but were limited offensively.\n\"I have to accept where we are in the table. It's only us who can change it. We have fought since the first day of the season and, even though we have now six games with only three points, we know we have to collect more points to survive.\"\nLambert's four-year wait - the stats\nDiouf's goal was his 22nd in the Premier League for Stoke - making him their joint-third highest goalscorer in the competition (Jonathan Walters 43, Peter Crouch 43, Marko Arnautovic 22).\nLambert earned his first win as a Premier League manager in 11 games - since his Aston Villa side beat Leicester 2-1 in December 2014.\nThe Potters kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League since October (1-0 at Watford), having conceded 30 goals in their 13 previous games.\nThe Terriers are now winless in six Premier League games, losing each of the past three in a row (D3).\nAllen has had a hand in four goals in his past five Premier League games (two goals, two assists), as many as in his previous 43 combined.\nWhat next?\nIt is another home game for Stoke next as they host Watford on Wednesday, 31 January (15:00 GMT). Huddersfield, meanwhile, host Championship side Birmingham in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 27 January (15:00 GMT). Their next Premier League game is at home to Liverpool on Tuesday, 30 January (20:00 GMT)."

It was important how we reacted at 2-1 - we didn't panic.\"\nCity gain a deserved win, despite a scare\nCity looked on course for a routine victory after dominating the first half and the early stages of the second.\nAs well as City's opening two goals through Aguero, they had many other chances with the impressive Karl Darlow twice saving from Raheem Sterling, including a fine stop to push the England forward's attempt on to the post.\nNewcastle had only had 17% possession in the first half, but were given a lifeline when City lost the ball, Ciaran Clark played it forward and Murphy ran through to score a well-taken first goal for the club.\nIndeed, the visitors had a chance to equalise with Ederson parrying Mohamed Diame's effort and then the follow-up from Joselu.\nBut City killed off any hopes of a Newcastle fightback as Sane's fine run saw him set up Aguero, who scored for the seventh time in five matches.\nBenitez expecting new signings\nNewcastle are 15th in the table, but are only two points above 18th-placed Southampton - who would go above them with victory over Tottenham on Sunday - and there is uncertainty over the club's future.\nEarlier this week, club owner Mike Ashley announced he had ended talks with businesswoman Amanda Staveley over a takeover that could have been worth around \u00a3250m - and that has left manager Rafael Benitez unsure over how much he will be able to spend during January's transfer window.\nAfter the game, Benitez again stressed the need for new signings as the team hopes to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\n\"It's the Premier League and everyone is spending a lot of money,\" said Benitez.\n\"That is why we expect something in this window. Hopefully we can see some new faces before the end of this window.\"\nOne of Newcastle's main weaknesses remains up front - they have only scored six times in their last eight games - and only registered four shots on target against City.\nLandmark for Aguero - the stats\nSergio Aguero is the seventh player to reach 200 Premier League appearances for Manchester City (also Hart, Dunne, Silva, Kompany, Zabaleta, Yaya Toure)\nKevin de Bruyne and Leroy Sane have each provided 10 assists in the Premier League this season - a joint-high.\nRaheem Sterling has won more penalties this season than any other Premier League player (four).\nOnly Wayne Rooney (15) has scored more Premier League goals against Newcastle than Sergio Aguero (14)\nManchester City have conceded in seven of their last eight home games in all competitions, after keeping three clean sheets in the previous four.\nJacob Murphy scored his first Newcastle goal in what was his 19th appearance for the club in all competitions.\nAguero has scored the first perfect Premier League hat-trick (header, left foot, right foot) since the Argentine himself scored one against Newcastle in October 2015.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\n'The penalty was a bit soft' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Sport: \"We face these kind of teams - Southampton, West Ham, Bournemouth, who play with the 5-4-1 - that's why it's so important to attack this kind of team.\n\"When you have the ball, the opponent does not. To concede, they have to have it. It's not easy, with 10 players plus the keeper behind the ball.\n\"I don't know how many, but we created a lot of chances. Even at 2-1, how we reacted was good, we kept going, kept playing and made a difference.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez told Match of the Day: \"We wanted to stay in the game and we did it, the penalty was a bit soft and it changed everything. After we scored we had a couple of chances. They are a very good team, our reaction was quite good.\n\"We changed at the end and played with four at the back, the idea was to stay solid and try to regain and play counter-attack. At the beginning we were giving the ball away easily. To find the balance between defending and attacking is what we were trying to do.\n\"I have been praising the players the whole season in terms of effort, sometimes it's a bit of luck. If you have a little bit of luck you can be ahead in some games.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester City have two away cup games against Championship sides before they return to Premier League action.\nOn Tuesday, 23 January, they play at Bristol City (19:45 GMT) in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, with a 2-1 advantage after the first leg, before playing at Cardiff City in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 28 January (16:00), which will be broadcast live on BBC One.\nPep Guardiola's side next play in the Premier League on Wednesday, 31 January, with a home game against strugglers West Brom (20:00).\nNewcastle are at Chelsea in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 28 January (13:30) and they then entertain Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday, 31 January (19:45)."

It is part of our life,\" said Argentine Pellegrino, who has been at St Mary's since June.\n\"In Argentina we say that the job is the electric chair - it is not easy to stay in the seat.\"Southampton 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur\nSunday's result means Tottenham missed the chance to move level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool.\nThe hosts took a deserved early lead as Spurs central defender Davinson Sanchez diverted Ryan Bertrand's low cross into his own net.\nThe advantage lasted less than four minutes, though, with Harry Kane - the division's top scorer - nodding home a straightforward header as the Saints defence failed to compete for Ben Davies' corner.\nJack Stephens missed a glorious opportunity to restore Southampton's lead before the break, but neither side could carve out the same quality of chance before a frantic finale.\nAs Tottenham rallied late on, Stephens made amends for his earlier error by blocking Erik Lamela's goalbound shot with six minutes to go.\nAt the other end, 17-year-old debutant Michael Obafemi could not direct Dusan Tadic's shot on goal with one of his first touches off the bench, before Sofiane Boufal and Kane wasted openings for their respective sides.\nSouthampton are a point off 17th-placed Stoke in the table.\nTottenham, however, will be cut five points adrift of the top four if Liverpool beat Swansea on Monday.\nSaints' lapse holds them back\nSouthampton's performance showed both the reasons behind their rotten form and why their general play has merited more.\nEven before Sanchez poked the ball into the back of his own net, Manolo Gabbiadini had tested Michel Vorm from distance and come close to getting a telling touch to Tadic's cross.\nTottenham's equaliser did nothing to sap their attacking energy and enthusiasm either, with Stephens heading past the angle of post and bar from James Ward-Prowse's vicious delivery.\nIntelligent in possession and organised without the ball, it was the sort of display that had secured a point at Manchester United and come within a few minutes of beating Arsenal during their winless run.\nBut it had been undermined by a horrendous lapse in concentration.\nJust 197 seconds after Saints took the lead, Kane eased aside Stephens, rose above Gabbiadini and planted a header past a rooted Alex McCarthy from five yards.\nReports before the match claimed Monaco striker Guido Carrillo and Spartak Moscow winger Quincy Promes\n, external\nare in Pellegrino's sights as he seeks to reinvest the windfall from Virgil van Dijk's \u00a375m move to Liverpool.\nTo invest in more firepower, rather than a commanding defensive figure similar to their departed Dutchman, might be the gamble that decides the Argentine's future.\nAlli still searching for his groove\nWith Tottenham short of the scintillating form that had sliced apart Everton last weekend, manager Mauricio Pochettino brought Son Heung-Min into the centre of his attack, just behind Kane, from the left wing at half-time.\nWhen the South Korean's guile could not unpick the lock, he was replaced by Erik Lamela with 20 minutes remaining.\nThe problem may have been the man left on the pitch, however.\nDele Alli has scored two goals in his past 16 matches and, without the ill Christian Eriksen alongside him, was again ineffectual in the playmaking role.\nThe 21-year-old admitted in December\n, external\nthat he was struggling to recreate the stellar form of his previous two campaigns.\nPochettinho, while admitting a saturated St Mary's surface did not help, was not happy with the tempo his side set in attack.\n\"We needed to move the ball quicker and create more,\" he said.\n\"A few players were affected last week with illness but it's not an excuse.\n\"The result is the result because football punishes us for not using the ball.\"\nAs the run-in gathers pace and the World Cup looms, both he and England counterpart Gareth Southgate will hope Alli can rediscover his form soon.\nMan of the match - Ryan Bertrand (Southampton)\nWorst dry run since 1998 - the stats\nSouthampton are winless in their past 11 Premier League games, their longest such run without a victory since October 1998, also 11 games, and their longest across a single season since March 1995.\nSince losing five consecutive top-flight trips to Southampton between 2000 and 2005, without scoring, Spurs are unbeaten in their past six league visits to St Mary's.\nThe Saints have lost nine points from leading positions at St Mary's this season; more than any other Premier League side on home soil.\nKane has netted 11 goals in his past six starts in all competitions for Tottenham.\nKane has scored six goals in his past five Premier League games against Southampton, including three in his past three at St Mary's.\nAged 17 years and 199 days, Obafemi became the second youngest player to make a Premier League appearance for Southampton after Luke Shaw, who was 17 years and 116 days old.\n'It is not easy to stay in the seat' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"We have to continue in this way, the spirit and the commitment on the pitch was very good. Against these types of team you can lose in a minute, everything can change but we were there until the end.\n\"We are in trouble in the table but in three or four weeks it can change. Between 10 or 11 teams there are just a few points and that will stay the same.\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"The game was even, we had more possession but we needed to be more aggressive and create more chances, The performance wasn't great but the pitch didn't help.\n\"You must give credit to the opponent, but I am not happy with our performance.\n\"It is temporary that Southampton are in the relegation zone, for sure they will push up the table. It is two points we are going to miss at the end of the season because it is so tough between six or seven teams.\nOn possible transfer-window business: \"It is not easy to add a player who can help for three months.

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-0 Liverpool\nManager Carlos Carvalhal says Swansea put \"Formula 1 car\" Liverpool in traffic as the Premier League's bottom club claimed a famous victory at the Liberty Stadium.\nAlfie Mawson's goal proved the difference as the Swans recorded a potentially priceless win in their fight against relegation.\nLiverpool, unbeaten in their previous 18 games, had by far the better scoring chances but some poor finishing, fine home defending and an impressive display from goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski kept them at bay.\nThe closest they came was when Roberto Firmino struck a post with a late header.\nKlopp apologises after reacting to fan\nReaction from the Liberty Stadium\nSwansea have been beaten just once in six matches since the appointment of Carvalhal, while Liverpool lost for the first time since Spurs beat them 4-1 on 22 October.\n\"I talked with my players and said this Liverpool is a really strong team,\" said Carvalhal, who has secured seven points in his first four league games.\n\"They are like a Formula 1 car. But at 4pm in London it will be difficult to speed, they would be a car like any other.\n\"We needed to make sure there was traffic, we could not let them have open roads to drive in.\"\nSwansea were six points adrift of safety heading into the match, having lost eight games in a row against sides in the top six. But after Monday night's win, Carvalhal's side are within three points of 17th.\nThe Reds, meanwhile, failed to narrow the gap on Chelsea and Manchester United but remain fourth.\nThey came into this game on the back of a superb win over leaders Manchester City but lost for only the third time in the league this season after a lacklustre display.\n\"I am more frustrated about the performance than the result,\" said Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. \"We didn't play how we wanted to play.\n\"We gave them the opportunity to score and then we did exactly what Swansea wanted. Swansea knew that to win they needed our help, and unfortunately we gave it to them.\"\nGoal-shy Swansea stay with pack\nHeading into this match the hosts had scored only 22 goals all season across all competitions - two fewer than Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah alone.\nThe Swans had lost seven of their previous 11 home matches and a loss to Liverpool would have equalled their worst home record in the Premier League, so it was perhaps no surprise that they approached the contest more like an away match.\nHaving shipped five goals at Anfield just 27 days ago, that cautious approach made sense, especially considering Swansea had lost each of their past eight home fixtures against the top six, conceding 25 goals in the process.\nWhile they might have lacked Liverpool's quality, their game management will have thrilled Carvalhal.\nTheir back three of Mawson, Federico Fernandez and Mike van der Hoorn were superb and, as the contest wore on, they had an outlet in the tireless Jordan Ayew, who might have added a second but saw his effort was well saved by Loris Karius.\nLiverpool pushed until the end with substitute Danny Ings testing Fabianski. Swansea were then forced to repel cross after cross but the result was secured when Salah blasted over and Firmino struck the post in time added on.\nPersonnel changes mean adjustment for Liverpool\nJanuary has been a month of adjustment for Liverpool and their first league contest with Virgil van Dijk at the heart of their defence provided a look at what they have gained and lost.\nThe world's most expensive defender looked assured and composed for long spells, even contributing to a host of attacks, but he was also central to the goal.\nHe failed to effectively cut out two successive crosses, heading both out for corners, and his timid header then struck Swansea skipper Fernandez and fell perfectly for Mawson, who finished like a striker into the bottom corner.\nThe goal, which sparked celebrations so wild Fernandez broke his nose, was harsh on a Liverpool side missing the invention and creative spark provided by the departed Philippe Coutinho.\nThat might not have been the case in the thrilling 4-3 win against Manchester City, when Pep Guardiola's side were happy to give as good as they got and leave space, but it was a different story against a side with 11 men behind the ball.\nWhen they did break through, Van Dijk headed wide from an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain corner and freed Salah beautifully with a ball over the top that the Egyptian fired over, before Fabianski denied Oxlade-Chamberlain.\nThe visitors should have levelled just before the break but Sadio Mane could only volley wide after Salah's centre, and a sense of desperation crept into Liverpool's play as the contest wore on.\nMan of the match - Alfie Mawson (Swansea)\nTurning the table upside down - the stats\nSince the start of 2014-15, this is only the third time the team starting the day bottom of the table have beaten a team in the top four (W3 D4 L20). The other two occasions were Crystal Palace against Chelsea this season, and Swansea at Liverpool in 2016-17.\nSwansea have earned seven points in their four Premier League games under Carlos Carvalhal (W2 D1 L1), two more than they'd picked up in their 12 before his arrival (W1 D2 L9).\nThis was Liverpool's first defeat in 15 Premier League games (W10 D4), and just their third in the competition this season.\nJurgen Klopp has lost three Premier League games against Swansea, more than he has against any other opponent in the competition.\nAlfie Mawson is only the second Swansea player to score more than once in the Premier League at the Liberty Stadium this season, after Tammy Abraham (three).\nLiverpool had 20 shots to Swansea's three in this match, but only managed two more attempts on target than the hosts (2).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in FA Cup fourth-round action on Saturday, when Swansea look to avoid a shock at League Two Notts County (15:00 GMT) and Liverpool host West Brom in the late game (19:45)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-1 Crystal Palace\nWest Ham came from behind to draw with Crystal Palace despite being without forward Michail Antonio, who was left out of the team as punishment for being late for a team meeting.\nThe injury-hit hosts trailed to Christian Benteke's header but drew level from the penalty spot through captain Mark Noble after James Tomkins brought down Javier Hernandez.\nDavid Moyes' side are now unbeaten in six games and move up to 10th place, while the Eagles are 12th - three points above 18th-place Stoke.\nHammers goalkeeper Adrian pushed away a low curling effort from Andros Townsend, who set up Benteke's goal, and James McArthur headed wastefully wide for Palace, who lost Bakary Sako to injury.\nA lively first half, when Palace's Luka Milivojevic sent an effort narrowly over the bar and Tomkins earlier denied Hernandez with a well-timed tackle, was followed by a drab second.\nMoyes will take further heart from an impressive debut by Portugal international Joao Mario, a loan signing from Inter Milan, who played a part in the build-up to the penalty, but both teams struggled for chances after the break with Hernandez going closest when his header was saved by Wayne Hennessey.\nAntonio would have provided another attacking option for West Ham but Moyes adopted a tough stance following the 27-year-old's disciplinary breach.\n\"He turned up late this morning for a meeting and it wasn't the first time,\" he said. \"I'm not having it at the club. I've said right from the start what it's going to be like.\n\"It's too often so I didn't involve him tonight, otherwise I would have probably tried to get him on the bench. He's apologised for it and because of that we move on.\n\"He'll be back training tomorrow morning. On time!\n\"He's got a chance of being in the squad (at Brighton on Saturday), but he would have been a big help for us tonight.\"\nBoth clubs have reaped the benefit of sacking their former managers early in the season after difficult starts.\nPalace acted first, appointing Roy Hodgson on a two-year deal in September after just 77 days and five games under Frank de Boer left them winless, goalless and rock-bottom of the table. Under the 70-year-old they have now won six, scored 23 and moved further from the drop zone.\nThe Hammers gave Slaven Bilic more time but eventually sacked the Croat in November after dropping into the bottom three. Moyes was appointed the day after, and is overseeing a continued improvement.\nMoyes makes do and mends\nDavid Moyes' starting XI proved how badly he needs attacking additions to the squad before Wednesday's deadline.\nWith 10 senior players missing through injury, including Andy Carroll, Manuel Lanzini and Marko Arnautovic, the Scot was forced to field a team with six defenders and two defensive midfielders.\nThe team was short on pace and this was exposed in the build-up to Palace's opener when Andros Townsend raced past Declan Rice too easily to tee up Benteke.\nThe Hammers rose above their offensive limitations through sheer graft; 33-year-old right-back Pablo Zabaleta rolled back the years in midfield with an energetic display and skipper Noble, 30, covered 11.75 km - more ground than any team-mate.\nZabaleta's deployment in midfield was a smart move by Moyes, as the former Manchester City player stuck doggedly to Palace danger man Wilfried Zaha, ensuring the winger could cause few problems.\nThe hosts had little opportunity to change anything from the bench in a tight second half and, short of goalkeeper Joe Hart and centre-back Jose Fonte, 34, their substitutes were an assortment of largely untested youngsters.\nEagles lack cutting edge\nBenteke reminded Palace fans what he can do with a classic centre-forward's header to give his side the lead.\nThereafter he also reminded them why they can become frustrated by him, and why Hodgson may want further signings before the window closes.\nAfter dominating the first half in an attacking sense the Eagles' threat fizzled out as the game wore on, and in the end they only managed one more shot (nine) than their defensively-minded opponents.\nBenteke, 27, has scored 25 headed goals in the Premier League since his debut in September 2012 - but this was only his second goal in 19 appearances for Palace this season.\nAfter the Eagles lost Benteke's strike partner Sako to an injury, Hodgson later said it \"doesn't look good\" for the Mali international.\nHodgson may have to focus on trying to add more firepower which can exploit the creative talents of Zaha and Townsend.\nThe South Londoners are resilient, though. They have now lost just two of their past 14 games, and those survival hopes increase with every point.\nMan of the match - Mark Noble (West Ham)\nAndros the Creator - the stats\nAndros Townsend's cross for Benteke's goal was his fifth assist of the season - his best ever return in a Premier League campaign.\nThe tricky winger has been directly involved in five goals in his past six Premier League games for the Eagles (1 goal, 4 assists).\nWest Ham are unbeaten in their past six Premier League encounters with Crystal Palace (W3 D3), with both games ending level this season.\nCrystal Palace have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their past 13 Premier League London derbies away from home - last recording a shutout in December 2014 against QPR.\nThe Hammers are unbeaten in their past six Premier League outings (W2 D4), their longest run without a defeat since April 2016 (10 games unbeaten).\nSince losing their first London derby of the season against Tottenham, West Ham have remained unbeaten in the next five (W1 D5), the Hammers' longest unbeaten streak since November 2005 (five games unbeaten).\nMark Noble is the 11th player to score 20+ penalties in the Premier League.\nChristian Benteke has scored 25 headed goals in the Premier League since his debut in September 2012 - only Olivier Giroud (27) has netted more in this period.\n'Joao Mario settled quickly' - what they said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I was pleased with a point because of the amount of key players we had.\n\"Crystal Palace have probably been the form team outside the top six. Every club has injuries, it's a chance for other players to show what they can do.\n\"Joao Mario settled in really quickly, which is always a worry when you bring a player in from abroad. He looks as if he is quite good at all the things.\n\"He handled the ball well and we needed him, he was important to us.\"\nRoy Hodgson on Palace's transfer business: \"The chairman and sporting director Dougie Freedman are working - they certainly haven't left the phone and haven't stopped trying to improve our squad as they realise it's something we have to do.\n\"There are always players out there - but are they players who are going to improve you and help you win games? Those players are much harder to find.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Brighton on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Crystal Palace host Newcastle at Selhurst Park on Sunday (14:15 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 3-1 Arsenal\nSwansea City moved out of the Premier League relegation zone for the first time since November following a shock victory over Arsenal.\nA horrendous error from goalkeeper Petr Cech allowed Jordan Ayew to score a tap-in which put the hosts ahead just after the hour mark, before Sam Clucas' second goal made the result safe.\nMesut Ozil's sensational pass had allowed Nacho Monreal to open the scoring for the Gunners, but Clucas levelled for Swansea within a minute at the Liberty Stadium.\nSwansea earned back-to-back wins for the first time this season, while Arsene Wenger's side have won only three of 13 Premier League away games this term.\nLive reaction to Tuesday night's Premier League matches\n\"I felt defensively we were very poor and made big mistakes. It's better not to talk about the second or third goals,\" said Wenger.\n\"Swansea were sharp, disciplined and hungry. Unfortunately I believe we were not good enough, I believe we were not disciplined enough.\"\nSwans improved under Carvalhal\nUnder new boss Carlos Carvalhal, Swansea have now lost only once in eight games and victory over Arsenal was their second successive win against a team in the top six.\nFree-scoring Liverpool were blunted in the Swans' previous outing at the Liberty Stadium and the hosts carried on that form as they dominated their visitors in the early part of the match.\nOnly a brilliant Aaron Ramsey tackle denied Alfie Mawson a tap-in from close range in the first half and an effort from Ayew looped over the bar off Mustafi with Cech wrong-footed and unable to act.\nMawson also shot just wide as Arsenal failed to clear a corner, before the England Under-21 defender provided the defence-splitting pass that allowed Clucas to score his first goal since he found the net at the Emirates in the reverse fixture on 28 October.\nWhile that strike was worthy of praise, Swansea's second goal was entirely down to deficiencies in the Arsenal defence.\nMustafi's backpass proved awkward for Cech who sliced a clearance straight to Ayew and the Ghanaian slotted home from close range.\nClucas wrapped things up on 86 minutes, firing home after another lung-busting run from the impressive Ayew.\nA farewell to Giroud?\nFor the Gunners, chasing a fourth successive win at the Liberty Stadium, there was a keen sense of intrigue regarding Arsene Wenger's team selection, with the imminent closing of the January transfer window.\nArsenal hope to conclude the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang before Wednesday evening, but that deal is thought to hinge on two others, including French striker Olivier Giroud switching from the Emirates to Stamford Bridge.\nGiroud was included in Arsenal's squad despite rumours to the contrary, but had to be content with a place on the bench alongside new arrival Henrikh Mkhitaryan.\nAnd it was clear from the start that Arsenal fans have, at the very least, mixed feelings on the potential departure of Giroud.\nHis name was sung by the travelling fans throughout the match and if he is to depart, some Gunners fans will clearly miss him.\nHowever, those same supporters will no doubt relish the potential arrival of Aubameyang to give them a sharper focus in attack.\nThe Gunners failed to register a single shot on goal at the Liberty Stadium until almost the 30 minute mark, with Lukasz Fabianski easily able to turn an Alex Iwobi effort around the post.\nArsenal did score from their next attack when Ozil's sumptuous ball found Monreal unmarked and he finished like a striker from close range, left-footed.\nArsenal, however, were unable to hold their advantage for long, with the Swans level inside two minutes after Clucas' finish.\nIndeed, had Leroy Fer passed to Ayew after powering through the Arsenal defence five minutes before the break, things could have been even better for the hosts.\nMkhitaryan had been on the pitch for less than two minutes when Cech's error handed Swansea the lead.\nThe Swans should then have killed off the game, but Nathan Dyer's fierce drive went just wide via the outside of the post after Ayew's lay-off.\nGiroud was introduced for the ineffective Iwobi with 15 minutes remaining - to a rapturous reception from the visiting fans - but he did not get a sniff before Swansea were able to make the result safe when more hesitancy in the Arsenal defence allowed Clucas to pounce and fire home his second from close range.\nMan of the match - Alfie Mawson (Swansea)\n'We are breathing now, we're not dead anymore'\nSwansea City boss Carlos Carvalhal: \"We knew Arsenal would have more of the ball, as they do against almost all the teams in the Premier League.\n\"We knew if we put them under pressure it would create clear situations. We waited for our moment and then we scored. I must give all the credit to my players.\n\"We are breathing again now, we are not dead anymore. We've achieved nothing so far, but we are on our way to achieving a good position.\n\"We are not in a good position yet, but we can get there.\"\nThe stats - Carvalhal enjoys Wenger meeting\nSwansea have won consecutive Premier League games for the first time this season.\nCarlos Carvalhal is just the fifth manager to win his first two matches against Arsene Wenger's Arsenal in all competitions (also Alex Ferguson, Luis Enrique, John Gregory and Roy Evans).\nArsenal have only taken 13 points away from home this season, their second fewest at this stage of a Premier League season (2005-06, 12)\nArsenal have lost 15 points from winning positions this season in the Premier League - only Watford have dropped more (16).\nNacho Monreal has scored four goals in his 21 Premier League games this season, after managing one in his previous five top-flight campaigns with Arsenal (134 games).\nAll three of Sam Clucas's top-flight goals for Swansea have come against Arsenal, and have come with his only three shots on target for the Welsh side in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea visit Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Arsenal host Everton on Saturday in a 17:30 kick-off."

Coming back on track is the most important thing. There is an open bill and we need to pay that back.\"\nEmre Can's deflected long-range effort found the bottom corner to put the Reds ahead midway through the first half, after the hosts' Laurent Depoitre had missed the best early chance.\nRoberto Firmino threaded a finish between goalkeeper Jonas Lossl and his near post for a second just before the break.\nMohamed Salah took over penalty-taking duties after Firmino's missed effort in the FA Cup defeat by West Brom and put the outcome beyond doubt after Philip Billing's foul on Can.\nThe defeat leaves Huddersfield just one point above the relegation zone.\nLiverpool see out win at exhibition pace\nOn their current run of form, a trip to another of the Premier League's lesser lights and a boisterous, bouncing John Smith's Stadium was another potential pitfall for Liverpool.\nCan's daisy-cutter settled their nerves however, catching a critical ricochet off Billing to worm its way into the bottom corner from 25 yards, before Firmino cannily disguised his intentions as he finished from the tightest of angles.\nOnce ahead, the visitors defused any danger by monopolising possession.\nMuch of the second half was played at little more than exhibition pace as the visitors banked a mammoth 75% of the ball and were rarely threatened.\nSadio Mane could have extended the lead with two fine headed chances and Salah's penalty was amends for the Egypt international earlier missing when well placed on his weaker right foot.\nBut, even for Liverpool team that has struggled to see out leads, two goals had looked more than enough. The hosts have only 19 goals from their 25 league games so far this season.\nThis victory and Arsenal's defeat at Swansea moves the Reds eight points ahead of the sixth-placed Gunners after 25 games.\nSunday's home match against Tottenham - who host Manchester United on Wednesday in their game in hand - offers a chance to open up a decisive gap between the top four and the rest.\nKlopp wins the battle of best friends\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner had hinted before kick-off at a surprise for his Liverpool counterpart and close friend Jurgen Klopp. It came in his team's tactics.\nHuddersfield deployed an unfamiliar three-man defence, featuring loanee Terence Kongolo alongside Mathias Jorgensen and Christopher Schindler and, in anticipation of Liverpool's pressing game, ditched their usual commitment to playing out from the back.\nFor the opening quarter, their deep defensive block befuddled Liverpool, sending them down blind alleys and into harmless wide positions.\nBut while bottom side Swansea had succeeded in keeping Liverpool hemmed in for a whole match in the previous round of league games, Can's opener sprung the lock for the visitors.\nDepoitre had tested Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius with a low shot from Chris Lowe in the 17th minute, but the Terriers did not manage a second on target.\nWith supply to Depoitre and fellow targetman Steve Mounie strangled, Liverpool's centre-halves Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip's vulnerabilities escaped serious examination, and Klopp's decision to rest record signing Virgil van Dijk was vindicated.\nMan of the match - Emre Can (Liverpool)\n'Exactly what we needed' - what they said\nHuddersfield Town manager David Wagner: \"I think no doubt the better side won today. We are not dreamers, if we want to get something from better sides, all the details need to go in your favour.\n\"We conceded an unlucky goal from 25 yards and before that we had the best chance in the game from Depoitre. It was a difficult night when all the details went against us.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"We could have done better, but we scored the first goal, we maybe gave one situation away, but it was difficult for Huddersfield to counter-attack.\n\"Tonight we were better and the midfield did well with the counter press and that helped the back line. It was nearly perfect - not the performance, the result.\n\"Now we have a few days to prepare for another difficult game against Tottenham.\"\nSalah's quarter-century - the match stats\nLiverpool have lost just once in their past 16 Premier League games, winning 11 and drawing four.\nThis was the 58th ground at which Liverpool have played in the Premier League - they've won at more stadiums than any other side in the competition (54).\nHuddersfield are without a win in their past seven Premier League games (three draws followed by four losses) and have enjoyed just two wins in their past 14 in the competition (D3 L9).\nMohamed Salah has had a hand in 25 Premier League goals this season, the most of any player in the competition (19 goals, 6 assists).\nRoberto Firmino has been directly involved in 10 goals in his past 12 Premier League appearances against newly promoted teams (eight goals, two assists).\nAnd Firmino has scored five and assisted two more in his past six Premier League matches on the road.\nFive of Emre Can's nine Premier League goals have been scored from outside the box, including three of his past five.\nWhat's next\nHuddersfield travel to Manchester United in the league on Saturday, while Liverpool welcome Tottenham to Anfield on Sunday afternoon."

I'd have taken that after the first half because they were the better side. We still looked like we were finding our feet and it was almost a new group playing tonight, in the sense that they haven't played that many games together.\n\"We weren't making the connections you need, but that got better in the second half and, in the end, we were the side going for the win.\n\"It's frustrating when you haven't won for a while and we are having a tough run at the moment, but we've got 35 points on the board and we're back up to seventh in the Premier League.\"\nHome is 'not so sweet' for Newcastle - the stats\nNewcastle are winless in eight Premier League games at St James' Park (W0 D3 L5), their worst run since April 2009 (also eight without a win).\nBurnley haven't won any of their last 51 Premier League games when they've conceded the first goal (D10 L41).\nAll three of Lascelles' goals in the Premier League this season have been headers from corners.\nJoselu is the first Newcastle player to miss a Premier League penalty since Loic Remy on Boxing Day in 2013 against Stoke.\nPope has faced five Premier League penalties in just 22 appearances - Joselu's effort was the first one he has saved.\nKenedy became the first Brazilian to play for Newcastle in the Premier League since Claudio Cacapa in December 2008, and just the third Brazilian to appear for them in Premier League history along with Fumaca.\nKarl Darlow is just the second Newcastle goalkeeper to score a Premier League own goal, after Shay Given in October 2007 against Everton.\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle head to London to face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park (14:15 GMT) on Sunday - their second visit to the capital in a week following the FA Cup exit at Chelsea.\nBurnley will welcome Premier League leaders Manchester City to Turf Moor on Saturday (12:30 GMT)."

The striker also had the honour of scoring Brighton's 200th goal in the top flight.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the crossbar for Southampton in the first half after charging down a clearance from goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\nRelive the action\nRyan was beaten just after the hour mark as Stephens followed up his winner in the weekend's FA Cup success over Watford by applying a deft back-heel finish from close range to James Ward-Prowse's free-kick.\nThe result lifted Brighton up to 15th, a point clear of 18th-placed Southampton.\nSaints' saviour?\nSouthampton are still without a league victory since the end of November, but new signing Guido Carrillo could be the man to come to fellow Argentine Mauricio Pellegrino's rescue.\nThe \u00a319m signing from Monaco made his Premier League debut as a half-time replacement for Dusan Tadic, having also replaced the Serbia winger in the closing stages against Watford in the FA Cup.\nThe 26-year-old, who scored five goals in 22 appearances for the French side this season, did not get off the mark in the Premier League but looked a welcome addition for the Saints.\nHe was busy throughout his 45-minute appearance for a side who are without the attacking industry of Charlie Austin.\nAustin suffered a hamstring injury at the end of December and is not expected back until the middle of next month.\nForward focus\nAttack was clearly the focus for Brighton manager Chris Hughton during the transfer window, with the signings of Jurgen Locadia and Leonardo Ulloa.\nThe Seagulls have failed to score in nine of their past 14 games, winning just one and losing seven.\nThey broke their transfer record to sign Locadia from Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, while Ulloa has returned to them on loan until the end of the season from Leicester.\nLocadia is expected to need a few more weeks to recover from a hamstring injury that Brighton were aware of prior to his arrival.\nUlloa replaced Murray with 13 minutes remaining for the first game of his second spell.\nBut it was Murray who found the net for a second consecutive game, ensuring his side avoided equalling a club league record of seven consecutive away fixtures without a goal, set in 1934-35 and matched in 1956-57.\n'Well worthy of the point' - what the managers said\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"I think we were well worthy of the point that we've got. When you come here, with the way they play and the players they've got, you'd expect them to have good possession and threaten.\n\"But I think we restricted them to one half-chance or so. We had a lot of the ball and threatened ourselves, and we were resilient in what we did.\n\"We had very good opportunities once we got into that final third. So overall, I'm reasonably happy.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"I think in the first 15 minutes they were a little bit better in direct play. They won some second balls and from this situation we conceded a penalty.\n\"After the goal, we totally controlled the game, but we couldn't play quick enough to break through their defenders. Little by little they would drop and it was really difficult to find the space to create more chances.\n\"We were patient and well organised because I don't remember many actions from them, so in defence we controlled them well most of the time.\n\"In this situation, every single victory is massive, but we have to keep pushing and on Saturday we have another opportunity.\"\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\nMurray equals Premier League best - key stats\nGlenn Murray has equalled his best scoring season in the Premier League with seven goals, matching his tally in 2014-15 for Crystal Palace.\nThree of Murray's seven league goals this season have been from the penalty spot - only Sergio Aguero and Jamie Vardy have scored more penalties in the Premier League this season.\nJack Stephens registered his first ever Premier League goal in his 30th appearance.\nSouthampton have failed to win any of their 12 Premier League games since beating Everton in November.\nBrighton have picked up just two points in their past seven away Premier League matches.\nThe Saints have lost only one of their past 28 home Premier League games against newly promoted clubs, but all three of their matches this season have ended as draws.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday, with Brighton at home to West Ham on the same day (both 15:00 GMT)."

Imagine what he will be like when he is match fit - it's scary.\n\"A new partnership is born - Theo Walcott and Seamus Coleman down the right. That combination was really good.\"\nWalcott, 28, provided much more than goals, leading Everton's defensive press and winning possession seven times.\nEverton had registered only 25 shots on target in their previous 10 games under Allardyce, but they managed four against Leicester, all from Walcott.\nThe one question mark for Everton will be over another January signing, \u00a327m striker Cenk Tosun, who was dropped to the bench and did not feature.\n'Hopefully Mahrez will come back with a smile'\nIt was reported that Mahrez did not train with his Leicester team-mates on Tuesday before the trip to Goodison Park.\nThe news Manchester City had walked away from a deal because of the \u00a395m cost filtered through about 17:00 GMT, but Foxes manager Claude Puel said the uncertainty had not been a distraction.\nAlthough it was a victory to hold on to their talisman, Mahrez was badly missed in the first half as Leicester looked devoid of ideas in attack and struggled with Everton's high press.\nVardy cut an isolated figure up front, while the defence struggled in possession.\nLeicester did improve after the break and pushed for an equaliser after the penalty, but one shot on target is not a good return and they will hope Mahrez can slip back in for the visit of Swansea on Saturday.\nMahrez, who has scored nine goals this season, was named PFA Players' Player of the Year when Leicester won the Premier League in 2015-16.\n\"We will see with Riyad - perhaps there is some disappointment,\" Puel told Sky Sports.\n\"Hopefully he will come back quickly and with a smile and happy to play with us.

        "article_text": "Chelsea 0-3 Bournemouth\nBournemouth's three-goal victory at defending champions Chelsea is their \"best result\" in the Premier League, says manager Eddie Howe.\nSecond-half goals from Callum Wilson, Junior Stanislas and Nathan Ake secured the Cherries' first away win in seven league matches as Chelsea suffered their joint-heaviest loss of the season.\nThis is Bournemouth's third top-flight campaign - they beat Chelsea and Manchester United in 2015-16, Liverpool and Leicester in 2016-17 and Arsenal earlier this month.\nHowe has been managing the club since October 2012, his second spell in charge after a stint from 2009-2011 during which they were in the third and fourth tiers.\n\"That has to be our best result and the best performance in getting the result,\" said the 40-year-old Englishman.\n\"We were very aggressive and everyone was magnificent. Our aggressiveness, work-rate and endeavour - it all came together.\n\"Although it was a game of few chances, we deserved the victory and scored some great goals. We had to be at our best.\"\nWilson put the visitors ahead when he benefited from Tiemoue Bakayoko losing possession and exchanged passes with Jordon Ibe before finishing past Thibaut Courtois.\nWilson set up Stanislas for the second goal, before Stanislas' shot was turned in by Ake from close range as Bournemouth gained only their third win over Chelsea.\nThe Cherries move up to 10th while Antonio Conte's side, who signed striker Oliver Giroud from Arsenal for \u00a318m earlier on Wednesday, drop to fourth.\nWednesday's Premier League football analysis and reaction\nBrilliant Bournemouth pounce on Chelsea's weak defence\nBournemouth, who had not won away since a 1-0 victory at Newcastle on 4 November, deserved their win, punishing a Chelsea side that were unusually poor in defence to pull off one of the shock results of the season.\nA mistake from Bakayoko enabled Wilson to score his seventh Premier League goal of the season, and the Cherries nearly doubled their lead two minutes later when Lewis Cook shot just wide.\nChelsea had kept clean sheets in five of their past seven games, but there was no sign of that organisation when Wilson slid a pass through the middle of the home defence - with both Cesar Azpilicueta and Gary Cahill out of position - and Stanislas doubled the lead.\nJust three minutes later it was 3-0 as Stanislas was given space to shoot and Ake reacted fastest to divert the ball into the net.\nThe result matched Chelsea's defeat at Roma in the Champions League on 31 October, and was also the joint-heaviest defeat of Conte's two-and-a-half-year spell in charge.\nChelsea show their need for Giroud\nThe game came only a few hours after Giroud had moved from Arsenal, while Chelsea loaned Michy Batshuayi to Borussia Dortmund until the end of the season.\nHowever, Giroud's move was not completed in time for him to play, and with Alvaro Morata and Willian both injured, Conte went with a makeshift front three of Pedro, Eden Hazard and Ross Barkley.\nIt did not prove to be a successful selection - Chelsea did not have a shot on target in the first half and the ineffective Barkley, making his first Premier League appearance since a \u00a315m move from Everton, was substituted after 54 minutes.\nHazard, a constant threat, was at the heart of most of the hosts' attacking moves and they enjoyed a good spell just before half-time as Cahill and Marcos Alonso both headed narrowly off target.\nHazard and Pedro forced saves from Asmir Begovic in the second half, and Chelsea appealed in vain for a penalty when Pedro's header hit the arm of Ake at close range.\nBut the lack of a recognised striker was clear, with Conte later saying: \"I didn't see a centre-forward today.\"\nHe will hope Giroud will make the difference. During his five-and-a-half-year spell at Arsenal, the 31-year-old France international scored 105 goals in 253 games, but he has started only one league game in 2017-18.\nDiego Costa has been Chelsea's top goalscorer in the past three seasons, including their title wins in 2014-15 and 2016-17, but he returned to Atletico Madrid after Conte told him he had no future at the club.\nMorata, his replacement, started impressively with seven goals in his first eight games, but has only managed five in his 23 appearances since, leading Conte to bring in reinforcements.\nChelsea's unbeaten league run ends abruptly - the stats\nBournemouth scored three goals in a Premier League away game against a 'top six' opponent for the first time.\nChelsea had won seven of their previous eight home league matches before this.\nChelsea's loss was their first in nine league games (won five, drew three, lost one).\nChelsea had only conceded one goal in their previous seven home league fixtures.\nBournemouth have gone six league games without defeat since Christmas.\nBournemouth have beaten the reigning champions in each of the past three seasons: 1-0 at Chelsea in 2015-16, 1-0 at home to Leicester City in 2016-17 and this victory.\nAt 17 years and 84 days old, Callum Hudson-Odoi became the second-youngest player to make his debut for Chelsea in the Premier League, after Jody Morris in February 1996 (17 years 43 days v Middlesbrough).\nMan of the match - Callum Wilson (Bournemouth)\n'Bournemouth deserved the win' - what they said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"They deserved to win the game. We tried to do something but it was very difficult for us, even in the first half when the score was 0-0, we struggled a lot.\n\"[We struggled] for many reasons, but it's not important to speak about excuses, they deserve to win and we need to restart to work and to do our best. We have to accept it's a bad result and understand that we have to fight this season, if someone didn't understand this they don't understand football. Football is not simple.\"\nOn losing Andreas Christensen [who suffered a hamstring injury in the first half]: \"I don't think this affected the defence or the team, in other circumstances we play in the same way and win, I repeat today is a bad day, they deserve to win and we have to accept the result and bad mistakes.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was a game of few chances but we deserved the scoreline in the end. We were desperate for a clean sheet, the last few stages were difficult to watch as the lads tired and we just wanted to get those three points and secure the clean sheet.\n\"It's not a statement to other teams as such but more for ourselves, we've beaten Arsenal and Chelsea recently so if we needed any more belief then that has to come now.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth are back in Premier League action on Saturday, 3 February with a home game against Stoke (15:00 GMT).\nOlivier Giroud and Emerson Palmieri could make their Chelsea debuts on Monday, 5 February (20:00 GMT) when Conte's side take on Watford at Vicarage Road."

His calm, placed finish was also controversial, as replays showed Kane - who flicked the ball on to Alli in the build-up - was two yards inside the United half when kick-off was taken.\nNeither side paused for such controversy as each set about testing the opposing defence, with Lingard unable to fully gather the ball when well placed and unmarked, before Anthony Martial was only denied by a fine Ben Davies tackle.\nKane, seeking a 100th Premier League goal, twice fired tamely at David de Gea, and the relentless pace ultimately proved too much for Jones as he miscued a Trippier cross into the net.\nThis was a United defence that arrived in north London having kept six straight clean sheets.\nBut, in front of a Premier League record attendance of 81,978, they wilted at the key moments and were outrun by their hosts, who clocked 116km to the visitors' 108km.\nUnited boss Jose Mourinho pointed to confidence being \"totally broken\" after the second goal and his team simply could not find composure in the final third.\nIn a frantic game, moments of poise came from Eriksen and team-mate Mousa Dembele - the pair offering the best pass completion rates of any starting midfielder with 93% and 95% respectively.\nUnited had their chances, notably when Paul Pogba headed over before the break and Lukaku was denied by a Lloris save on 56 minutes.\nMarouane Fellaini was then substituted just seven minutes after coming on, the Belgian walking straight down the tunnel with a knee problem on a night of frustration for those in red.\nTheir advantage over Spurs is now down to five points as the fight for the top-four places heats up.\n'Perfect night' as Moura watches\nSpurs signed winger Lucas Moura from Paris St-Germain two hours before kick-off - and he was presented to the fans at half-time, walking to the centre circle before pointing to the sky with his eyes closed.\nManager Mauricio Pochettino called it a \"perfect night\" as business off the pitch complemented a complete display on it.\nIt is hard to see where Moura fits in, with Eriksen sublime on the right flank and Son Heung-Min a constant threat on the left. The Brazilian will know he faces a fight for a starting role as Spurs stepped up their level considerably from consecutive draws with Southampton and Newport County.\nEriksen's curled opener set the tone, and central defenders Jan Vertonghen and Davinson Sanchez nullified Lukaku; the shot count read 22-6 in the hosts' favour.\nThey were perhaps unfortunate not to be three up at the break - with Alli brought down by Antonio Valencia in the box - and Son and Kane dragged efforts wide after the break, while Eriksen smacked a 25-yard shot narrowly past the post.\nBut this was a timely success, taking their points haul to six points from a possible 18 against the league's so-called 'big six' before matches against Liverpool and Arsenal.\nThose games will go some way towards defining if Tottenham will again be among Europe's elite next season - and they will be tough to stop if they continue to play like this.\n'Mourinho got it wrong' - analysis\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Jermaine Jenas\nIt's been an unbelievable evening for Spurs.\nBefore the game I thought it would be end to end, but from the start United got worse and worse and just shrunk into themselves.\nSpurs were dominant all over the park, it's been that brilliant it's hard to pick out a single player.\nUnited lacked a competitive nature and Mourinho got it wrong. Lingard could be sacrificed for a midfielder that would protect Smalling and Jones, giving Pogba chance to go forward. They were wide open and Tottenham just enjoyed themselves.\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen\n'It starts with a ridiculous goal' - what the managers said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"Our aim is to be focused from the beginning. It was massive to be up early in the game. Three more points puts us in a very good position to fight for the top four. I'm sure Lucas Moura enjoyed that a lot.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"It's a performance that starts with a ridiculous goal. That goal after a few seconds has a big influence in the game because Tottenham can play the way they like to play. The second goal kills the team.\"\nKane shoots more than Man Utd - the key stats\nEriksen's goal was his 50th in all competitions for Spurs since joining in 2013 - second only to Kane at the club in that time (128).\nJones' own goal was the third Tottenham have benefited from in the Premier League this season - more than any other side.\nTottenham have won three successive home league games against United for the first time since September 1966.\nKane had eight shots (including blocked), two more than the entire United team. Only twice in his Premier League career has he had more shots in a game without scoring (10 vs Burnley in August and Brighton in December).\nLukaku has netted just 15 goals in 63 Premier League appearances against the 'big six' (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham) compared to 81 in 147 against non-big-six sides.\nUp next?\nManchester United host Huddersfield on Saturday in a 15:00 GMT kick-off, while Tottenham travel to Anfield to meet Liverpool a day later (16:30)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-0 West Bromwich Albion\nManchester City moved 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League by outclassing West Brom at Etihad Stadium.\nFernandinho slipped home a finish from Kevin de Bruyne's surgical through ball to put the hosts ahead during a dominant first-half performance.\nThere was no let-up after the break and De Bruyne rounded off a slick counter-attack by tapping in the second from Raheem Sterling's pass.\nSterling then set up Aguero for the third with a cute reverse ball in the last minute of normal time.\nWest Brom only mustered their first effort on goal in the 88th minute after on-loan striker Daniel Sturridge was brought off the bench for his debut.\nThe result means the Baggies remain three points adrift at the bottom of the table, after Swansea's win over Arsenal on Tuesday.\nCity underlined the gulf in class and league position between the two sides by carving out chance after chance, with De Bruyne and Aguero guilty of misses among 18 efforts on goal.\nOne possible blemish on the evening for the hosts is the prospect of retrospective action being taken against Fernandinho after the Brazilian escaped any punishment for planting his foot onto the thigh of the prone Grzegorz Krychowiak in the first half.\nHowever, West Brom were extremely fortunate that substitute Matt Phillips was allowed to see the match through to the final whistle after a thigh-high challenge on 18-year-old City substitute Brahim Diaz that only earned a yellow card.\nStylish Laporte catches the eye\nWith John Stones unwell and Vincent Kompany rested, defender Aymeric Laporte was brought in for an earlier-than-expected debut.\nHis club record \u00a357m move from Athletic Bilbao was only confirmed on Tuesday, but the Baggies provided the ideal opportunity for the 24-year-old centre-back to ease himself into Premier League life.\nHe had plenty of time to step into midfield and, under little pressure, prompt the attack. Of City's outfield starters, only Bernardo Silva was more accurate with his passing.\nSalomon Rondon's opportunities to test the Frenchman physically were few and far between, but Laporte gave as good as he got when the pair tangled in the second half.\nCentre-back is a position that has consumed much of City's cash and attention in recent years. The signings of Stones, Nicolas Otamendi, Eliaquim Mangala, Matija Nastasic and Stefan Savic have eaten up about \u00a3140m of the club's substantial reserves.\nTougher tests await but Laporte - the most expensive of the lot - did nothing wrong on his debut.\nWest Brom wilt in Etihad cauldron\nWest Brom came into the game on the back of three wins and a draw from their past four games, but their mini-revival never seemed likely to survive the Premier League's toughest assignment.\nAlan Pardew's side were penned back in their own half by near-constant City possession and pressure.\nTheir cause was not helped by Krychowiak hobbling to the sidelines in the wake of his skirmish with Fernandinho.\nBut their limits were summed up in the build-up to City's second as James McClean tried, and failed, to halt the counter-attacking De Bruyne with a cynical sliding challenge. As City celebrated, referee Bobby Madley showed the Republic of Ireland winger yellow.\nSturridge - back at the club where he began his career - showed some nice touches after 78th-minute introduction, freeing Phillips with a clever, scooped pass and shooting narrowly wide after springing City's offside trap.\nWhether his sporadic moments of high quality are what West Brom need for the relegation fight to come remains to be seen.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City)\n'Laporte's amazing, amazing performance' - what they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"Nice performance, top performance, deserved to win. Three more points.\n\"All season Kevin de Bruyne has played an outstanding level. If one of the best players runs like Kevin does, the rest follow him.\"\nOn Matt Phillips' challenge on Brahim Diaz: \"I just had a nice chat with the official. We have a different opinion, I understand what they say but I disagree. I said what I said, insisting the same. It is what it is. We can have different opinions but in the end always respect for what they do.\"\nOn Aymeric Laporte's debut: \"Yesterday he made the first training session, just passed the ball, but today we saw how good he is. He made an amazing, amazing performance. We are so happy for him.\"\nWest Brom manager Alan Pardew: \"We had one or two senior players missing tonight which was crucial for us. We could not find a way to hurt them.\n\"I thought our two strikers did really well tonight, as our keeper did. Daniel Sturridge is a poacher, he almost scored. He will hopefully be a big player we just want to keep him fit.\n\"Manchester City were outstanding at times tonight. As a manager I just said to the players hopefully we don't meet them too often.\n\"We know we have the quality to get out of trouble, we just need a little bit of luck, get the goals at the right times and have good game management.\"\nDe Bruyne ahead of Messi, Neymar and Ozil - match stats\nMan City have won their past 13 league games in a row against West Brom, their longest such run against a single opponent in their history.\nIndeed, this is also West Brom's longest losing streak against a single team in their league history.\nDe Bruyne provided his 38th league assist since his Man City debut in September 2015, at least four more than any other player in Europe's big five leagues (Lionel Messi, Neymar and Mesut Ozil with 34).\nSterling (14 goals, 6 assists) became the fourth Premier League player to have a hand in 20+ goals this season, after Mohamed Salah (25), Harry Kane (22) and Sergio Aguero (22).\nAguero has had a hand in 12 goals in 11 Premier League games against the Baggies (8 goals, 4 assists).\nWest Brom have won only one of their past 22 Premier League games on the road (D8 L13), winning 1-0 at Burnley in August.\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to Burnley in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off in the Premier League, while West Brom welcome Southampton in a 15:00 GMT kick-off on the same day."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 0-0 Watford\nStoke moved out of the bottom three after a meeting of the Premier League's two newest managers produced a low-quality stalemate with Watford.\nPaul Lambert's men kept back-to-back Premier League clean sheets for the first time since March last year, as captain Ryan Shawcross blocked from Abdoulaye Doucoure and the Hornets' Brazilian forward Richarlison missed from close range.\nWatford, under new coach Javi Gracia for the second time, also had to call on goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis, who denied Xherdan Shaqiri's fierce volley, and were thankful Mame Biram Diouf sent an early diving header wide.\nThe Potters, who introduced their \u00a314m new midfield signing Badou Ndiaye on the pitch at half-time, moved up two places in the table from 18th to 16th.\nA tight contest opened up in the last 15 minutes as both teams committed men forward in search of a winner, with substitute Peter Crouch going close for the hosts and Doucoure shooting wide.\nBut Gracia too can point to a strong defensive display from his new players, who had more possession than the home side and saw Barcelona loanee Gerard Deulofeu enjoy a lively debut.\nIntensity key but finesse required\nIntensity has been the buzzword of Paul Lambert's time at Stoke so far.\nHe spoke of its importance to the way he wants his team to play\n, external\nbefore this game, and repeated it afterwards.\n\"I want us to try to be on the front foot every time, not letting teams play if we can. We want to be energetic and enthusiastic for the game and we have a gameplan we want to stick to,\" he said.\nThere was plenty of energy on Wednesday, at times spilling over into aggression during a scrappy clash; Stoke collected four bookings, the visitors three.\nFor now the Scot may take solace that his team are buying into his essentials. They did enough to creep away from the relegation zone and continued to tighten up a defence that has conceded the most goals (50) in the league.\nThe addition of Ndiaye from Galatasaray will add further energy and bustle too.\nBut going forward Stoke require more finesse in front of goal to really pull away from danger.\nThe Potters had four shots on target, twice as many as the opposition, but only Shaqiri really tested Watford's stand-in keeper Karnezis.\nA promising debut for winger\nFrom Barcelona, via Goodison and Milan, Deulofeu - once a team-mate of Lionel Messi at the Nou Camp - got to answer that cliched question here: can he do it on a wet Wednesday in Stoke?\nThe answer from the 23-year-old was, on this evidence, yes.\nWatford signed the former Everton winger on loan from Barca until the end of the season on Monday, and a player who flattered to deceive at times during 62 Premier League appearances for the Toffees impressed on his return to England.\nHe is the first signing made by Watford since they appointed former Malaga boss Gracia earlier this month, and he made an instant impact with three key passes, some eye-catching footwork and several good deliveries from the right.\nRicharlison should have done better from a pin-point cross from the Spaniard in the first half, and near the end Deulofeu's quick feet sent him past Erik Pieters and Darren Fletcher to create another chance that Jack Butland saved from Roberto Pereyra.\nHe's quick too, running faster at one point than anyone else on the pitch at 33.93 km/h and could be a bold, creative outlet for a side struggling with its confidence.\nLambert getting basics right - the stats\nStoke City have picked up four points from their two Premier League games under Paul Lambert (W1 D1), as many as they had in their previous eight prior to his arrival (W1 D1 L6).\nAt least one team has failed to score in 11 of the past 12 league meetings between these two sides (15 goals total).\nStoke have gone five games unbeaten against the Hornets in the league (W4 D1) for the first time since April 1995 (run of six).\nAll six of Watford's Premier League managers have now failed to win their first game in charge of the club in the competition (D4 L2). Indeed, each of their past four, including Javi Gracia, have drawn their Premier League opener (also Quique Sanchez Flores, Walter Mazzarri and Marco Silva).\nWatford have failed to win any of their first four league games in a calendar year for the second consecutive year having also done so in 2017.\nGerard Deulofeu made his first Premier League appearance since he lined up against his current club Watford on the 10th of December 2016 while at Everton, 417 days ago.\nMan of the Match - Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford)\nWe might have lost it a few weeks ago - what they said\nStoke manager Paul Lambert: \"I thought they were better than us first half. And I thought we were better second half.\n\"But four points and two clean sheets is a good start for me and the team because it keeps the momentum.\n\"It's a game we might have lost a few weeks ago, but it probably wasn't a spectacle like the first game was (v Huddersfield).\n\"It's [Watford's] prerogative how they want to play. They are a hard team to play against because of the physical aspect to their game and they go pretty direct to their front lads, but the onus is on us to make the running.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia on Deulofeu: \"Gerard played well and made a big effort to create and add balance to our team.\n\"I am happy with his work and I hope he will improve as the level of the team does.\"\nWhat's next?\nStoke travel to Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00 GMT) while Watford host Chelsea on Monday (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Manchester City\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola refused to blame Raheem Sterling for his side's failure to beat Burnley after the England forward missed a glorious late chance to secure victory.\nWith City 1-0 up and less than 20 minutes away from their 23rd league win of the season, Sterling somehow failed to find the target from six yards after meeting Kyle Walker's cross at the far post.\nThat buoyed the home crowd, as did Sterling's substitution soon afterwards, and Johann Berg Gudmundsson levelled for Burnley with eight minutes remaining.\nClarets boss Sean Dyche felt Sterling's miss \"changed the feeling\" of the game though: \"The stadium erupted and everyone was with us. That started to grow.\"\nBut Guardiola insisted he did not take off Sterling because he had failed to score, and did not feel it was a decisive moment in the game.\n\"That is football,\" Guardiola said. \"Today Raheem missed one chance - it can happen.\n\"It was not the first time that someone had missed a chance and it was not just Raheem, it happened a lot in this game.\n\"When we arrived for the last action for a pass, a one-against-one or to dribble against the central defender and shoot, we were not able to do that.\n\"I am delighted with the way we played but you have to score goals and we were not able to do that, which is why we dropped two points.\"\nFootball Daily podcast: Is Sterling's miss up there with Rosenthal's?\nCity cannot turn their dominance into goals\nCity had taken the lead through Danilo's long-range strike, after Bernardo Silva teed the Brazilian up following a short corner, but failed to turn their dominance into further goals.\nBurnley had already seen Ben Mee and Aaron Lennon denied by Ederson when Gudmundsson struck.\nHe ran into the box to meet Matthew Lowton's cross with a powerful half-volley that City's Brazilian goalkeeper got a hand to, but could not keep out.\nIt meant City failed to win in the league for only the fourth time this season, allowing nearest rivals Manchester United to cut their lead to 13 points with a 2-0 win over Huddersfield.\nBurnley have now gone nine league games without a win, but the manner of their comeback to hold the runaway leaders will give boss Sean Dyche something to smile about after a disappointing start to 2018.\nCity did not have enough players for seven subs\nCity were chasing their 23rd win in 26 league games this season, and also trying to become only the third team in the Premier League era (after Manchester United in 2000 and Chelsea in 2006) to hold an 18-point lead at the top of the table.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger complained this week that competition in the Premier League is being destroyed by City's financial power but the memo has obviously not reached Dyche.\nHis Burnley side rode their luck at times, notably with Sterling's terrible miss, but were a threat throughout and got their reward at the end of the game.\nGuardiola had picked only six out of the seven permitted substitutes, because of a shortage of fit players and a reluctance to call upon his reserves, who played on Friday night.\nBut their failure to see out this victory was down to their sheer wastefulness, not any shortage of resources in their squad.\nAnd while Sterling had complained before the game that City were being \"butchered\" by bad tackles, the Clarets' wholehearted approach never got near to anything remotely resembling dangerous play.\nThe only challenge that might have irked Guardiola was a scything first-half tackle by Kevin Long on Ilkay Gundogan that earned the Burnley defender a booking.\nBurnley fans stay behind their team\nThe Clarets' current run is their worst since Dyche's side failed to win any of their first 10 Premier League games of the 2014-15 season following promotion.\nBut for the second time in four days, they rescued a point with a goal in the last 10 minutes, and it is clear the spirit that Dyche feels is a fundamental part of his side has not gone missing.\nHelped by a home crowd that showed nothing but support for their players, the Clarets did not play like a side struggling for form or appear short of any confidence.\nOnly Southampton (with 12 games before Saturday) are currently on a longer winless run in the top-flight than the Clarets, whose last victory came against Stoke on 12 December.\nHowever they have still picked up five points in that time, and remain on course to achieve Burnley's highest league finish since they finished sixth in 1974.\nMan of the match - Ederson\n'You can't all be glory. Not when you're us' - what they said\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola: \"Of course we are frustrated in terms of the result but the performance was outstanding against a Burnley side who are the most British of teams in terms of long balls and the way they play.\n\"But football is about goals. We needed to score the second, third and fourth when we had the chance. When you arrive in the last 15 minutes at Burnley 1-0, this is what can happen. I'm sad for the players because we played so well.\n\"What they have done this season, Burnley, is amazing. We controlled the game, but when we arrived in the last minutes at 1-0, there is danger.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"I was really pleased. City are a top-class side. We've been beaten 3-0 and 4-1 by them in our two previous games. We had to change something. We didn't really play with the quality needed in the first half.\n\"In the second half, City started really well and we had to dig in and do the ugly stuff. Then the confidence started to build. We started putting quality into their box, and in the end it was a fantastic ball and a fantastic goal.\n\"We don't dominate too many games with the ball so we've got to keep our shape. You can't all be glory. Not when you're us. You have to do the ugly stuff. But we still have some fine quality and we showed that with the goal.\n\"We're not saying we're the real deal but we're working hard to be better than last season and we're doing that.\"\nRare City slip, Danilo, Silva and Gudmundsson - match stats\nCity failed to win a Premier League game after scoring first for the first time in 26 matches, since a 2-2 draw with Arsenal in April 2017.\nBurnley have gone nine Premier League games without a victory (D5 L4), their longest winless run since November 2014 (10 games).\nCity have scored in 25 of their 26 Premier League games this season; only one side has scored in each of their first 26 (Arsenal in 01/02 on their way to netting in all 38).\nDanilo has netted two goals in the Premier League this season, equalling his best-ever return in a single campaign in Europe's big five leagues (two for Real Madrid in 2015-16).\nBernardo Silva has been directly involved in 10 goals in his last 15 appearances in all competitions for City (3 goals, 7 assists), this after scoring once and assisting just two more in his first 22 games for the club.\nJohann Berg Gudmundsson has been directly involved in seven Premier League goals this season (2 goals, 5 assists) - more than any other Burnley player.\nWhat next? City get a rest\nCity have seven days to recover before they host Leicester City next Saturday (17:30 GMT). It is only the third time this campaign they have not had a midweek match and other than through international breaks, it is their longest rest since the second weekend of the season. Guardiola says he is giving his players three days off. Burnley travel to Swansea (15:00 GMT) on the same day."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-0 Huddersfield Town\nAlexis Sanchez scored his first goal for Manchester United as they comfortably beat Huddersfield to send the visitors into the Premier League's relegation zone.\nAfter an uneventful first half, Romelu Lukaku gave United the lead on 55 minutes with a close-range volley.\nSanchez was then fouled by Huddersfield defender Michael Hefele to win a penalty and the Chilean, a January signing from Arsenal, stepped up to take the spot-kick.\nThe forward saw his low shot saved by Jonas Lossl, but made no mistake with the rebound to double United's lead on his home debut.\nIt was an emotional day at Old Trafford as United commemorated the 60th anniversary of the Munich air disaster with a minute's silence before kick-off.\nWith Premier League leaders Manchester City drawing 1-1 at Burnley in the early kick-off, second-placed United narrowed the gap to 13 points.\nBut it was a fifth successive league defeat for Huddersfield, who are without a win in eight league games and now sit 19th.\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho revealed after the game that Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini has had knee surgery and is expected to return by the end of March.\nRe-live Manchester United's victory over Huddersfield\nPogba dropped, but Sanchez makes his mark\nMourinho rang the changes after the 2-0 midweek defeat by Tottenham and the United team sheet raised a few eyebrows before kick-off.\nCentre-back Phil Jones, who scored an own goal at Wembley, was dropped from the matchday squad all together, while 21-year-old midfielder Scott McTominay was preferred to \u00a389m Frenchman Paul Pogba, who dropped to the bench for the first time since his return to the club in August 2016.\nAfter the game, Mourinho said Pogba had not been benched as punishment and felt it had not been a \"big call\".\n\"To sit on the bench one day is not the end of the world,\" the Portuguese said.\n\"The intention is not to punish anyone. To punish someone I also need someone to punish me because we are a team. I made a few changes thinking about the characteristics of this game.\"\nHe added: \"You have to open spaces by playing simple. That is why I played the kid [McTominay]. But Paul came on very well with a great attitude. No doubts for me, he is one of most talented midfield players in the world.\"\nUnited felt they should have had a penalty after 20 minutes, when Terence Kongolo clattered McTominay in the area, but referee Stuart Attwell waved away their appeals and the youngster continued after receiving treatment.\nDespite enjoying more than 76% possession, the home side lacked fluidity and creativity in the first half and failed to trouble Lossl, bar a long-range effort from Sanchez and an early attempt from Jesse Lingard.\nSanchez, making his third start for his new club, appeared to be getting more frustrated as the half wore on and he was booked for a petulant foul on Florent Hadergjonaj.\nUnited started the second half with real purpose and deservedly took the lead when Juan Mata's cross was met by Lukaku for the Belgian's 19th goal since joining the club.\nWith 25 minutes to go, Pogba eventually came on and United soon had their second before the game petered out.\nIn addition to the three points which keep United above Chelsea and Liverpool in the race for second place, Mourinho will be happy with a 15th clean sheet in the league this season for David de Gea.\nWorrying times for the Terriers\nThis performance was worlds apart from Huddersfield's 2-1 victory over United in October 2017.\nThey had defended admirably and frustrated United until Lukaku's breakthrough.\nThey tried to take the game to United on their rare counter-attacks but they failed to register a shot on target in the game and only one effort off target.\nThe Terriers were 11th in the table after the victory against United on 21 October, but have won only three times in the league since and taken just 12 points from a possible 51.\nUpcoming games against fellow strugglers West Brom, Swansea, Crystal Palace and Newcastle will be key to their survival hopes.\nMunich remembered\nSupporters observed a minute's silence before kick-off as United marked 60 years since the Munich air disaster.\nPlayers wore black armbands, while fans also received a commemorative book and pin.\nBefore the game, supporters were invited to pay their respects under the Munich plaque at the south-east corner of Old Trafford.\nOn 6 February 1958, a plane carrying Manchester United players and staff crashed at Munich airport with the club returning from a European Cup game against Red Star Belgrade.\nTwenty-three people died, including eight United players and three club officials.\nOn the actual day of the anniversary on Tuesday, there will be a service inside the stadium, with a minute's silence at 15:04 GMT - the precise time of the crash.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\n'We had to break down the Berlin Wall'\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"We always had control of the game, but at half-time it was 0-0. I guess we had around 85% possession in the first half but it was not enough. We kept doing the same in the second and even at 1-0 we were totally in control. Our defensive line was far from the danger areas.\n\"We had to be patient but had to keep the intensity high and the pressure. We had to break down the Berlin Wall organised so well by David Wagner.\n\"It was nice for Alexis Sanchez to win a match, the first at home. Nice for him to play well and show the desire and happiness in playing football. That is most important. It was not the goal of his dreams, but it is a goal.\n\"It is important for the bad reasons [Munich air disaster] but the memories stay. The club looks at the date and event as a key moment in the history of the club. It is nice to do that playing at home and winning.\"\nHuddersfield Town manager David Wagner told BBC Sport: \"It was a fair result, the better team won. We made it uncomfortable for them, we wanted to work and fight and stay together, that is what the players have done for a long period, but they used one of their chances and it was a deserved result.\n\"I have seen what I wanted to see, we will not have much of the ball and not create many chances, so I can live with what I have seen with the commitment and effort from the players. If we play like this, then I am sure we will see the results.\"\n'I fear for Huddersfield' - analysis\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day: \"Alexis Sanchez made the difference. He was the player who had the drive, energy, pace and aggression.\n\"It wasn't a great performance from Manchester United but it was a very good one from Sanchez. He was dragging his team forward with the pace of his play. He got the little bit of luck his performance deserved with the penalty round. He was their best player without a doubt.\"\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"Huddersfield have had a couple of tough fixtures. But they don't look like they're making any chances and we all know how important momentum is. There are other teams coming up around Huddersfield, and I fear for them.\"\nThe stats - Sanchez's foul day\nLukaku has scored in back-to-back Premier League games at Old Trafford for the first time since September.\nHuddersfield are the 20th consecutive team to lose their first Premier League visit to Old Trafford, since Derby County won 3-2 there in 1996-97.\nThis was the 15th clean sheet Manchester United have kept in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nThe Terriers failed to score for the 10th time in Premier League away games this season, more than any other side in the competition.\nSanchez has had a hand in nine goals in his last 10 Premier League games against newly promoted sides (eight goals, one assist).\nThe Chilean won seven fouls in this match - no player has been fouled more in a single Premier League game this season.\nWhat next?\nUnited travel to St James' Park to face Newcastle on 11 February (14:15 GMT), while Huddersfield have an FA Cup fourth-round replay against Birmingham on Tuesday (19:45 GMT), before hosting Bournemouth in the league on 11 February (12:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-1 Stoke City\nStoke manager Paul Lambert said he did not know how his side lost at Bournemouth - the Potters' first defeat since Lambert took charge.\nThe away side took the lead after five minutes when Xherdan Shaqiri headed in from debutant Badou Ndiaye's cross, but second-half goals from substitutes Joshua King and Lys Mousset gave Bournemouth the win.\n\"There's no way we deserved to lose that,\" said Lambert. \"We looked so comfortable I would have been disappointed to draw, let alone lose.\"\nStoke's Peter Crouch headed against the bar when it was 1-0, but Bournemouth scored twice in a nine-minute second-half spell to send the Potters back into the relegation zone.\nKing fired in a low equaliser after receiving a lucky deflection, before Mousset was left unmarked to head in from Jordon Ibe's free-kick for his first Premier League goal.\n\"I can understand the first goal - they had a bit of luck on the break with it coming off Joe [Allen],\" added Lambert. \"But there's no excuses for the second goal, it was unacceptable. It was really poor marking and if you don't defend set-plays you're in trouble.\n\"We looked really good, we had hunger and looked solid, but that second goal hurt us.\"\nStoke drop from 16th to 18th, while Bournemouth, unbeaten in seven Premier League matches, move up to ninth.\nAnalysis and reaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nRelive Bournemouth's win over Stoke City as it happened\nBournemouth show their fighting spirit\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe said their 3-0 win over Chelsea in midweek was their \"best win\" in the Premier League, and he will be delighted that his side showed their fighting spirit and desire to win here as they fought back to snatch another three points.\nThe hosts fell behind after only five minutes when Shaqiri, who had an earlier shot cleared off the line, was left unmarked to glance in a header for the opening goal and there was further bad news for the Cherries when Steve Cook went off injured after only 13 minutes.\nThat led to Howe making a tactical change as he replaced a defender with a forward, with King coming on and Bournemouth moving to a 4-4-2 formation.\nStoke performed well in the opening half hour, but the Cherries created the better chances after that and they grabbed a deserved equaliser in the 70th minute with King, who netted 16 times in the Premier League last season, scoring his first goal since 29 November.\nThey took the lead nine minutes later with Mousset, another substitute, finding space at the back post to head home his first Premier League goal, at the 23rd time of asking, following his \u00a35.4m move to Bournemouth in July 2016.\n\"We really had to dig deep and we have done that a lot, so that is a good sign for us,\" said Howe. \"We struggled to get into the game at the start, we didn't find rhythm. But the key thing is we conceded only one, and not two.\"\nDebutant Ndiaye impresses but Stoke throw it away\nFor Stoke, it was their first defeat in Lambert's three matches in charge and they will feel frustrated at conceding two goals within a nine-minute period in the second half.\nWhen Lambert replaced the sacked Mark Hughes in January, Stoke were 18th but picked up four points from two games to move up to 16th. However, this loss sees them fall back to 18th, with a worse goal difference than Newcastle in 16th and Swansea in 17th.\nOne note of encouragement for Lambert will be the debut performance of Senegal international midfielder Ndiaye after the 27-year-old joined in a \u00a314m deal from Turkish side Galatasaray on transfer deadline day.\nHe made an immediate impact as he swung in a fine cross from the left wing and an unmarked Shaqiri was able to glance a header into the net past ex-Potters goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.\nNdiaye also shot wide after linking up well with Peter Crouch and later fired an overhead kick past the post as he made an impressive start to his Premier League career.\nLambert was delighted with the performance of the new signing and said: \"Badou coming in was excellent. It's his first game in a fortnight, he's only trained once, but he managed 70 minutes and I'm delighted with his contribution. His performance was first class and he put in a terrific cross for the goal.\"\nCrouch, needing one goal to become the club's outright record Premier League goalscorer, hit the bar with a header when the score was still 1-0, and Bournemouth equalised shortly after, although King had a slice of luck as the ball rebounded into his path after a deflection.\nStoke have conceded the most goals in the Premier League, and despite two clean sheets in Lambert's first two games, a defensive error allowed for Mousset to head in the winner.\n\"It is basic defending for the second goal and we just switched off,\" said Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross.\nMan of the match - Badou Ndiaye (Stoke City)\nCherries complete the double over Stoke\nBournemouth enjoyed their first-ever league double over Stoke in their 13th season of meeting the Potters in league competition.\nStoke suffered their first Premier League defeat under Paul Lambert (won one, drew one), with that win under Lambert their only top-flight victory in their last seven (drew two, lost four).\nThe Cherries are unbeaten in seven Premier League games (won four, drew three), their longest ever run without a loss in the competition.\nNdiaye is the first player to register an assist on his Stoke Premier League debut since Shaqiri in August 2015.\nKing netted his 25th Premier League goal for the Cherries, seven more than any other Bournemouth player in the competition.\nIbe has been directly involved in four goals in his last five Premier League games (one goal, three assists), after registering just three assists (and no goals) in his previous 44 for the Cherries.\n'We've shown character' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"The two subs made a difference and it shows the quality in the squad. A goal's been coming for Lys (Mousset), he's a potential matchwinner so I'm really pleased he got his first goal. He and Josh King did well. They're talented players and are an important part of our future.\n\"The injury to our centre-half meant a change of system to make sure it wouldn't hurt us. We kept tweaking things during the game and it worked in the end.\n\"After the energy expended at Chelsea, it was pleasing for the players to go again and come back in the second half.\n\"A few weeks ago it was tough for us so it shows how quickly things can change. We need to use this momentum we've got and try to keep it going. After going four or five without a win, we've shown character to come back in the manner we have but there's a lot of the season to go.\"\nStoke manager Paul Lambert, on his hopes of staying in the Premier League, said: \"The dressing room was pretty quiet, like it should be when you lose. We played ever so well with and without the ball, but the second goal annoyed me the most.\n\"I'm still encouraged, that's the plus. We've got more than enough in our make-up to win games and the way we've been playing in my first three games, I'm really happy.\"\nWhat's next?\nStoke entertain Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday, 10 February (15:00 GMT), before Bournemouth play at Huddersfield Town the following day (12:00 GMT)."

We have lost the last seven here.\n\"We had a bad first half and then we corrected things. We did much better in the second half.\n\"We were planning to give more pace in attack with Wilfried Bony, but in the last 10 minutes Leicester were more organised in attack, and created more noise.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"I'm frustrated. It was a a good game against a tough team and they defended very well. I don't think it is a fair result and we have lost two points.\n\"We had to score more in the first half.

I know in my mind the most important thing is just to consider my team. I am disappointed about it all.\"\nLeicester's upper hand - the best of the stats\nJamie Vardy has scored the opening goal in six Premier League games this season - no player has done so more often (same as Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane).\nThe Foxes are unbeaten in their past 14 home games against Swansea in all competitions (W10 D4), since a 3-2 defeat in October 1950.\nAfter a run of seven consecutive away defeats in the Premier League, the Swans are unbeaten in their past three on the road (W1 D2).\nKi Sung-yueng - who provided the assist for Swansea's leveller - made his 155th Premier League appearance, overtaking Park Ji-sung as the South Korean with the most appearances in the competition.\nSwansea's equaliser came from their only shot on target in the match.\nLeicester have lost just one of their past seven home Premier League games, winning four and drawing two.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy\nWhat's next?\nSwansea host Notts County in their FA Cup fourth-round replay on Tuesday (20:05 GMT) before Burnley travel to the Liberty Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nLeicester will travel to the Etihad to take on leaders Manchester City in Saturday's late Premier League game (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 3-1 West Ham United\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton says his team will survive in the Premier League if they can replicate their performance in beating a lacklustre West Ham 3-1 at the Amex.\nThe Seagulls had not won a league fixture since 23 December but led when Glenn Murray raced clear to finish, only for Javier Hernandez to fire in and level.\nAfter a quiet start to the second period, Jose Izquierdo produced a moment of quality, curling into the top right-hand corner with his right foot from the angle of the penalty area, before Pascal Gross slammed a third from 20 yards.\n\"If we can put in more performances like this before the end of the season, then we'll be OK,\" Hughton told BBC Sport.\nHughton said Izquierdo's goal \"lifted the stadium\", adding: \"The most pleasing thing was that at 2-1 we could have been nervous and sat back on it but we didn't.\"\nRelive Brighton's fine performance\nBrighton were more vibrant throughout and rarely came under threat in the second period as they sealed a first league win in seven outings.\nThey climbed to 13th in the table, a place below West Ham. Both sides sit three points above the relegation zone.\nIzquierdo adds class to energetic Brighton\nDefeat ended West Ham's six-game unbeaten run in the league and they disappointed on the south coast.\nLining up with three central defenders and two deep-sitting midfielders in Mark Noble and Pablo Zabaleta, they offered sparse threat.\nDespite their record of one win in 14 league games coming into the fixture, Brighton played with an energy and confidence.\nGross consistently found space in front of the away defence, while left-back Gaetan Bong carried threat going forward, repeatedly offering his side an option.\nThis was the first time Brighton have scored three goals in a Premier League game since they won at West Ham in October. They could have scored more, with 21 shots on the day, only five of which found the target.\nHughton's side had only scored five goals in 13 league games before the match but Murray remains their go-to man. His calm finish set them on their way and, while he was replaced by January loan signing Leonardo Ulloa late on, it looks unlikely the 34-year-old will lose his place.\nHernandez's smart equaliser - firing in off the bar - briefly stifled the home side but Izquierdo's effort prompted wild celebrations and they never looked back.\nGross ruthlessly punished a loose James Collins pass with a crisp effort to effectively end the contest and the home side could have scored more, with substitutes Beram Kayal and Solly March going close.\nJust three points separate Watford in 11th and Huddersfield in 19th in the table, pointing to a chaotic relegation scrap.\nBut if Hughton gets his wish and his side find more displays like this, they stand every chance of beating the drop.\nHammers anger compounded\nDespite not seeing their side lose in the league since 23 December, West Ham's travelling fans aired their frustrations by regularly chanting \"sack the board\" in protest at what they perceive as a lack of spending in the January transfer window.\nIt has been a difficult week for the club. Defender Arthur Masuaku was banned for six games for spitting in last week's FA Cup defeat at Wigan, and West Ham sacked director of player recruitment Tony Henry for controversial comments on Friday.\nMurray's goal on eight minutes only added to their difficulties as they paid for a slow start, while their back three and defensive midfielders struggled to contain the movement of Gross and Anthony Knockaert.\nJanuary signing Joao Mario briefly looked like he may have an impact. The Brazilian smartly guided a flick into Hernandez for the equaliser and became more involved before half-time, when West Ham enjoyed their best spell.\nBut their intent ended there as they failed to create another meaningful opening after the break. Striker Jordan Hugill - signed from Preston for a reported \u00a310m on deadline day - appeared from the bench late on, when attacks were sporadic and timid.\nMoyes pointed to the \"world-class\" nature of Izquierdo's goal but said his side were not at their best.\nTheir haul of only four shots makes for tough reading on a day when they were well beaten.\nMan of the Match - Jose Izquierdo\n'As good as we've been' - manager reaction\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"We probably dropped our levels halfway through that first half. We were disappointed to go in at 1-1.\n\"Thankfully we got a very good reaction and the second half was as good as we've been in looking like scoring goals.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes: \"We've been on a good run recently and stuck at games, but we weren't really at the pitch of this game from the off.\n\"It was a world-class second goal and very difficult to stop. It showed that we had to field the same team again as midweek but Brighton played in midweek so it's no excuse for us.\n\"I'm a little bit frustrated by the transfer window - we needed a third player but didn't get that at the end. So I'm OK with bits of it, disappointed with other bits.\"\nHernandez the poacher - key stats\nWest Ham have lost four Premier League games in a season against newly promoted sides for only the second time (twice v Brighton, twice v Newcastle), after also doing so in 2006-07.\nGlenn Murray has scored five goals in his past seven appearances in all competitions for Brighton, as many as he managed in his previous 19 games this season.\nPascal Gross has been directly involved in 11 Premier League goals this season (5 goals, 6 assists), more than any other Brighton player.\nJavier Hernandez netted his 43rd Premier League goal, all of which have come from inside the penalty area. He is second only to Tim Cahill among players who have only scored goals from inside the box (56).\nUp next?\nBrighton face another relegation battle when they travel to Stoke next Saturday (15:00 GMT), when West Ham host Watford."

who handed Daniel Sturridge a full debut following his loan move from Liverpool - pushed for an equaliser but Southampton held on for a first Premier League win since 26 November.\nWest Brom remain bottom of the table, four points adrift of safety.\nRelive the action at The Hawthorns\nFootball Daily podcast: Is Sterling's miss up there with Rosenthal's?\nA big win at the bottom\nSouthampton's long wait for a victory had seen them fall to 18th despite taking draws in five of their last seven matches.\nPressure had begun to grow on manager Mauricio Pellegrino but victory sees his side climb four places to 14th, two points clear of danger.\n\"We needed this victory, for many reasons, but most important one is to believe what we can do on the pitch,\" Pellegrino said.\nThe win was a deserved one, with the visitors showing greater composure on the ball, particularly in midfield, and creating the majority of the game's best chances.\n\"Southampton looked like they had a little more energy and fresher players in the middle which showed,\" Pardew said.\n\"We had players who had been playing two games in three days and looked a little leggy.\"\nThe Saints' failure to convert more of the openings could have been costly, but they defended well in the final 15 minutes to deny the Baggies any meaningful chances.\nThe result is a desperate one for West Brom, who started the game with a three-point gap to 19th place and now see that increase by a further point.\nThey have now dropped 18 points from winning positions this season and have only won once in 12 league games since Pardew took charge.\nNew boys start but are not decisive\nEngland striker Sturridge, on loan at the Baggies until the end of the season, was not the only key January signing to make a full debut in the game.\nSouthampton's record signing Guido Carrillo, a \u00a319m arrival from Monaco, had made substitute appearances in the Saints' two previous games but the striker was given his first start at The Hawthorns.\nBoth Sturridge and Carrillo were lively before being substituted in the second half but it was Argentine who had the only shot on target from either player and could claim the better display.\nHe produced an excellent near-post run to meet a Ryan Bertrand cross with a header bound for the bottom corner before Foster intervened with a fine save.\nSturridge's best chance came in the first half when he was played in behind by Chris Brunt but he fired over.\nIn his 62 minutes on the pitch the 28-year-old showed some good link-up play with strike partner Rondon, but at times lacked sharpness - perhaps unsurprising since this was just his sixth league start this season.\nPardew even admitted afterwards that Sturridge is \"not quite on it at moment\", but it is clear he will be crucial if the Baggies are to avoid a first Premier League relegation since 2009.\n\"We've seen enough in training and bits today,\" Pardew added. \"If we had everyone available he may not have started, but it was a juggling act with the players today.\"\nStill a 'special day' for the Baggies\nThe game was West Brom's first at home since Regis' death last month.\nRegis was a pioneer for black footballers in the game when he played alongside Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson at The Hawthorns in the 1970s and 80s.\nHe scored 112 goals in 297 appearances for the club and was the third black player to be capped by England at the highest level, after his team-mate Cunningham and Nottingham Forest defender Viv Anderson.\nBefore kick-off a host of former West Brom players and managers, including Ron Atkinson and Bryan Robson, as well as other notable players such as Ian Wright, Andrew Cole and Dion Dublin, joined Regis' son Robert and his nephew, ex-West Brom striker Jason Roberts, on the pitch.\nFollowing a number of speeches, a video of Regis' career highlights, accompanied by Frank Sinatra song The Impossible Dream, was shown.\n\"It's a pity we couldn't get the result to match it and make the big man proud,\" West Brom midfielder Chris Brunt said. \"It's been a tough week for everyone at the club and such an unexpected thing to lose Cyrille. For the football club he's an icon.\"\nMan of the match - Mario Lemina (Southampton)\nBBC pundit Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"Mario Lemina was superb for Southampton. I criticised him at Wembley against Tottenham recently, when he was poor and maybe not fit.\n\"He looks fit now. He showed skill and endeavour. He made tackles. I liked the way he was trying to be progressive with the ball. He was powerful. It was the best game I've seen him play for Southampton.\"\nWest Brom's dismal run - the best stats\nWest Brom have picked up just one win from their last 24 Premier League games (D11 L12).\nSouthampton secured their first Premier League win in 13 attempts, having previously lost five and drawn seven.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2008, Chris Brunt has provided 31 assists from set plays, more than any other player.\nMario Lemina, who scored his first ever Premier League goal, is the third player from Gabon to score a goal in the competition after Daniel Cousin and Didier Ndong.\nAhmed Hegazi scored his first Premier League goal since netting on his debut in the competition back on the opening weekend versus Bournemouth, ending a run 24 games without one.\nJack Stephens has scored in consecutive league games for the first time in his career.\nJames Ward-Prowse has been directly involved in four goals in his last two away Premier League apps (three goals, one assist) as many as in previous 28 combined.\nAlan Pardew - who managed 64 games for Southampton in all competitions between August 2009 and August 2010 - lost his first home league match against the Saints as a manager (P6 W3 D2 L1).\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom's next league fixture sees them travel to Chelsea on Monday, 12 February (20:00 GMT) while Southampton play Liverpool a day earlier (16:30 GMT)."

That will be our challenge until the end of the season.\"\nAllardyce criticises 'pathetic' Everton\nAubameyang, a club-record \u00a356m signing from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, chipped in from fellow new arrival Henrikh Mkhitaryan's pass as the home side led 4-0 by half-time.\nTelevision replays showed the goal should have been ruled out for offside, although the visitors could hardly claim the decision made a huge difference to the match.\nEverton conceded three times in the opening 20 minutes amid defensive chaos, with Ramsey touching in the opener from Mkhitaryan's cross.\nLaurent Koscielny got in front of Aubameyang to head the second at the far post after Shkodran Mustafi glanced on Mesut Ozil's corner, before Ramsey scored a deflected third.\nAubameyang struck the fourth before half-time, prompting Everton manager Sam Allardyce to abandon his three-man central defence and revert to a back four.\nSubstitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed an Everton consolation from Cuco Martina's left-wing delivery, before Ramsey swept in his hat-trick goal from another low Mkhitaryan cross.\nWenger was pleased with Ramsey's showing, saying: \"He is calm in finishing. He used to rush it. Over the years, I think he can get 10-15 goals a season.\"\nHowever, Arsenal lost goalkeeper Petr Cech to a calf injury in a collision with Oumar Niasse as the striker hit the post in the second half.\nSaturday's Premier League round-up\n'We do not have any more players' - Guardiola on missing substitute\nFootball Daily podcast: Is Sterling's miss up there with Rosenthal's?\nAubameyang makes light work of debut\nIn normal circumstances, Ramsey's hat-trick would have guaranteed him the headlines, but Aubameyang's high-profile arrival during the week ensured he grabbed the attention.\nThe Gabon striker did much to lift the mood among fans despondent after Tuesday's 3-1 defeat at Swansea.\nAubameyang overcame a midweek illness to start against Everton - and his first display in Arsenal red was perhaps a sign of things to come.\nThere was a well taken goal, although it should not have counted, and a demonstration of his fearsome pace. In one first-half break he raced clear on to an Ozil pass and he was denied only by the knees of Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\nOn the flip side, there was also a hint of his individualistic streak - he did not seem too thrilled when Koscielny beat him to the scoring touch for Arsenal's second, throwing his arms out in front of him in an apparent gesture of mild frustration.\nHe can drift out of games too. He touched the ball 25 times during the match. No outfield player who started the game had fewer touches.\nHowever, if he can produce the kind of scoring form that marked his time at Dortmund - where he worked well with Mkhitaryan - Arsenal may yet reach the top four.\n\"It is very early, but they look to have the quality to integrate into the game we want to play,\" Wenger said. \"They are quick, have sharp movement and are agile and want the ball. It is very good and positive signs.\"\nThree is not the magic number\nSam Allardyce's 500th game as a Premier League manager was ruined as a decision to start with a three-man central defence backfired spectacularly.\nHis Everton side lacked defensive discipline as they made only three tackles in the first half, while players were frequently caught out of position.\nAllardyce's plan appeared to be to shut out the home side centrally while using Jonjoe Kenny and Cuco Martina as attacking wing-backs.\nIt would have been a big enough test for a defensive line-up used to playing together. In a line-up containing one debutant - Eliaquim Mangala - and two other defensive changes from the previous game, it was a recipe for calamity.\nThere were far too many gaps between the central defenders, while neither Kenny nor Martina seemed to have any idea as to how close they were supposed to stay to the back three.\nMangala, signed on loan from Manchester City on Wednesday, had a dreadful debut: he was dragged all over the place as Mkhitaryan crossed for Ramsey's first, and it was his deflection that took Ramsey's shot beyond Pickford for the third goal.\nArsenal could have had more than four before half-time, as Nacho Monreal headed against the post from a Granit Xhaka corner.\nEverton were better once they switched to a 4-4-1-1 formation for the second half, with Tom Davies on for Michael Keane, but never had a hope of recovery.\nIt was a miserable return to Emirates Stadium for Everton winger Theo Walcott, signed from Arsenal in January. He had one first-half chance from a Niasse flick through, but Mustafi - a former academy player at Goodison Park - made a goal-saving challenge.\nMan of the match - Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Arsenal)\n'Everton were embarrassing' - analysis\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day: \"Arsenal were brilliant and they could have scored six or seven goals.\n\"From an Everton point of view, if ever there was an example of football coming back to bite you, it was this - after Sam Allardyce suggested in his press conference before the game that Arsenal's defence was weak.\n\"Everton were all over the place. They were embarrassing. They were hopeless defensively in the first 45 minutes.\"\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"Arsenal's new boys did really well. Mkhitaryan was the star of the show. I don't think he got the chances he should have done at Manchester United.\n\"Aubameyang showed great pace and calmness considering it's a big deal when you make your debut. It was a really clever finish for his goal.\n\"When Arsenal play like this, they can beat anybody. They just don't play like this away from home.\"\nAubameyang the eighth - key stats\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang became the eighth player to score on his Premier League debut for Arsenal, after Steve Bould, Kevin Campbell, Freddie Ljungberg, Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Thomas Vermaelen and Alexandre Lacazette\nArsenal are only the second team to lead by four or more goals at half-time in consecutive Premier League home games, after Manchester United (against Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday in November 1997)\nArsenal-Everton is the highest-scoring fixture in Premier League history (151 goals), with Arsenal's 105 against the Toffees a record for one team against another in the competition\nThe Gunners have beaten Everton 96 times in league competition, more than one side have beaten another in Football League history\nAaron Ramsey has been directly involved in 101 goals for Arsenal in all competition (53 goals, 48 assists).\nThis was Sam Allardyce's 500th Premier League match as a manager - only Harry Redknapp (238) has lost more games than him in the competition (196)\nWhat's next?\nArsenal have a Wembley derby against Tottenham in the Premier League next Saturday (12:30 GMT).

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle United\nManager Rafael Benitez felt Newcastle were victims of a \"soft penalty\" decision as fellow strugglers Crystal Palace came from behind to earn a draw.\nMohamed Diame had turned home Kenedy's corner at the back post midway through the first half for the visitors.\nBut Luka Milivojevic earned Palace a point with a second half penalty after Ciaran Clark was penalised for pulling Christian Benteke's shirt.\n\"He was pushing my player and my player was pulling,\" said Benitez.\n\"We cannot do it, but I can see a lot of penalties not given. We then changed everything because obviously they had more confidence and they were pushing, we knew that they have very good players up front. We needed to be strong in defence and it was difficult.\"\nFormer Newcastle striker and manager Alan Shearer also questioned the penalty decision on Twitter.\n\"If that's a penalty then there should be 10 penalties per game,\" he wrote.\nBut speaking on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, former Premier League striker Steve Claridge felt the decision was much clearer.\n\"You can just see the shirt being pulled. Yes, it's a penalty. It's a definite pull on the shirt. Absolutely. A stupid, stupid thing for Clark to do.\"\nThe point lifted Palace up to 14th, with Newcastle remaining 16th but a point clear of 18th-placed Stoke.\n\"It will have to be sufficient for me,\" said Palace manager Roy Hodgson. \"The referee gave the penalty and I am just happy we scored it this time - the rules of the game prevent people from pulling shirts.\"\nDaylight for Palace\nIt probably should have been all three points for the home side who had more than 62% of the possession and 14 shots in the second half.\nPalace had also started strongly and Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow had to be alert to save from Wilfried Zaha and Benteke in the first half.\nBut they will have to settle for a three-point cushion above the relegation zone with 12 games remaining after Milivojevic's fourth goal in eight games.\n\"The way we were playing in the first half I would certainly have taken (a point). After watching the second half and watching us dominate the game as we did, I feel we were unlucky not to have got all three points in the end because our second half performance merited that,\" said Palace manager Hodgson.\n\"It's a point that doesn't help either of us enormously but we've just got to make sure that when we can't win, we draw.\"\nPalace have lost only three of their 17 league matches since a 1-0 defeat at Newcastle in the reverse fixture in October.\nAnd with that turnaround coinciding with Hodgson's arrival in September, it is the first time Palace have enjoyed clear daylight above the bottom three.\nBut despite being fouled for the penalty, Benteke has now failed to score in all 11 of his league appearances at Selhurst Park this season.\nThe Belgium striker did, though, provide a constant threat against the Magpies and was only denied breaking that home drought by Clark's 89th-minute block.\nBenteke also linked up well with his teammates, and with new signing Alexander Sorloth an unused substitute, the striker clearly remains a key element in Palace's survival bid having scored in the midweek draw with West Ham.\nBacks to the wall for Newcastle\nNewcastle had to dig deep to avoid what would have been just a second defeat in six games, with the visitors indebted to goalkeeper Darlow and defender Clark.\nClark was at fault for the penalty with a clear tug on Benteke spotted by the assistant referee, but equally his block from the Belgium striker ultimately secured what could be a crucial point at the end of the season.\nNewcastle's opener was slightly against the run of play as Ayoze Perez applied a crucial touch to help Kenedy's corner on for Diame to sweep home.\n\"We did well coming here and getting one point. We were controlling the game in the first half, the three offensive players they have, we did well in defence,\" said Newcastle manager Benitez.\n\"We had a couple of chances and the counter attack early in the second half could have changed everything. We needed to defend a little bit better.\"\nDiame's finish was Newcastle's first goal in the opening 45 minutes since the now departed Henri Saivet found the net at West Ham on 23 December.\nNewcastle could have gone 2-0 up just before half-time as Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey blocked from the lively Kenedy on his second appearance for the club, before making a flying save to turn away Perez's effort not long after.\nBut from that point in the 32nd minute until a late flourish, Newcastle did not register a shot at the Palace goal.\nNew signing Islam Slimani was not selected due to an ongoing thigh injury, while striker Dwight Gayle has now not scored in his last 14 league appearances.\nMissed opportunity for Palace - what they said\nCrystal Palace goalscorer Luka Milivojevic: \"Honestly I'm not happy with the point, after all the chances that we created and missed, in my opinion we deserved two (more) points.\"\nNewcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow: \"First half we were very good and had a lot of chances, played some good football, second half they came back at us and we did well to hold on to a draw.\n\"We've shown we have got a lot of fight and can hopefully get out of this relegation battle.\n\"It was a sloppy five, 10 minutes from myself that could have been better. We have a lot of grit and desire and will go to the very end.\"\nMan of the match - James McArthur (Crystal Palace)\nMilivojevic is spot on - key stats\nCrystal Palace have lost just once in their last 10 home Premier League games.\nNewcastle have collected just two points in their last eight away Premier League games in the month of February.\nLuka Milivojevic is Crystal Palace's top scorer in the Premier League this season with six goals, and the Serb has netted five goals in his last 10 appearances in the competition.\nOnly Andy Johnson with 11 has scored more Premier League penalties for Crystal Palace than Milivojevic.\nPalace have conceded the opening goal of the game in 17 different Premier League games this season, no team has conceded the first goal more often.\nSeven of Newcastle's 24 Premier League goals this season have been scored via corners, the highest percentage in the division.\nOnly Everton with seven have taken more penalties in the Premier League this season than Palace, and no side have conceded more penalties than Newcastle with five.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Goodison Park to take on Everton on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Newcastle have an extra day to prepare for the visit of Manchester United to St James' Park (14:15 GMT)."

allowing Kane, who had missed an earlier penalty, to score his 100th Premier League goal and leave the home fans enraged.\nSalah's third-minute goal, scored after he intercepted Eric Dier's poor back pass, gave Liverpool a lead they held until 10 minutes from time when Spurs substitute Victor Wanyama lashed keeper Loris Karius' punched clearance back into the top corner from 25 yards.\nIn a dramatic finale, Karius saved Kane's penalty after he brought down the striker, paving the way for Salah to weave his way into the area before lifting a finish over Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris at the start of five minutes of stoppage time.\nAnd after Moss awarded Kane a second opportunity from the spot, the England international placed his penalty into the bottom-right corner.\nIt was a fitting end to a thriller and a result which will bring more satisfaction to Spurs as defeat would have left them five points adrift of Liverpool in the race for a place in next season's Champions League.\nLiverpool remain third in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Tottenham in fifth.\nAnalysis: The away display Spurs have been waiting for\nRead more: Angry Klopp fumes after Kane penalty\nFrustration for Liverpool and Klopp\nWhen manager Jurgen Klopp set off on a sprint of triumph along the touchline in front of Anfield's giant Main Stand as Salah put Liverpool back in front in injury time, he thought he was celebrating a win that was opening up a crucial five-point gap between his side and Spurs.\nInstead, minutes later, he was left to reflect on the concession of a late equaliser that left Anfield enveloped in frustration.\nLiverpool's much-maligned defence had held firm for so long, but Klopp's switch to three at the back, when he sent on Joel Matip for James Milner in the final quarter of an hour, did not have the desired effect.\nSpurs played on Liverpool's nerves, although Karius, who remains an inconsistent presence, could hardly have expected his punch - when perhaps he should have caught - to be returned into the top corner of his net with such spectacular interest by Wanyama.\nLiverpool, and indeed Anfield, were suddenly on edge but relieved when Karius saved Kane's lame penalty.\nThen came that dramatic exchange of goals in a chaotic finale and the points were shared.\nLiverpool offer so much that is good when it is measured in goals and excitement, but that nasty habit of carelessness and conceding crucial goals has still not been cured.\nAnfield's fury at late twist\nLiverpool's supporters were waiting to celebrate a vital victory after Salah's twisting, turning run into the area in stoppage time ended with a clever finish over the onrushing Lloris.\nIt came just after Kane had missed the chance to give Spurs the lead from the spot when his uncharacteristically poor penalty was saved by Karius.\nAnd yet the cheers stuck in the throats as referee Jon Moss - who entered lengthy consultation with his assistant before finally awarding the first Spurs penalty - waited as Van Dijk tangled with substitute Lamela, looking towards his colleague once more before pointing to the spot.\nThe Kop exploded in fury but Kane stayed calm and made no mistake the second time, beating Karius comfortably.\nKlopp was desolate as he was locked in conversation with fourth official Martin Atkinson.\nThere was barely time to restart the game and Anfield instantly vented its anger on Moss after awarded Spurs two penalties in front of the Kop.\nOnce the drama had subsided, this was a fair result between two teams who mix high quality, intensity and attacking intent with moments of vulnerability - leaving the top four chase as tight as ever.\nSpurs in show of resilience\nSpurs could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Eric Dier's carelessness let in Salah as early as the third minute, instantly evoking memories of their struggles when visiting other teams in the so-called \"big six\" in recent years.\nMauricio Pochettino's side have not won away in the league against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United in 11 game stretching back to a 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium in February 2016.\nAnd yet they can take massive encouragement away from Anfield after the manner in which they kept their composure and played their way back into contention after Liverpool dominated the first half.\nSpurs kept probing and even when Salah's second looked to have condemned them to certain defeat - seemingly even more of a blow after Kane's missed penalty - they gathered themselves for one late push that earned another spot-kick and a point.\nPochettino's players have been accused of fluffing their lines on occasions like this in recent times. Here they deserve great credit.\n'We would have won if it wasn't for those decisions'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"There were so many situations to talk about but the ref's decisions decided the game so I can't help but talk about them.\n\"I don't understand either of the penalty situations. The first one was offside and the second, I know already what the ref and his assistant will say. There was a touch, a little touch. But Lamela has jumped into him and wanted the touch and to go down.\n\"If the ref kept playing at that level then fine, but in the first half he wasn't giving fouls. Then for the softest touch of the whole game he decides it is a foul.\n\"In the second half we had to defend like crazy, they had to chase the game. We had counter-attacks, the high pressure was good and we put in some super crosses.\n\"We were a bit unlucky here and there but we had enough chances to win the game. And we would have if it wasn't for those decisions.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was an amazing game to watch - two teams that always try to play exciting football.\n\"I was calm because the team plays so well. The feeling is we dropped two points. We were much, much, much better than Liverpool.\n\"Both were a penalty and it is not controversial. Sometimes people complain about the referee, but when they are right it is good to tell everyone.\n\"It was important, the character. When you analyse the game, it was always under control despite conceding the first goal. When you analyse the 90 minutes, Tottenham were much better.\n\"We always try to give our best. The team always shows personality and character. Today was a game we played for the win, and to change history you need time.\"\nTottenham striker Harry Kane after scoring his 100th Premier League goal: \"I was nervous before the second penalty. It was a big moment, with a lot of pressure, but I stuck to the routine.\n\"There was a lot of pressure, in front of the Kop. The first one, I did everything I wanted to and the keeper made the save. You've got to take the chances. I thought the second one was a penalty; the defender took out Lamela.\n\"The gaffer said at half-time: Play a bit quicker. We created some chances. Victor Wanyama scored a great goal, and if I scored the first penalty we probably would have won it. But there we are. I've had a good season in front of goal so let's see how many I can get now.\"\nKane and Salah's records - the best of the stats\nKane has scored 100 goals in the Premier League in 141 appearances - only Alan Shearer (124) reached that mark in the competition in fewer games\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 15 league games at Anfield (W8 D7), the second longest current run in the competition, after Manchester City (25 games)\nTottenham have won only two of their 26 games at Anfield in the Premier League (8%)\nSpurs are winless in their past 11 away games against 'top six' opponents in the league (D5 L6), and have won only one of their 19 such games under the Argentine (D7 L11)\nSalah has netted 21 goals in 25 games in the league, the fewest appearances of any Liverpool player to reach 20 goals in the competition\nSalah has also been directly involved in 27 goals in the league this term, the joint most of any player in their first 25 appearances for a club in the competition\nThe Egyptian is only the second Liverpool player to score 20 or more goals for the club in his debut Premier League campaign, after Fernando Torres in 2007-08 (24)\nSalah's opener after two minutes 16 seconds was Liverpool's quickest goal in the Premier League since April 2016, when Daniel Sturridge scored inside two minutes against Newcastle United (1min 7secs)\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Southampton for next Sunday's late Premier League kick-off (16:30 GMT).\nTottenham host Newport County in their FA Cup fourth-round replay on Wednesday (19:45), and return to league action on Saturday in the North London derby against Arsenal at Wembley (12:30)."

        "article_text": "Watford 4-1 Chelsea\nWatford scored three late goals to make manager Javi Gracia's first home game an \"unforgettable night\" and increase the pressure on his Chelsea counterpart Antonio Conte.\nThe Blues played an hour with 10 men after Tiemoue Bakayoko's red card capped a dreadful individual 30-minute performance - in which he gifted Watford four chances.\nThe Hornets - who had won only one of their previous 12 Premier League games - led controversially as Gerard Deulofeu went down easily under keeper Thibaut Courtois' challenge and Troy Deeney scored the penalty.\nChelsea, who brought on Olivier Giroud for a debut in the second half, scored an undeserved equaliser when Eden Hazard curled home brilliantly from 25 yards.\nBut, two minutes later, Daryl Janmaat scored a fantastic goal of his own when he cut in from the right wing, played a one-two with Roberto Pereyra and beat another couple of defenders before scoring with his weaker left foot.\nDeulofeu added another when he ran from halfway before his shot was deflected home by Gary Cahill - and Pereyra scored a fourth from Abdoulaye Doucoure's through ball.\nThe Hornets are now six points above the relegation zone.\nGracia, who replaced Marco Silva last month, told BBC Sport: \"It was a great victory and a great match. I am very proud of my players.\n\"We played a good match, pressed high. The match changed after the sending-off but I think we played very well. Chelsea are a very big club, a big team.\"\nIt was Chelsea's second consecutive defeat by three goals in the Premier League, following their 3-0 home reverse against Bournemouth.\nWonderful Watford fully deserve win\nWatford had earned just six points from 12 games since late November, with Silva losing his job and being replaced by Gracia - who lost to Southampton in the FA Cup and drew 0-0 at Stoke in his opening two games, both away from home.\nThey were excellent from the start against the defending champions and merited all three points.\nThey had plenty of chances to score before and after Deeney's opener, which came when Deulofeu was clipped by Courtois and threw himself to the ground. Gracia's side should have been out of sight before Hazard's strike looked set to rescue a late point.\nAs well as the four gifts from Bakayoko, Deeney missed a sitter from eight yards, and Richarlison, Doucoure and Jose Holebas all forced saves from Courtois.\nFor a team in such bad form, many may have expected a collapse after Hazard's equaliser against the run of play - but it galvanised the hosts for a phenomenal final eight minutes.\nJanmaat restored their lead brilliantly, before the lively Deulofeu - on loan from Barcelona - scored a fine individual goal moments later.\nPereyra's goal was also impressive, running onto Doucoure's through ball before taking Cesar Azpilicueta out of play with his first touch and lashing past Courtois.\nIs time running out for Conte?\nBefore the game, Conte took the unusual step of asking the club to release a statement backing him - following their heavy home loss to Bournemouth.\nIf it was not coming before the Watford game, it is highly unlikely to come after it.\nHaving won the Premier League in the Italian's first season in charge, Chelsea are fourth and battling for the final Champions League place this term. They are one point above fifth-placed Tottenham.\nTheir fans were annoyed with referee Mike Dean for what they felt was a harsh Bakayoko second booking and a perceived dive for the penalty - but Chelsea were very poor and deserved nothing from the match.\nThe visitors were shambolic at the back at stages - and only had three shots on target, all in the final 10 minutes. Cesc Fabregas, who replaced Willian following Bakayoko's red card, forced a save just before Hazard's beautiful goal from outside of the box.\nWith Alvaro Morata still out with a back injury, Conte decided to start with Hazard as a false nine.\nFormer Arsenal striker Giroud came on in the 64th minute and he only had two chances - one blocked and one saved by Orestis Karnezis in injury time with the game long gone.\n'If my work is not enough Chelsea have to take another decision'\nBakayoko's half-hour to forget\nBakayoko's opening half-hour was so bad Chelsea fans could have been excused for thinking they would be no worse off following his red card.\nHaving been responsible for one of Bournemouth's goals, he followed that up with an even worse performance.\nEarly on, the France international passed the ball to Deulofeu, who overran the ball back to Courtois.\nBakayoko then headed the ball straight at Doucoure's chest and the Watford player shot wide from the edge of the box.\nThe \u00a340m summer signing from Monaco was then dispossessed before the ball broke to Deulofeu, who shot into the side netting - and Richarlison had a shot blocked by Cahill after Bakayoko had given the ball away.\nBoth his yellow cards came after he lost the ball too.\nFirst of all he gave the ball to Etienne Capoue and then pulled him down in the 25th minute. And five minutes later he miscontrolled the ball to Richarlison and fouled the Brazilian while stretching to try to win it back.\nIn all, he had 28 touches, losing the ball seven times, and failing with four of his attempted 12 passes.\nMan of the match - Gerard Deulofeu (Watford)\nMatch stats - Chelsea's worst double result since 1995\nChelsea have now lost more league games this season (six) than they did in the entire 2016-17 campaign (five).\nThe Blues have lost consecutive Premier League games by a three-goal margin for the first time since October 1995 (4-1 v Manchester United, 3-0 v Blackburn).\nWatford earned their first win in any competition against Chelsea in 14 attempts (D3 L10) since a 1-0 win in September 1999.\nGracia is the first Watford manager to win his first home Premier League game in charge of the club.\nHazard scored his first Premier League goal against Watford - Huddersfield are the only side in this season's competition he has faced but not scored against.\nAll three of Deeney's Premier League goals this season have been penalties against 'big six' sides (Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea).\nThree players have now received red cards for fouls on Richarlison this season - Davinson Sanchez, Jonathan Hogg and Bakayoko - more than any other player in the division.\nChelsea have been shown seven red cards this season, two more than any other Premier League side.\nPereyra is the fourth player to both score and assist a Premier League goal from the bench this season, after Morata against Burnley, Anthony Martial for Manchester United against West Ham and Andre Ayew of Swansea against Huddersfield.\nWhat's next?\nWatford visit West Ham in the league on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off), while Chelsea play again next Monday - at home against West Brom (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Arsenal\nHarry Kane is \"the present and the future\" of Tottenham according to manager Mauricio Pochettino, following the striker's match-winning display in Spurs' 1-0 win over Arsenal.\nKane's towering header deservedly settled the north London derby at Wembley as Spurs' surge towards an end-of-season place in the Premier League's top four gathers momentum.\nHe soared high above Laurent Koscielny in the 49th minute to direct a Ben Davies cross beyond Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech and move Spurs up to third in the table.\nAnd it was only the defiance of Cech that kept a rampant Spurs at bay in the second half, producing a collection of outstanding saves to somehow keep Arsenal in contention as Pochettino's side threatened to run riot.\n'Are Spurs now the Premier League's best of the rest?'\nIt was a performance that almost earned outplayed Arsenal an unlikely point only for substitute Alexandre Lacazette to waste two last-gasp opportunities, the second when he was clear through on Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris but shot wide of the far post.\nSpurs survived the scare - and such was their domination after the break that it would have been a travesty had Arsenal escaped Wembley, hosting a Premier League record attendance of 83,222, with a draw.\n\"Harry Kane is not old fashioned, he is the present and the future,\" said Pochettino after it was suggested that the winning goal was one typical of a centre-forward. \"We are so proud that he is in our side.\"\nSpurs' recent form, which includes a 2-0 win over Man United and a 2-2 draw with Liverpool at Anfield, drew praise from their Argentine manager.\n\"I congratulate our players, we've had three massive games and it was an amazing performance.\"\nRelive the action from Wembley\nYour combined Tottenham and Arsenal XI\nSpurs make top four statement\nTottenham were slow to get into their stride in a first 45 minutes characterised by Arsenal's defensive discipline - but once they moved through the gears the Gunners simply could not live with them.\nIt was only the outstanding Cech that stood between Arsenal and a second-half rout as Spurs simply swamped their opponents after the break with a formidable display of power, pace and sheer intensity.\nSpurs, at least until Liverpool play Southampton on Sunday and Chelsea meet West Bromwich Albion on Monday night, have now moved into third place in the Premier League and right to the heart of the battle for places in next season's Champions League.\nAnd on current form, having beaten Manchester United in equally impressive fashion here in their last home league game and performed with such measure and authority to earn a point at Liverpool last weekend, Spurs are making a strong case to be the best of the rest after runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nJose Mourinho and Jurgen Klopp would mount their own arguments against that but this was Tottenham's third powerful statement in less than a fortnight and the perfect preparation for this week's exacting Champions League last 16 meeting with Juventus in Turin.\nOnce the cobwebs of a lack-lustre first half were blown away, Spurs were irresistible and Arsenal were simply unable to cope with the power of Mousa Dembele in midfield and the creation and running of Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli - combined with the inevitable goalscoring prowess of Kane.\nThe days when there was talk of Spurs suffering a Wembley curse seem an age away after another hugely impressive display from Pochettino's team.\nAnother bad day for Arsenal's big guns\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger knew victory was essential here to build on the foundations of last week's 5-1 demolition of Everton and also to keep up the pursuit of a place in the top four.\nAnd for 45 minutes at least Arsenal stood firm and were well-drilled and defensively organised, giving Spurs very little joy apart from a Kane header from Eriksen's cross which went wide.\nThe promise shown by Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - admittedly against an Everton defence that was almost the equivalent of an open goal - did not get the chance to flourish here because of a combination of poor service and poor performance.\nMkhitaryan had a nightmare before being replaced by Lacazette, anonymous for the most part and wasteful when in possession, while Aubameyang had little chance to show the pace and power that is his trademark.\nAubameyang hinted at what he could offer when he showed a fierce turn of pace to escape Davinson Sanchez early on but was barely seen after that.\nIronically it was Lacazette, seemingly pushed down the order by their arrival, who had those two key chances late on and missed both.\nWenger turned away holding his head in anguish after he squandered the second of those opportunities when clean through on Hugo Lloris - but it would have been a point Arsenal did not deserve.\n\"It will be more difficult to finish in the top four but we have to fight for it,\" a rueful Wenger reflected afterwards.\n\"The first goal was key and we conceded it. Kane made the difference, that's what he's about. I have seen the replay, it is no foul, just good centre-forward play. We can only look at ourselves.\"\nArsenal are now six points adrift of Liverpool, who have a game in hand, in fourth place and they must find a way to better employ their new attacking weaponry against the Premier League's better sides if they are to recover their position.\nNo stopping Harry Kane\nKane was not quite at his ruthless best in this North London derby - so it is testament to his persistence, character and quality that he was the match-winner once again.\nThe 24-year-old was unusually wasteful in front of goal in the first half when he directed Eriksen's cross wide with the goal at his mercy and the striker also sent a stooping header wide after soaring to score the decisive goal.\nHe also saw a powerful volley blocked by Cech, so even when not quite touching his usual heights, he could - and perhaps should - have scored more goals.\nThe England international has now scored seven goals in seven Premier League north London derby games - only Emmanuel Adebayor, with eight, has more.\nKane is quite simply one of Europe's finest strikers. And how Spurs and England will benefit from it.\n'Kane's got the lot' - Analysis\nMatch of the Day pundit Danny Murphy:\nKane is fantastic, a big-game player. His all-round game is phenomenal. In the first half he was the one opening Arsenal up. He had the bit between his teeth. It was like he was so up for the game.\nHe has got the lot and is so physically fit and strong. He was the match winner and the difference generally.\nMan of the match - Petr Cech (Arsenal)\nGoal-hungry Spurs - the stats you may have missed\nMauricio Pochettino's side have scored in their last 15 Premier League games - the longest current run in the division.\nSpurs have kept a clean sheet in consecutive home league games against Arsenal for the first time since September 1975.\nPetr Cech has now gone nine Premier League games without a clean sheet, his longest ever run in the competition.\nMeanwhile, this is Arsenal's longest run without a Premier League clean sheet (9 games) since a run of 11 ending in February 2002.\nThe Gunners have lost three consecutive away league games for the first time since a run of four in April 2017.\nIn meetings between 'big six' sides in the Premier League this season, no side has won more points in home games than Spurs (nine - W3 D0 L1).\nWhat's next?\nSpurs' next Premier League outing is on Monday, 26 February away to Crystal Palace at 20:00 GMT. Arsenal do no return to league action until Thursday, 1 March when they host Man City at 19:45."

        "article_text": "Everton 3-1 Crystal Palace\nManager Sam Allardyce believes Everton are \"getting it right\" at Goodison Park after a quick-fire start to the second half helped them beat Crystal Palace.\nAllardyce faced criticism for what he labelled a \"pathetic\" display in a 5-1 defeat at Arsenal last time out but against the Eagles his side delivered a committed and controlled performance.\n\"I was apprehensive today after being done 5-1 away from home but the players have responded magnificently,\" said Allardyce, 63.\n\"In the eight home games I have been here, we have picked up 17 points and conceded just four goals.\n\"We are getting it right, entertaining the fans and getting the result,\" added Allardyce after his side earned only their second win in nine league games.\nRelive Everton's win at Goodison Park\nEverton edged a competitive first 45 minutes but nearly went behind in added time when Palace striker Christian Benteke headed the best chance of the half wide.\nBut they added end product to their endeavour after the break, with Gylfi Sigurdsson driving home via a deflection and Oumar Niasse guiding in a headed second less than six minutes after the break.\nBenteke and debutant Alexander Sorloth each almost got Palace back into the game with headers but it was the home side who continued to dictate play and Tom Davies sealed the win from six yards.\nAllardyce lost defenders Eliaquim Mangala and Seamus Coleman to injuries but even when Luka Milivojevic punished an Ashley Williams handball from the penalty spot, Palace never looked like creating a frantic finish.\nThe Eagles were simply bettered on Merseyside and now sit 14th, just two points above the relegation zone.\nSigurdsson proves a point\nSome Everton fans called for Allardyce to be sacked less than three months into the job after the defeat at Arsenal but this display offered the sort of desire that is more likely to strengthen his position.\nFacing his former club, Allardyce's impact at half-time was clear. He was seen demanding that his side get the ball forward more quickly shortly before the interval and their opening goal arrived when goalkeeper Jordan Pickford rushed to send a long ball upfield within a minute of the restart.\nNiasse fought for the scraps - as Everton did all day - allowing Sigurdsson to drill home from 25 yards.\nThe timing of the goal was key as it prevented any frustration from home fans setting in and Sigurdsson now has 17 goals from outside the box since he arrived in the league in 2012 - more than any other player.\n\"It looked like Sigurdsson had a point to prove as he was left out last week,\" said Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy.\n\"Sometimes he stayed wide and attacked the full-back, sometimes he came into the number 10 role. He grew in confidence. He's calm around the box and I really like him.\"\nRooney's deep influence\nSigurdsson played alongside Theo Walcott and Davies in support of Niasse in a 4-2-3-1 formation as Wayne Rooney sat in a deep role alongside Idrissa Gueye.\nRooney has only been switched to the role in recent weeks but his intelligence was evident throughout as he retained possession smartly, while Walcott looked a constant threat as he saw more of the ball than any home player, with 64 touches.\nThe loss of Mangala and Coleman aside, this was a wholly positive day at the end of a tricky week. Every player in a blue shirt contributed and the Toffees move up to ninth.\n\"The Everton fans will wake up and be happy to see where we are, only two points off seventh,\" Allardyce added.\nLack of adventure from Palace\nThis was the first Premier League fixture to pit two former England managers against one another since the late Bobby Robson's Newcastle took on Kevin Keegan's Manchester City in 2004.\nAnd while it was Palace boss Roy Hodgson who arrived with momentum - after just two defeats in 15 league games - his side never looked keen on taking risks.\nSorloth - signed for \u00a39m from Danish side FC Midtjylland - was used up front but when Palace lost the ball he was asked to track back down the left flank, creating a 4-5-1 formation when out of possession.\nThe new signing applied himself to the task and made more tackles than anyone in the away side. But his role meant Benteke was isolated and the Belgium forward's two headed misses - one with the game goalless and one when 2-0 down - were crucial.\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Pat Nevin described the second effort as a \"very bad miss\" and the wasted opportunity left any Palace recovery looking unlikely.\nThey bettered the shot count with 16 efforts on goal but many were from range and there was simply not enough adventure about the away side against opponents who came into the fixture under scrutiny from their own recent failings.\nA two-point cushion between them and the bottom three looks a slim margin as the Eagles' next five games see them face Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea, Huddersfield and Liverpool.\nMan of the match - Wayne Rooney\nBig day for Niasse - key stats\nNo team have won more penalties than Crystal Palace this season (seven), with Luka Milivojevic scoring more goals from the spot than any other player in this campaign (five).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in seven goals in his past six Premier League starts against Crystal Palace - he has scored three and assisted four goals.\nTom Davies scored his first goal for Everton since 9 April 2017 against Leicester, 307 days ago.\nOumar Niasse both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career.\n'We are getting it right' - Manager quotes\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce: \"We have shown what we can do and hopefully we can improve for the rest of the season.\n\"We have to look at our own record and that is where the mainstay of our season lies. In the eight home games I have been here, we have picked up 17 points and conceded just four goals. The unfortunate away form is causing us the problems.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"The first half we were good value, certainly for 0-0, and we were confident we could keep going but the early goal in the second half puts you on the back foot.\n\"We played some reasonable football but it was difficult to get back after 2-0. It was a sterling effort from the players and the way they went about their business. We have to accept we were beaten.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides have a week off because they are out of the FA Cup so Everton travel to Watford next on 24 February in a 17:30 GMT kick-off. Crystal Palace host Tottenham on Monday 26 February in a 20:00 kick-off."

We want to keep improving.

Today we didn't create clear chances.\"\nGracia and his players will be relieved that their next two games are at home.\nMan of the match - 'He scares defenders'\nMatch of the Day pundit Danny Murphy:\nI felt when Arnautovic played in wide areas at Stoke he spent too much energy tracking back. David Moyes has recognised to play him up front. What he gives them is a presence, thev've lacked that. He can see a pass, dribble and score a goal. He's had time out but looked sharp.\nHe scares defenders and they look a different team when he's playing.\nHome and away - the stats\nWest Ham have gone five games without defeat at the London Stadium in all competitions for the first time.\nWatford are winless in their past seven Premier League away games, failing to score on five occasions in that run.\nJavier Hernandez has scored in three of his past four Premier League games for West Ham (three goals), as many as he had scored in his opening 17 this season (four goals).\nThe Hammers kept their first clean sheet since December (3-0 at Stoke), ending a run of eight games in which they had conceded.\nWhat's next?\nBoth West Ham and Watford have two weeks to prepare for their next league games as they have both been knocked out of the FA Cup. Both face Merseyside opposition next in the Premier League.\nThe Hammers travel to Anfield to face Liverpool on 24 February (15:00 GMT), while Watford entertain Everton on the same day (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 1-1 Brighton & Hove Albion\nStoke manager Paul Lambert said he would not blame individuals after his side had a late penalty saved in a draw with Brighton at the Bet365 Stadium.\nThe relegation-threatened Potters were awarded a 90th-minute spot-kick when referee Bobby Madley judged Jese Rodriguez had been fouled by Dale Stephens.\nCharlie Adam picked up the ball, prompting a frustrated Jese to complain about not being allowed to take it, and Adam's effort was saved by Brighton keeper Mat Ryan.\nSeagulls defender Lewis Dunk reacted fastest to push the loose ball behind for a corner.\nLambert, whose side had cancelled out Jose Izquierdo's opener via a Xherdan Shaqiri strike in the 68th minute, said: \"I'm devastated for the players.\n\"When you get a penalty in the last minute it's a big opportunity to win the game. But the penalty's a lottery, a hit or a miss.\n\"I would be more concerned if everybody shied away from a penalty and didn't want to take it.\n\"That's when the problems arise. But they wanted to take it. They wanted to win the game, which is normal, but they also want to score.\n\"Who is to say Jese would score? Nobody knows.\n\"I would never blame anybody. It is not a blame culture. We win as a team and we lose as a team.\n\"Charlie felt good because he scored the last one. He scored against Coventry [in the FA Cup last month] and has a great left foot.\n\"If you ask Charlie to put a ball anywhere he'll do it. It's just in that moment, the goalkeeper has made a save.\"\nBrighton deservedly led a game in which they attacked with more fluidity, typified by Izquierdo's superb first-half opener after quick passing between him and Stephens.\nBut Shaqiri's sixth goal of the season sparked a fightback for Lambert's men, who also saw Mame Biram Diouf's header cleared off the line by Anthony Knockaert in added time.\nThe draw is not enough to move Stoke out of the bottom three and they remain 18th, with the Seagulls staying 13th.\nRelive the action from the Bet 365 Stadium\nStoke must sharpen their attack\nFrom the panic of trailing in a game against another bottom-half club, to the relief of levelling, the elation of a late penalty and finally despair at missing it.\nStoke and Lambert went through the emotional wringer during a game in which their faltering attack had them largely second best.\nThe Potters had more possession but missed a big opportunity to move out of the bottom three and go level on points with the Seagulls when that last-gasp penalty was saved.\nThe late flurry in added time came during a contest when Stoke's front three of Shaqiri, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Diouf only touched the ball in Brighton's area a combined six times. They struggled badly to create good chances and work Ryan.\nBut it was not all negative; January signing Badou Ndiaye had another impressive game after his assured debut at Bournemouth, making more successful tackles and winning back possession more times than any team-mate.\nBefore that late onslaught, Shaqiri's goal had been their only shot on target.\nHard life on the road but Seagulls still impress\nBrighton have found life on the road tough during their first season in the Premier League.\nThey are now without an away league win in eight games since November's 1-0 triumph at Swansea.\nThe Seagulls have still only scored seven away goals this season, the joint fewest in the division with bottom club West Brom.\nBut statistics don't always tell the full story when it comes to performances. Hughton's side were highly impressive against Stoke and in Izquierdo they have one of the top flight's most in-form midfielders.\nHis sumptuous goal, after bursting forward and exchanging clever passes with Solly March and Stephens, comes after an equally eye-catching strike in the win against West Ham last weekend.\nHe could have had a hat-trick today but for the instincts of Butland, and his pace troubled Stoke throughout.\nBrighton host Swansea City next in the league who are one point behind them in 15th.\nShaqiri shines once again - the stats\nShaqiri has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time in his career.\nShaqiri has had a hand in each of Stoke's past three Premier League goals, scoring twice and assisting once.\nStoke are unbeaten in their past 17 home games against Brighton in all competitions (W9 D8 L0) since losing 1-0 in a second tier match in September 1961.\nBrighton are unbeaten in three successive league games for the first time since November (W1 D2).\nThe Potters have missed their past three penalties in the Premier League, with each taken by a different player - Charlie Adam, Saido Berahino and Marko Arnautovic.\nBrighton have scored in consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since November, after a run of six games without a goal on the road.\nIzquierdo has been directly involved in four of Brighton's past seven Premier League goals (two goals, two assists).\nMan of the match - Jose Izquierdo (Brighton)\n'We were a different side in the second half' - what they said\nStoke City manager Paul Lambert speaking to MOTD: \"It's really disappointing not to come away with the win. In the second half we were excellent, and after getting the penalty, it's especially tough to take.\n\"I changed the system at half time and it helped us out, it looked like we were a different side in that second half. Brighton are a difficult team to play against but it's still a good point for us.\"\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton speaking to MOTD: \"At this moment we feel like it's probably two points dropped, against a good Stoke side, who are in good form. I thought we had the better chances, but in a player like Xherdan Shaqiri, there's always that quality to get a goal.\"\nOn the penalty decision: \"I certainly felt it was not a penalty, but it was a great save by Mat Ryan. It was incredibly soft, you've got two players holding each other, if anything my player is pushing him away and the Stoke lad has gone down very easily. I think it's very, very harsh.\n\"But saying that, both the save and the tackle were excellent, and we needed Mat Ryan again to make a save straight after from the corner. If you ever need a reason for players following up a penalty, Lewis Dunk has showed why with that tackle.\"\nWhat's next?\nStoke travel to Leicester City on Saturday, 24 February (12:30 GMT), while Brighton host Coventry City in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday, 17 February."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-0 Burnley\nSwansea City edged further away from the Premier League relegation zone as Ki Sung-yueng's late strike gave them a significant win over Burnley.\nA meeting between two of the division's four lowest-scoring teams was predictably light on clear-cut chances, with the game's first shot on target not materialising until Johann Berg Gudmundsson's second-half effort was saved by Lukasz Fabianski.\nBurnley looked the likeliest victors for much of the game but the introduction of Swansea's club-record signing Andre Ayew inspired a stirring finish from the hosts.\nAfter his brother Jordan Ayew was denied by the visitors' keeper Nick Pope, the Swans continued to press for the winner, which Ki supplied with a powerful low drive from the edge of the penalty area.\nVictory moves Swansea up to 15th in the table - two points clear of the bottom three - and extends their unbeaten run to nine matches.\nBurnley, meanwhile, are still without a win in 2018 but remain seventh in the table.\nSwans' resurgence continues\nSwansea have been revitalised by the arrival of manager Carlos Carvalhal, who has lost only one of his 11 games since taking charge in December.\nDuring that period the team have played with greater fluency and purpose, while Carvalhal has lifted spirits on and off the field with his eccentric turns of phrase and spontaneous acts of kindness, such as handing out Portuguese custard tarts to journalists in his media conference before this fixture.\nEven one of Carvalhal's quirky analogies, however, would have struggled to illuminate this goalless first half.\nSwansea had managed only 19 goals in their preceding 26 league fixtures and they struggled to trouble a Burnley defence which had conceded just 23, the fourth best record in the division.\nForward Andre Ayew came on in the second half for his first appearance since rejoining the Swans from West Ham for a club-record \u00a318m, possibly rising to \u00a320m.\nHis introduction and that of striker Tammy Abraham gave Swansea the presence in Burnley's penalty area they had previously been lacking, and prompted a sustained spell of pressure from the hosts.\nAbraham's flick-on set up Jordan Ayew for an instinctive close-range effort which was saved by Pope, and that chance in particular appeared to spur the home side on to push for the winning goal.\nIt arrived after some fine work from right-back Kyle Naughton, who wriggled into a promising position on the outskirts of the Burnley box before passing to Ki, whose rasping low drive whistled into the bottom corner.\nBurnley's difficult 2018\nAlthough Burnley have defied the odds to sit in seventh, they have endured a trying start to 2018.\nSean Dyche's men had failed to win their past nine games in all competitions, albeit with a creditable draw against Manchester City in their latest outing.\nThe Clarets made an assertive start at a rain-sodden Liberty Stadium but, for all their energy and industry, their attacks were limited to long-range efforts such as Sam Vokes' which went wide.\nThe visitors shaded the early parts of the second half as well, with Fabianski tipping Berg Gudmundsson's half-volley over the bar and Ben Mee heading wide from a free-kick.\nBut when Swansea increased the tempo in the closing stages, Burnley had no answer.\nThey remain seventh - still exceeding expectations - but a 10th game without victory will be a cause for concern for Dyche and his players.\nMan of the match - Jordan Ayew\n'We put all the meat in the grill'\nSwansea boss Carlos Carvalhal, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am very happy with my players, very proud of them, they are doing fantastic work. They follow 100% the strategy we create, very professional.\n\"We blocked them, we started creating problems and as you know during the game I was not happy because we wanted to win, we felt we really wanted to win which is why as a manager I can start to risk and put more players in attack.\n\"We put in Andre Ayew, Tammy Abraham; we had three attackers in the middle. We put all the meat in the barbecue, all the meat inside the grill, because we wish a lot to win the game. I am very happy because that created a big impact.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a tight game - there was nothing in it really. There was action in both boxes but we were not nearly as good as we have been of late. We were a bit huff and puff today, and it feels like the injuries are beginning to take their toll.\n\"Their goal was a bit of a stuffy one. We didn't clear our lines at the corner and it had a few deflections. The pitch is pretty tricky here, and it wasn't great for either side.\n\"But the reality is that a team that eight games ago had nowhere near this kind of endeavour, with the crowd not behind them like they were today, suddenly they have those things. When a new manager comes in, sometimes that is the way it goes.\"\nStats - Swansea second on the form table\nBurnley's winless run in the Premier League now stands at 10 games - the longest current streak in the division (drawn five, lost five).\nOnly Tottenham (15) have won more Premier League points than Swansea (14) since Carvalhal took charge of the Swans.\nKi scored his first Premier League goal since May 2016 at West Ham, ending a run of 37 games without one in the competition.\nSwansea have won their past three home games in the Premier League, after winning just two of their opening 11 this season.\nSwansea have won all three of their Premier League home games against Burnley - the only side they have a 100% record against in the competition having played them more than once at the Liberty.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea travel to Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday (12:30 GMT), before a trip to Brighton on 24 February in their next league game.\nBurnley are out of the FA Cup and their next match is not until 24 February when they host Southampton.\nMore to follow."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 5-1 Leicester City\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola said striker Sergio Aguero \"deserves all the credit\" for his side's 5-1 win over Leicester after scoring four second-half goals.\nThe Argentina international took his tally to 13 in 10 games in 2018 with another display of deadly finishing, aided by a brilliant performance by Kevin de Bruyne, who set up his side's first three goals\nGuardiola, who saw his side win their 13th home game of the season to move 16 points clear at the top of the Premier League table, said: \"Sergio fought hard and he is so important to us.\n\"We played quite similar to the way we played in our draw against Burnley last week, but the difference here was we took our chances.\"\nLeicester winger Riyad Mahrez, who almost joined Manchester City at the end of January, received an ovation from both sets of fans as he returned from his self-imposed exile to make an appearance as a second-half substitute.\nWhether Mahrez's move to Etihad Stadium is resurrected in the summer remains to be seen, but this display from Pep Guardiola's side showed that they can cope pretty well without him - especially with De Bruyne and Aguero in this form.\nRelive Manchester City's victory over Leicester City\nDe Bruyne leads the way with assists\nDe Bruyne now has 14 Premier League assists this season, four more than his team-mate Leroy Sane.\nThe Belgian's first of the game came when he picked out Raheem Sterling at the back post to put the home side ahead in the third minute, with Sterling converting from almost an identical position to where he had missed against Burnley last weekend.\nLeicester, playing with five at the back and using Jamie Vardy's pace on the break, did not roll over and levelled when Nicolas Otamendi's mistake let the England striker in to score.\nBut Manchester City resumed control with two goals in the space of five minutes at the start of the second half.\nAnother brilliant De Bruyne cross put the ball on a plate for Aguero to fire home from close range and the pair combined again soon afterwards, with De Bruyne slipping the Argentine clear to score with a powerful finish.\nAguero, who has now scored in seven consecutive home games at Etihad Stadium, was not finished yet and helped himself to his fourth goal with a dinked finish from Schmeichel's disastrous clearance.\nAnd he completed the scoring with his best goal of the night, collecting the ball from substitute Phil Foden on the edge of the area and finding the net via the underside of the bar.\nAguero firing Man City nearer to the title\nSergio snapshot:\nAguero has scored in seven consecutive games at the Etihad Stadium in all competitions (14 goals) for the first time in his Manchester City career, including two hat-tricks in his last three games.\nThis was the third time Aguero has scored four or more goals in a single Premier League match, more than any other player in the competition's history.\nAguero is the fourth player to score 20 plus goals in four consecutive Premier League campaigns - after Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry (five) and Harry Kane.\nInjuries mean City lack attacking options at present - their three forward players on the bench against the Foxes, Lukas Nmecha, Foden and Brahim Diaz are all teenagers.\nBut Aguero has not ducked the responsibility handed to him since Gabriel Jesus was injured against Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve and his form since then has been devastating.\nThe 29-year-old now has 21 Premier League goals for the season and, although he remains 12th on the all-time PL scorers list, he is now only one behind Robin van Persie and three off Teddy Sheringham who are immediately above him.\nWith De Bruyne pulling the strings, Aguero will not lack chances to add to his tally although he will have to wait for his next opportunity in the Premier League.\nBecause they are in FA Cup and then the Carabao Cup final, this was Manchester City's last league game of the month.\nTheir next one is against Arsenal, also their opponents at Wembley, at Emirates Stadium on Thursday, 1 March.\nBy then, second-placed Manchester United could have closed the gap to 10 points if they win their next two games, but on this evidence, City fans will still have little to worry about.\nPuel: \"We are stronger with our best players in the team\"\nMahrez returned to training on Friday after a 10-day absence that had seen him miss two games following the breakdown of his move to Manchester.\nThe Algerian started the game on the bench but was brought on for Fousseni Diabate after 62 minutes, with his side 3-1 down.\nHe made only nine touches in the opposition half and made little impact, but his involvement made it clear that his manager Claude Puel has no intention of ostracising him.\nPuel said afterwards: \"The most important thing is that he came back to the training session, to the game.\n\"I said it was important he came back quickly so he could come straight back into the squad and of course we are stronger with our best player.\n\"He got on the pitch and worked hard. He showed he had a good fitness. Now it is important to look forward and put this behind us, with the next games coming up.\"\nVardy, a big game player - the stats\nManchester City have won 23 of their 27 Premier League games so far this season (drawn three, lost one), as many as they had in the entirety of 2016-17 in 38 matches.\nBoth of Manchester City's two quickest goals in the Premier League this season have been scored by Raheem Sterling (38 seconds v Watford and 125 seconds v Leicester City).\nSince making his debut for Werder Bremen in August 2012, Kevin de Bruyne has provided 77 assists in the big five European leagues - more than any other player in that time. The next best is Barcelona's Lionel Messi with 76.\nLeicester City striker Jamie Vardy has scored in each of his last four Premier League games, his longest streak since his record 11-game run in Leicester City's title winning season.\nVardy is the first ever player to score against each of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham in the same Premier League season.\nWhat next?\nManchester City are in action in the Champions League on Tuesday with the first leg of their last-16 tie with FC Basel in Switzerland (19:45 GMT) and return to domestic duty on Monday, 19 February with their FA Cup fifth-round tie at League One leaders Wigan, which is live on the BBC (19:55 GMT).\nLeicester are also still in the FA Cup and host Championship side Sheffield United on Friday."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 4-1 Bournemouth\nHuddersfield produced \"one of the performances of the season\" as they brought their five-match losing streak in the Premier League to an end with an emphatic home victory over Bournemouth.\nThe Terriers started the game in the relegation zone for the first time this season, but climbed out thanks to a fine performance which left manager David Wagner looking optimistically to the future.\nHuddersfield face teams in the bottom half of the table in six of their next seven league games.\n\"It was a huge win for us,\" said Wagner.\n\"Now it's time to build up momentum against opponents which are in front of us, against whom we are more competitive.\n\"We said before the game that this is massive for us and that after losing at Old Trafford we had the difficult fixtures behind us.\n\"It was one of the performances of the season.\"\nHuddersfield play Tottenham at Wembley on 3 March, but it is more likely to be fixtures against West Brom, Swansea, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Brighton and Watford that decide their fate.\nThe compact nature of the bottom half was illustrated later on Sunday, when Newcastle's 1-0 win over Manchester United lifted them clear of the bottom three and into 13th place.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nHow the game was won\nAlex Pritchard's first goal for Huddersfield - scored by sweeping in Steve Mounie's cut-back on his second start since joining in January - put the Terriers ahead after just seven minutes.\nBournemouth replied quickly as Junior Stanislas guided a delicate low finish just inside the post after collecting Ryan Fraser's cross, but the home side then took hold of the game.\nWhen Mounie nodded his team back in front from Aaron Mooy's free-kick, Huddersfield had scored as many goals in 27 minutes as they had managed in their previous seven league matches.\nTom Ince should have added a third but badly missed the target with a header from about six yards out, before breathing space finally came via an own goal when Mounie's first-time shot was deflected in by Steve Cook.\nMidfielder Mooy was carried off on a stretcher after suffering a knee injury in a 50-50 challenge, with Wagner confirming after the game that the Australian had suffered no serious damage.\nAfter Pritchard was brought down in the box in stoppage time, Rajiv van la Parra converted from the spot to add further gloss to a vital win.\nBournemouth's club record run of seven matches unbeaten in the top flight ended with a first defeat since 23 December, and they stayed 10th.\nRelive Huddersfield v Bournemouth\nSeven down, five to go?\nHuddersfield were above Manchester City on goal difference after their first three games of the season, and they ended 2017 in 11th. But all the recent signs pointed to a difficult day ahead.\nFor the first time this season their weekend began in the relegation zone. Would they be short of confidence? They did not look it.\nGoing into the match, Wagner's side had averaged a goal every 123.15 minutes, but here they got two in under half an hour. They were deserved, too. The home side were first to the loose balls and always positive when they got possession.\nThat theme continued after the break and they ought to have steered more comfortably clear of their opponents sooner. Bournemouth - even with six minutes of stoppage time - did not have a shot on target in the second half.\nInce was replaced shortly after his glaring miss but the impressive Mounie had a huge hand in finally securing a two-goal cushion. He looked to have grabbed a second of his own with a delightful first-time finish from another Mooy pass - but it was later changed to an own goal for Cook.\nMooy's injury was the only dark note in a win Wagner will hope is a turning point in the season. After the game, Huddersfield confirmed the Australia international had not suffered ligament damage but \"a deep cut on his knee that required stitches\".\nFollowing Huddersfield's previous victory - 4-1 at Watford on 16 December - Wagner said he thought his team were halfway to survival, having already claimed six of a target of 12 wins over the season.\nWith just 11 matches now remaining, they must build on this if they are to secure Premier League safety.\nCherries short of desire?\nBournemouth had won 15 points since Christmas Day going into this weekend; only Liverpool had claimed more.\nThat run had lifted the Cherries from 18th to 10th - they rose up the table as Huddersfield fell down. But here, Eddie Howe's side seemed to wilt in the second half.\nDuring the opening 45 minutes, even though it was Huddersfield who controlled possession, Bournemouth had always looked capable of springing a chance quickly on the counter or from a set piece.\nFraser and Stanislas almost combined again after going 2-1 down before defender Cook nearly scored from Charlie Daniels' disguised low corner. It found the centre-back totally free, six yards from goal - but he struck the ball just wide. It was a golden chance to level the match.\nIn the first half there was promising link-up play - especially between Stanislas, Callum Wilson and Jordon Ibe - even if it most often came to nothing.\nAfter the break they looked flat going forward, and that didn't change even after Joshua King and Lys Mousset were brought on.\nThere was nothing of the urgency that drove Huddersfield. Nothing of the desire to drive themselves up the table. Their 10th position might feel a lot more comfortable, but only five points separates them from 18th.\n\"I apologise to the fans for the performance,\" Howe said. \"There's not much else I can say.\n\"When you're aware of the financial and time sacrifices that people make, you want to reward them with an inspiring performance, one that they can go away and talk about for many years. I don't think that will be happening after that.\"\nMan of the match - Steve Mounie\nSeven-up for Terriers - the stats\nHuddersfield scored more goals against Bournemouth (four) than they managed in their previous eight Premier League games combined (three).\nBournemouth are the seventh team Huddersfield have beaten in all four tiers of English league football, along with Bradford, Brentford, Bury, Grimsby, Portsmouth and Watford.\nPritchard scored his first Premier League goal in his seventh appearance in the competition spanning three clubs (Tottenham, West Brom, Huddersfield).\nRyan Fraser has been involved in five goals in his past six Premier League games (three goals, two assists), as many as in previous 30 matches.\nMooy has registered four top-flight assists this season; more than any other Huddersfield player, with three of them coming for Mounie.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield host Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth round next Saturday before travelling to West Brom in the Premier League on 24 February.\nBournemouth do not play again until 24 February when they host Newcastle in the Premier League."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-0 Manchester United\nNewcastle won a Premier League home game for the first time since October with a surprise victory over second-placed Manchester United.\nMatt Ritchie scored the only goal in the second half as the Magpies climbed out of the relegation zone and left the visitors 16 points adrift of leaders Manchester City.\nThe Red Devils missed a string of chances to take something from a ground at which manager Jose Mourinho is yet to win a league match.\nBut debutant Martin Dubravka was excellent in the Newcastle goal, denying Jesse Lingard, Anthony Martial, Ashley Young and Michael Carrick.\nAnd the hosts could have had a first-half penalty when Chris Smalling tripped Dwight Gayle.\nDefeat for Manchester United raises the prospect of Manchester City being crowned champions when the teams meet at Etihad Stadium on 7 April.\nShould both teams win all of their league matches prior to that, City would only need to draw with their fierce rivals to secure the title that day.\nReaction: We could've been here for 10 hours and not scored - Mourinho\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nNewcastle go the distance for deserved win\nMourinho said after the game that Newcastle had fought \"like animals\" - and the hosts certainly produced a fierce and committed performance.\nThe Magpies made more sprints (553 to their opponents' 490), ran further (115km to 105km), and in DeAndre Yedlin and Ritchie had the game's fastest and most industrious players.\nManager Rafael Benitez may be hoping recent signing Islam Slimani, who missed this game, can add more to an attack that only managed three shots on target, but Ritchie was clinical when it mattered.\nSmalling was penalised for a dive that allowed the impressive Jonjo Shelvey to send in a free-kick. The equally eye-catching Florian Lejeune headed it down, and Ritchie collected Gayle's flick to shoot past David de Gea.\nThat ended a run of 43 shots without a Premier League goal for Ritchie - and gave Newcastle their first home win in the league since 21 October.\nPrior to the match they were just one point better off than in their 2015-16 relegation season, but this win moved them up to 13th - and only three points behind 10th-placed Bournemouth.\nSame team, similar problems to Wembley\nMourinho's decision to select the same starting XI that lost convincingly to top-four rivals Tottenham last month may have unsettled some visiting fans.\nBut, while the Red Devils were much better here than during an abject display at Wembley, some familiar flaws resurfaced.\nThen, Phil Jones missed a crucial first header in the build-up to Christian Eriksen's early goal. Here, nobody tracked Lejeune as he ran between Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba to head down for Ritchie to score.\nSmalling won just 53% of his headed duels, compared to 77% and 75% respectively for Newcastle's central-defensive pairing of Lejeune and Jamaal Lascelles.\nIt suggests a defensive diffidence at odds with a manager who traditionally builds title-winning teams from the back.\nOverall, the visitors had the better chances but were thwarted by Dubravka, who notably stuck out a leg to deny Martial as he latched onto a wonderful, defence-splitting pass from Nemanja Matic in the first half.\nHad that chance - or a header from the French forward - gone in, there may well have been a different outcome.\nInstead, with Spurs and Liverpool increasing the pressure on them, Mourinho's side must assert more aerial dominance and show better focus at the back.\nMan of the match - Martin Dubravka (Newcastle)\nGeordie jinx goes on for Jose - the stats\nMourinho has never won a Premier League match at St James' Park (P7 W0 D3 L4) and has managed more away league games at Newcastle without winning than at any other club in his career.\nMourinho has lost six times against Benitez in all competitions. Only against Pep Guardiola (nine) has he suffered more defeats as a manager.\nNewcastle enjoyed their first win in nine Premier League home games (D3 L5), since beating Crystal Palace in October.\nManchester United have lost five games in the Premier League this season, equalling their tally for the whole of last season.\nRitchie ended a run of 43 shots this season without scoring in the Premier League, which was the longest such run in the division.\nGayle has had a hand in a goal in both of Newcastle's Premier League matches against Manchester United this season, scoring at Old Trafford in November before assisting Ritchie here.\nThe Red Devils have won only one of the nine Premier League matches this season after conceding the opening goal of the game (D3 L5) - a 4-1 win over Newcastle in November.\nManchester United have had three players booked for dives in the Premier League this season (Valencia, Herrera, Smalling), a joint high along with Bournemouth.\n'We could have been here 10 hours and not scored' - what they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho on Match of the Day: \"My verdict is we could've been here for 10 hours and not scored a goal. Newcastle played with their lives and defended with their lives.\n\"They got from us a defensive mistake and from a lateral free-kick they scored. The gods of football were clearly in their side. They must have an amazing feeling after giving absolutely everything\n\"We had some [chances] with the score at 0-0. Alexis [Sanchez] had an open goal and then the countless opportunities of the last 20-25 minutes. The double [miss] of Martial is incredible in the last minute.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez said: \"We worked as hard as other games, but against a team like Manchester United every ball is important, they can punish you, so you work like them. Amazing effort.\n\"They are dangerous, but the teamwork we showed to fight for every ball was amazing. I am pleased for the players and the fans. Because we won here at home.\n\"We had games in past when conceded late. We got lucky with some shots, but we showed the character, the commitment and the desire today.\"\nOn Martin Dubravka's debut: \"He can buy the lottery and win today. He was composed and that gave confidence to the team. All the players worked hard, so it is not fair to say just the goalkeeper played well.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to Huddersfield in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday, 17 February (17:30 GMT), while Newcastle head to Bournemouth in the league on Saturday, 24 February (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-2 Liverpool\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino claimed the \"biggest defeat\" his side suffered in their loss to Liverpool was \"the character we showed in the second half\".\nLiverpool moved to within two points of second-placed Manchester United after goals from Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah secured a comfortable victory.\nBrazil forward Firmino gave Liverpool an early lead with his 20th goal of the season when he finished off a counter attack after being teed up by Salah.\nSouthampton then twice brought saves out of Reds goalkeeper Loris Karius, before Liverpool added a second through Salah after he exchanged passes with Firmino.\nIt was the Egypt international's 29th goal of the season for the club from 36 appearances.\nLiverpool looked the more likely to score again after half-time as Southampton rarely threatened.\n\"The second half was really bad. The people see our reaction on the pitch and the players feel the reaction,\" Pellegrino said.\n\"The anxiety in my players was really high. We understand the emotions of the fans but we have to keep going.\"\nThe win ensured Liverpool took advantage of Manchester United's 1-0 defeat by Newcastle earlier on Sunday and leapfrogged Tottenham back into third place.\nSouthampton drop into the relegation zone, a point behind Huddersfield who beat Bournemouth 4-1, with further scrutiny of Pellegrino's position likely.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nVan Dijk keeps his cool\nLiverpool defender Virgil van Dijk was expected to get a hostile reaction from the Southampton fans on his first return to St Mary's since his move to Anfield, and there were plenty of boos for the Dutchman.\nIndeed, Reds manager Jurgen Klopp revealed in the build-up to the match he would speak to Van Dijk\n, external\nabout the need to maintain his composure in light of the ill-feeling towards him.\nThe 26-year-old, whose protracted move to the Reds for \u00a375m from Southampton was eventually completed in January after the transfer saga of last summer, more than kept his cool at the heart of Liverpool's defence.\nHis performance was one with which the Southampton fans would have been familiar - towering headers, key interceptions and brave blocks while marshalling the backline.\nIt was this kind of faultless defensive display Liverpool fans had yearned for before his arrival, and the kind Southampton now so desperately miss.\nSouthampton need more from Carrillo\nSouthampton's victory over West Brom in their previous match ended a run of 12 league matches without a win, but this defeat will have damaged their confidence.\nA sluggish start and defensive mistakes - with Wesley Hoedt the most culpable - allowed Liverpool to take the lead with a quicksilver counter-attack finished off by Firmino.\nThere was little the hosts could do about Liverpool's second as Firmino's brilliant backheel set up Salah.\nBut the worry for Saints fans will be how toothless they were in attack at home, and particularly the lack of threat posed by Guido Carrillo.\nPellegrino made striker Carrillo their club record \u00a319m signing from Monaco in January, but the Argentine has yet to find the net.\nSouthampton need Carrillo to show more from here until the end of the season if they are to avoid the drop.\nKarius builds case to start in Porto\nLiverpool manager Klopp has rotated goalkeepers Karius and Simon Mignolet according to competition this season.\nWhichever man has not been first choice in the Premier League has instead started in the Champions League.\nKlopp stated last month that Karius would be his first choice for league matches, but under his policy to date Mignolet would return in goal for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie away to Porto.\nHowever, the impressive display by Karius at St Mary's will surely prompt Klopp to rethink his approach, particularly as the European competition represents Liverpool's last hope of a trophy this season.\nWith Liverpool 1-0 up against the Saints the German made two fine saves - narrowing the angle to block a Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg shot and tipping a James Ward-Prowse header over the crossbar - while his quick distribution played a part in Firmino's opening goal.\nWill Klopp now risk bringing back Mignolet for such an pivotal game on Wednesday? If he does bank on Karius in Portugal, it could well signal the end of Mignolet's Anfield career given the Belgian's desire to play regularly.\n'We don't have normal weekends anymore'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It was not a brilliant performance, not everything worked quite well, the wind was quite strange. It was difficult circumstances and we did the job. That is very important.\n\"We scored early, got the second goal in the right moment and then controlled the game.\n\"We don't have normal weekends anymore. We want to finish the season top four and we need the points. I don't think nine points from Arsenal is enough to have rest but it is nine points. There is a lot to go for and we will try to carry on like today.\"\nLiverpool winger Mohamed Salah: \"I said in beginning, I always try to help the team. When you score of course you help the team.\n\"So I'm not surprised, but we need to forget about the past and keep looking forward. We have more league games and the Champions League.\"\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino (Liverpool)\nSalah puts left foot first - the best stats\nJurgen Klopp has won 50 of his 95 Premier League games in charge (D28 L17) - the ninth fastest manager to reach 50 wins.\nSouthampton have won just once in their past 14 Premier League games (D7 L6), and kept only one clean sheet in the process.\nLiverpool have already scored more Premier League away goals in this campaign (34) than they managed in the entirety of 2016-17 (33).\nMohamed Salah has been directly involved in 29 Premier League goals this season (22 goals, 7 assists), the most by a Liverpool player in their debut season.\nSalah has scored 19 left-footed goals in the Premier League this term - the joint-most by a player in a single season, alongside Robbie Fowler for Liverpool in 1994-95.\nOnly twice in the past 16 seasons have Liverpool seen two players score 20 times in a campaign in all competitions.

I don't want this pressure to weigh on the shoulders of my players.\"\nConte needed the brilliance of Eden Hazard to settle early uncertainty on the pitch and in the stands.\nHazard exchanged passes with Olivier Giroud before giving Chelsea a first-half lead and, after Victor Moses slid home a second after the break, sealed victory with a powerful drive in the 71st minute.\nThe win took the Blues a point ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham.\nWest Brom, meanwhile, are seven points from safety after one win in 25 league games.\nThey were hampered by losing loan signing Daniel Sturridge to injury inside three minutes. Substitute Jay Rodriguez wasted an opportunity to put them ahead when clean through, and Salomon Rondon and Jonny Evans also missed chances with the game in the balance.\n\"Losing Daniel Sturridge after three minutes was a blow in itself,\" said Pardew. \"That was probably a bigger blow than the result.\n\"He felt his hamstring after a 60m sprint in the first moments of the game. We'll have to nurse him.\"\nFor Conte, however, it was a satisfying night and the pressure - temporarily at least - is off.\nReaction from Stamford Bridge\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nConte feels Stamford Bridge's love\nConte walked out to take his place in the technical area with his future as Chelsea manager shrouded in uncertainty.\nThe Italian insists he wants to see out the remainder of his contract - which runs until 2019 - and the club have not shown any inclination they want to bring his reign to an end just months after he won the Premier League in his first season.\nYet there is the assumption the clock is running down to the end of the season and the conclusion of Conte's Chelsea career - perhaps even sooner had another poor result followed the heavy losses to Bournemouth and Watford.\nThis was a fixture with the capacity to be troublesome, but Conte got what he wanted - and so did Chelsea's fans.\nIf supporter reaction can be used as an accurate measure, Conte retains huge backing among the fanbase.\nHis name echoed around Stamford Bridge inside the first minute, acknowledged politely by the Italian, and the noisy backing was repeated at regular intervals throughout a routine victory.\nThere was certainly no shortage of touchline commitment from Conte, urging his players with actions and words throughout, boiling over at a tackle from behind on Giroud from Evans and even finding time to give substitute Alvaro Morata some very boisterous advice.\nBut he will know he needs to keep winning, with an FA Cup fifth-round tie at home to Hull City, a Champions League last-16 meeting with Barcelona, and a visit to top-four rivals Manchester United to come.\nAnd Chelsea fans will know owner Roman Abramovich does not make managerial decisions based on the popular vote, rather with a ruthless, hard-headed approach that has ensured continued success.\nFor now, though, the mood has lifted.\nHazard lifts Chelsea gloom\nConte needed his big players to turn up to release the pressure that has been building around him. He has no bigger player than Hazard - and how the Belgian delivered.\nChelsea started nervously but it was Hazard who broke the deadlock after 25 minutes to make life a lot easier for both his manager and the home fans.\nIt was the result of a slick exchange with Giroud, who held his position with strength and awareness to play Hazard's pass perfectly back into his path for an emphatic finish.\nHazard was central to everything Chelsea did, and it was another moment of magic 19 minutes from time that ended any slim hope Albion had of mounting an unlikely recovery.\nBaggies keeper Foster left a large gap towards his left-hand post but Hazard showed peerless technique and power to find it with unerring accuracy for Chelsea's third.\nOn a satisfying night, Conte can also be pleased with the performance of Giroud, who not only assisted Hazard's first goal but acted as a focal point for the Chelsea attack and showed signs of early promise in his link-up with the Belgian.\nSturridge sums up West Brom's plight\nSturridge was West Brom's high-profile January signing, designed to provide the goals and quality they need to stay up following his arrival on loan from Liverpool.\nAnd yet, in a scene played out with miserable regularity throughout his career, the England international was gone within minutes, and into what could be a lengthy injury lay-off.\nSturridge was involved in his first action inside three minutes, a regulation chase and tussle for possession with Cesar Azpilicueta. The result was an ominous grimace and stumble before making his way forlornly down the tunnel.\nIt is the latest disappointing chapter in the tale of injuries that have hounded Sturridge in recent years, his golden season alongside Luis Suarez at Liverpool just a distant memory.\nWest Brom did not lack spirit, but when the big opportunities came they failed to take them, with Rodriguez and Rondon the major culprits when given clear sights of goal, and Evans heading a perfect chance wide from a corner.\nManager Alan Pardew might take some encouragement from what might have been - but he needs more than that to rescue what is becoming an increasingly desperate position.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"It was important to get three points, especially after two defeats. The two bad defeats brought our confidence down and it was important to win and score three goals and keep a clean sheet.\n\"To lose two games in a row in the league you feel confidence is going down. At the same time we have to try and avoid these situations and play our football.\n\"We have to try and face this situation and be men and overcome this situation.\"\nWest Bromwich Albion head coach Alan Pardew: \"If we can get two or three wins in our next group of games we can put pressure on the other teams.\n\"When you go to a top six team who are wounded a little bit, we had a great chance to hurt them. We missed a great chance and five minutes later we were 1-0 down.\n\"We just couldn't hurt them. Once they got the second goal you could see the relief in the team and the crowd.\"\n'Can we play you every week' - the stats\nChelsea have won all four Premier League meetings against West Brom under Antonio Conte without conceding a goal.\nWest Brom have not beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in any of their past 17 visits in all competitions, since winning 1-0 in the League Cup in November 1983.\nHazard has had a hand in 105 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea (68 goals, 37 assists) - only Didier Drogba (159) and Frank Lampard (237) have been involved in more for the club.\nHazard has scored 10-plus goals in four of his past five Premier League seasons.\nGiroud became the first player in Premier League history to start a game for both Chelsea and Arsenal in the same season.\nMoses has scored two goals in his past three Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 47 combined.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea face Hull City in the FA Cup fifth round on Friday (20:00 GMT) and Barcelona in the Champions League on 20 February before their next Premier League game - at Manchester United on 25 February.\nWest Brom are also in FA Cup action at the weekend, with Southampton visiting The Hawthorns on Saturday (15:00)."

However, the ball flew past the Foxes striker, and his marker Moritz Bauer, and bounced off the chest of Butland into the net.\n\"He will make mistakes and sometimes these things make you strong,\" said Lambert. \"I have no fear about Butland because he is a top goalkeeper.\"\nThe 24-year-old made two brilliant saves as he went some way to atoning for his mistake. The first was an exquisite one-handed stop from Riyad Mahrez, and that was followed by a superb fingertip effort to push Harry Maguire's shot onto the post.\nHowever, Butland would have had no chance of keeping out Matty James' stoppage-time header, which fortunately for his side came back off a post.\nThe point for the Potters leaves them in the bottom three with the rest of their relegation rivals yet to play. The Foxes move one place above Burnley into seventh.\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nButland's nightmare moment\nStoke boss Lambert will have to hope his number one can put his Leicester nightmare behind him as the Potters prepare for what is expected to be a tense run-in.\nButland, with two clean sheets during the Scot's tenure so far, had barely got his gloves dirty before his mistake - but then came the most memorable moment of the match which the keeper must want to blank out of his mind.\nThe bright sunshine might have hindered the keeper's vision, but it looked as though Butland simply failed to read the delivery from Albrighton.\nIt is tight down at the bottom and had Shaqiri's brilliant shot from the edge of the area after Joe Allen had retrieved the ball on the left been the only goal, then Stoke would have moved out of the relegation zone - at least temporarily.\nHowever, Butland's error meant Lambert's side have only a point from the game - and it is fellow strugglers Southampton next for them.\nShaqiri's strike wakes up Foxes\nClaude Puel's Leicester find themselves in the mid-table comfort zone, which goes some way to explaining why they only have two wins from the past 11 and their lack of intensity in the first half.\nThe Foxes controlled the possession in opening period but never placed Butland under much pressure. What they needed was a jolt and that was provided by Shaqiri's strike.\nAfter the break, it was a different side that took to the pitch and one that perhaps should have claimed all three points.\nThe equaliser was fortuitous, but what followed were two great efforts from Mahrez and Maguire, and then James' header in the closing seconds.\nThey have 36 points, with two more wins expected to guarantee safety.\nMan of the match - Marc Albrighton (Leicester City)\n'We lacked a clinical edge' - reaction\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"Not enough to win today. We could have, but we could also have lost - so perhaps a draw is fair. Their goalkeeper made some good saves, but we also conceded chances.\n\"I thought we started well, with intensity, but it became too slow to find space. It was better second half, but without a clinical edge or a little luck to find a winning goal.\"\nAllen comes up with the goods again - the stats\nStoke have won just one of their past nine top-flight games (four defeats), scoring just six goals in that period.\nSince the start of last season, the Potters have scored seven own goals in the Premier League, more than any other side.\nShaqiri has scored in three consecutive games in Europe's big five leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) for the first time.\nNine of Shaqiri's 14 Premier League goals have come from outside the box (64%).\nAllen has provided five Premier League assists this season (26 apps), as many as in his previous six seasons combined in the competition (163 apps).\nTyrese Campbell made his Premier League debut 4326 days after his father Kevin Campbell last made an appearance in the division (April 2006 v Newcastle).\nWhat's next?\nStoke are at Southampton in another potentially crucial league fixture at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, 3 March. Leicester host Bournemouth at the same time."

They were both self-inflicted really, and it is incredibly difficult to lift yourself up from there.\n\"It's another point that nudges us towards where we want to be - every one could be vital at the end of the season.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"It is always difficult when you have a team that is pushing at home but we had the chances to finish the game and didn't do it, we have to improve on that.\n\"We were I think in control of the game and had a clear idea of how to do things. They didn't have too many chances, I would say that the chance that we missed [Shelvey's] and then the goal they scored quickly after, that changed everything. After that, we lost control. We have lost two points.\"\nStats - Cherries are the comeback kings\nBournemouth have picked up 13 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, a joint-high along with Everton.\nNewcastle failed to win a Premier League game after being two goals up at half-time for the first time since February 2012 (a 2-2 draw against Wolves).\nBournemouth have gone eight Premier League home games without a clean sheet, their longest such run at Vitality Stadium.\nNewcastle bagged two first-half goals away from home for the first time in the Premier League since March 2014 against Hull.\nMohamed Diame made his 200th Premier League appearance, becoming only the second Senegalese player to hit this milestone after El-Hadji Diouf (243).\nDwight Gayle ended a run of 11 Premier League appearances without a goal.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth travel to Leicester on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Newcastle are at Liverpool (17:30 GMT)."

That depends on the other results,\" added Klopp.\n\"We have to focus on ourselves. The next game is Newcastle and Rafa Benitez is one of the best managers in the world.\"\nLiverpool's clinical finishing and counter-attacks again proved the difference, though not until Firmino made it 3-0 were the hosts able to really relax.\nWhen they did, they conceded, but even Antonio's goal could not take the shine off this win.\nLiverpool are now unbeaten in 16 matches at home in the league - hitting excellent form at the right time of the season.\n\"We defended well and attacked well,\" said Klopp. \"Our counter-attacking was outstanding, the work-rate was outstanding and the attitude was fantastic.\"\nMoyes' Anfield frustration continues\nWith the game goalless, Marko Arnautovic produced an outrageous lob which was tipped onto the bar by Loris Karius, and the Liverpool keeper was later tested from outside the area by the Austrian.\nYet positives were few and far between for Hammers boss Moyes, who gave a debut to former Manchester United full-back Patrice Evra.\nHis side are down to 13th in the table, their safety cushion cut from four points to three with 10 matches remaining.\nFifteen years on from his first visit to the venue as a manager, Moyes has yet to win at Anfield. This was his 15th game at Liverpool's home - and his eighth defeat.\nYet the Scot was keen to focus on the positives after seeing his team ripped apart by Liverpool's front three.\n\"We knew how hard it was going to be but I thought we played well in the first half,\" said Moyes. \"We were never going to get loads of chances here, we knew that.\"\nTime will tell whether this heavy defeat was a blip or something more troubling.\nWest Ham came within seven minutes of a draw at Manchester City on 3 December, while they have beaten Chelsea and drawn with Tottenham and Arsenal since Moyes took charge in November.\nBut this was a day to forget.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nFour, four, four - the stats\nLiverpool have scored four or more goals in three consecutive league games against a single opponent for the first time since doing so against Norwich between 2012-2013.\nMoyes has failed to win at Anfield as manager of Everton, Manchester United, Sunderland and now West Ham.\nSalah has been directly involved in 31 Premier League goals this season (23 goals, eight assists), more than any other player.\nHe has scored 20 goals with his left foot in the Premier League this season, the most by a player in a single season in the competition's history.\nLiverpool (103) are the second Premier League team to score 100-plus goals in all competitions this season after Manchester City (111).\nEvra made his Premier League debut for West Ham, the 36-year-old Frenchman is the fifth-oldest outfield player to make an appearance this season.\nAntonio has scored in four of his five appearances against Liverpool for West Ham.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool await former boss Rafael Benitez's return to Anfield with Newcastle United next Saturday (17:30 GMT).

No Burnley player has scored more this term (level with Wood).\nThe Clarets have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their past five home Premier League games, this after keeping four shutouts in the previous five.\n'Blame won't change result' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"You can only control what you can control. The performance was good, certainly enough to win three points. It is another point on the table. We're still finding ourselves. We've had a tough run. We did enough to win. The game was petering out to nothing.\n\"They huffed and puffed, but didn't create too much.\n\"We should have had a penalty for a foul on Barnes, and he reacted well to get his goal. There was a handball outside the box by their keeper, then the goal of course. Apart from all those things, I'm pleased with everything.\"\nOn Southampton's controversial equaliser: \"It's irrelevant who I blame, because it is not going to change anything.\n\"We know what this division is about, if you lay your hand on anyone in the top half they go down.\"\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino: \"At the end, the game was difficult, because Burnley don't concede too many. The goal gave us a good feeling, because there wasn't too many chances. We competed at the start of second half but maybe they were stronger than us in some respects.\n\"It's one point, but the draw is almost the same as a win.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Everton on Saturday, 3 March (12:30 GMT), while Southampton welcome Stoke on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

The game opened up in the second half. They decided to change, which made it a more open game. One side usually benefits when that happens and we benefited more.\n\"That has to be on the back of a good defensive display and we were well worthy of the win.\n\"At the moment, though, we look as though we can score a goal.\"\nSwansea manager Carlos Carvalhal:\n\"The story is we tried to turn it around by putting more players into attack in the second half because we were losing and we wanted to win three points.\n\"We reacted well to their first goal. We took a player from midfield and put them up front, we knew that was a big risk. We'd either win the game or the opponent would score.\n\"We took those risks very early.

It was a high-risk bet.\"\nDunk's unwanted own goal record - the stats\nBrighton scored four goals in a game for the first time ever in the Premier League and the first time in the league since February 2017 (4-1 v Burton Albion).\nOnly three Englishmen have scored more Premier League goals this season than Glenn Murray (10) - Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Jamie Vardy.\nJose Izquierdo has been directly involved in a goal in each of his last three Premier League games (two goals, one assist), after managing just two goals and two assists in his previous 20 this season.\nLewis Dunk has scored four own goals in the Premier League this season - the joint-most by a player in a single season in the competition's history (with Martin Skrtel in 2013-14).\nSwansea suffered their first defeat in their last six top-flight games (won three, drawn two), conceding one goal more against Brighton than in their previous five games combined.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea City return to the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday, 27 February with their FA Cup fifth round replay against Carlos Carvalhal's former club Sheffield Wednesday (20:05 GMT).\nThe Swans are also at home as they resume their Premier League campaign against West Ham on Saturday, 3 March (15:00 GMT); while on Sunday, 4 March, Brighton welcome Arsenal to the Amex (13:30 GMT)."

It is a problem, we just have to find a way to win a game, however ugly it is. It was certainly ugly today.\n\"I was disappointed with the performance. We worked hard this week and looked good going into the game but it wasn't reflected in the game.\n\"Huddersfield knock you out of any rhythm with the way they play and it was a bitty game. We didn't really have any passages of play. We have two or three flair players missing but we should have had enough to beat Huddersfield really.\"\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"We said this before, it wasn't a six-pointer but it was a massive game for us and the players showed everything - fighting spirit and attitude.\n\"It was a final for both teams, we won it and of course I am delighted and happy for the supporters, the players and staff.\n\"We expected they would be on the front foot. We overcame the first 10 minutes without us conceding a goal. After that it was open, we scored two wonderful goals and kept them as far as possible from our goal.\"\nTerriers do the double - the stats you may have missed\nHuddersfield Town have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since their opening two fixtures of the season.\nWest Bromwich Albion are the first side the Terriers have done a Premier League double over since reaching the competition.\nUnder Alan Pardew, West Brom have accrued just eight points in 14 Premier League matches (W1 D5 L8), four fewer than their first 14 games of the campaign before his arrival (W2 D6 L6).\nRajiv van La Parra has scored two of his three Premier League goals against the Baggies.\nSteve Mounie, who has been directly involved in four goals in his last four appearances in all competitions (three goals, one assist), has now scored six Premier League goals for Huddersfield, making him their outright top scorer in the competition ahead of Laurent Depoitre (five goals).\nFive of the West Brom's last six Premier League goals have been scored via corners, with Chris Brunt assisting four of those.\nIn fact, since his Premier League debut in August 2008, Chris Brunt has provided 32 assists from set plays, more than any other player.\nSince the 2014-15 campaign, Craig Dawson has scored 12 Premier League goals; no other defender has more in that time.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom face Watford at Vicarage Road on Saturday, 3 March at 15:00 GMT while Huddersfield take on Tottenham at Wembley Stadium at the same time."

I've got 35 now, so I just have to keep scoring goals.\"\nBefore Kane's match-winning moment, Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey saved superbly from Ben Davies with just over 15 minutes left, and Serge Aurier missed an open goal for the visitors inside the last five minutes.\nHelped by Chelsea's 2-1 defeat at Manchester United, Spurs moved up one place to fourth and extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 15 games.\nMauricio Pochettino's side are the only team yet to lose a Premier League match in 2018, although this was only a third league win in their past 10 away games.\nDefeat leaves Palace 17th, level on points with 18th-placed Swansea.\nDive, dive, dive\nDele Alli was involved in another diving controversy with 16 minutes remaining.\n\"He's probably half a foot away from Wayne Hennessy when he's dived into him,\" former Premier League striker Steve Claridge said on BBC Radio 5 live, in reference to the England midfielder's dramatic tumble over the Palace keeper.\nAlli was not shown a yellow card by referee Kevin Friend on this occasion - he has already been booked twice for diving this season - but he might prefer to avoid social media for a while after his latest fall.\nThe 21-year-old was involved in the most tackles of any Spurs player (five), but it was a quiet match for him overall as he made 36 passes compared with 92 from Eric Dier, and 58 touches compared with 109 by Eriksen.\nIt was a better afternoon for Kane, who has now scored 23 goals in 34 Premier League London derbies - equalling ex-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's total in those fixtures in 30 fewer matches.\nKane's goals have also been worth more points to his club - 14 - than any other player in the top flight this season.\n\"He's incredible and his achievements in this season, and the previous seasons too, have been great,\" said Spurs boss Pochettino.\n\"Congratulations to him for one more goal.\"\nGet well soon, Wilfried\nPalace have 12 senior players out injured heading into the home stretch, including meetings with another three of the top five in their next four games until the end of March.\nThat injury list led manager Roy Hodgson to hand winger Aaron Wan-Bissaka a debut at right-back - and the 20-year-old did not look that out of place.\nBut for Palace, the most crucial on a list that also includes Mamadou Sakho, Martin Kelly, Joel Ward, Jeffrey Schlupp, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Bakary Sako, is Wilfried Zaha.\n\"There wasn't much choice [playing Wan-Bissaka],\" said Hodgson. \"If he hadn't played, I don't know who would have played there.\n\"Playing against a team with Tottenham's quality, we did pretty well I think - but it's so tough when you're robbing the under-23s of players just so you can fill a bench.\"\nPalace have now lost all 10 games they have played without Zaha since September 2016.\nThe Ivory Coast forward, who has scored four league goals in 20 starts this season, injured a knee in the 1-1 draw with Newcastle at the start of February.\nHodgson has said Zaha - who was initially ruled out for a month - is \"well ahead\" of schedule, although that is still likely to be several weeks.\nPalace's fate will probably not be determined by results against Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, but by games like the 17 March visit to Huddersfield that breaks up that run.\n'We always knew we could score' - reaction\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"I think in the end we got what we wanted, and we fully deserved the victory. The three points put us in a really good position in the table.\n\"We started to feel towards the end it was difficult today, but we always knew we could score. We had great players on the pitch and when you have them it's always possible to score.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's very frustrating. I feel really sorry for the players, because to work as hard as that, and to be under the cosh as long as we were, I thought we worked so hard, and suffered the loss of James Tomkins to a severe cramp, so it's cruel then when you concede so late in the game.\n\"If I'd have been talking to you here at 0-0, I'd have been a happy man. But now I can't hide my feelings. I'm not an actor, I'm really sad for the players. I see how disappointed they are in the dressing room and there's not much I can say to change how they feel - no praise will change how they're feeling right now.\"\nAssist king Eriksen at it again- the stats\nOnly Darren Anderton (67) has provided more assists for Spurs in the Premier League than Eriksen (45), who is now joint second alongside Aaron Lennon.\nSpurs are now unbeaten in their past 15 games in all competitions, their longest run since going 16 without defeat between December 1998 and March 1999.\nKane scored the 150th goal of his club career in all competitions, with 134 of those coming as a Spurs player.\nPalace are winless in their past five Premier League games, their worst run since Hodgson took charge in September 2017.\nSpurs have conceded just one goal in their past six games against the Eagles in the Premier League, winning all six meetings.\nIn fact, Spurs have won three consecutive away league games against Palace for the first time in their history.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace's tricky run continues with the visit of Manchester United at home next Monday, 5 March (20:00 GMT), while Tottenham entertain Rochdale in their FA Cup fifth round replay on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before returning to the Premier League against Huddersfield at home next Saturday, 3 March (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-1 Chelsea\nManchester United moved back into second place in the Premier League as substitute Jesse Lingard gave them victory over top-four rivals Chelsea at Old Trafford.\nThe Red Devils had to come from behind after Willian started and finished a flowing move to give the visitors the lead in the first half.\nUnited pulled level before the break, with striker Romelu Lukaku getting in front of Marcos Alonso to score against his former club for the first time.\nLukaku then set up Lingard to head home with 15 minutes left, after which Chelsea's Alvaro Morata had a goal incorrectly disallowed for offside.\nDefeat leaves the Blues in fifth place after Tottenham beat Crystal Palace 1-0 earlier on Sunday.\nA run of just one win in their past four league matches, coupled with Spurs' 10-game unbeaten streak, means they are out of the Champions League places with 10 games remaining.\nChelsea went close to taking the lead at Old Trafford after just four minutes, when Morata ran on to Alonso's brilliant volleyed cross, but his shot hit the bar.\nLukaku, facing the club he played for between 2011 and 2014, also had a flying volley superbly saved by Thibaut Courtois.\nReaction: Conte says top-four push 'won't be easy'\nRelive Man Utd's victory over Chelsea\nLukaku rises to the occasion\nLukaku came into the game having scored 12 goals in the Premier League so far this season, but with none - and only four shots on target - against the other teams in the top six.\nThe Belgian, signed for \u00a375m from Everton last July, had never scored in either seven previous league appearances against Chelsea, or 10 for the Blues during a spell in which he enjoyed more success while on loan at West Brom and Everton.\nBut the 24-year-old edged in front of Alonso to finish off a neat move involving Alexis Sanchez and Anthony Martial and end his dry spell against the top flight's elite.\nLukaku came close to a second when he met Sanchez's superb ball with a flying left-footed volley, but Courtois denied his international team-mate by tipping the ball over.\nHe swung the match decisively in United's favour, though, when he slipped free on the right of the box and chipped in a cross that Lingard nodded home.\nMissed opportunity for Chelsea\nWhen Willian rounded off a move he started to score his fourth goal in his past three outings, everything looked to be falling into place for Antonio Conte's side. The Blues had not lost after scoring first in the league since a 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace on 1 April in 2017 - 22 games ago.\nBut things unravelled - and while Conte substituted the influential Eden Hazard, Mourinho's decision to bring on Lingard was rewarded.\nConte will be aggrieved by the decision to disallow Morata's late goal, and the Italian will look back at the visit to Old Trafford as an opportunity missed.\nPeace breaks out between bosses\nMuch of the build-up to the match had centred on a verbal spat between the two managers over the preceding weeks.\nMourinho had referenced Conte's four-month ban for failing to report match-fixing, for which the Italian was later cleared of any wrongdoing.\nThe Chelsea boss called his United counterpart \"a little man\" - though both played down the issue in their final news conferences before the match.\nConte said the dispute had \"stopped\", while Mourinho said he would \"not speak about it - not at all\".\nDespite that, there was a frisson of interest about how - or perhaps if - they would greet each other before kick-off.\nMourinho was first out of the tunnel while Conte delayed his entrance slightly, but the pair shook hands before referee Martin Atkinson got the match under way.\nThere was another handshake at full-time, coupled with a conciliatory pat on the back of the head from Mourinho.\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United)\nWhat the managers said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"It is not special because it is Chelsea, it is very special as we beat the champions, who are a fantastic team, who are very difficult to beat and because this is the three points that keep us in second place, which is the place we are fighting for.\n\"It opens a little gap, not much to Chelsea, and it is a very important result for us. It feels special as the players gave everything. It is not possible to win against a team with the quality of Chelsea without the quality we gave.\n\"We did not start well, Chelsea started much better, but we found our position on the pitch and found our concentration and we grew up throughout the game.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"We had a great chance to get a good result against Manchester United, but instead we talk about a defeat.\n\"You must be the best team at the end of the game, not just in the first half. We had a great chance to take three points here. Now we have to start to work this season as the league is very difficult and we need to fight for a place in the Champions League. I hope the players realise this soon.\n\"Luck is important for every team, but this season we have not been so lucky. It is disappointing after this performance to finish with a defeat.\"\nLukaku and Lingard lead way - the stats you may have missed\nLingard has scored 13 goals in all competitions for United this season - only Lukaku (22) has scored more.\nUnited have won two of their past three matches against Chelsea - one more than they managed in their previous 14 combined against the Blues.\nChelsea have lost back-to-back away Premier League matches for the first time since November 2015, when they were managed by Mourinho.\nThe Red Devils have lost just one of their past 35 home league matches against the defending top-flight champions (W20 D14).\nChelsea lost a Premier League match in which they scored first for the first time since last April against Crystal Palace. They had won 22 games consecutively when scoring first before today.\nWillian has scored 12 goals in all competitions this season, equalling his best tally in a season for Chelsea (also 12 in 2016-17).\nEden Hazard has been involved in nine goals in his past eight appearances for Chelsea in all competitions (six goals, three assists).\nChelsea have only lost four of their past 55 Premier League games played on Sunday - all four defeats have been in Manchester (two against United, two against City).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea return to the north west when they take on Manchester City at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, 4 March at 16:00 GMT. United are in action the day after, when they face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park at 20:00."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 0-3 Manchester City\nManchester City are \"close\" to winning the Premier League title after comprehensively beating Arsenal for the second time in five days, says manager Pep Guardiola.\nGoals from Bernardo Silva, David Silva and Leroy Sane at Emirates Stadium extended City's lead at the top of the table to 16 points.\nWith 10 games remaining, they need five victories to secure the title.\n\"It's in our hands, we can't deny it,\" Guardiola said.\n\"These are the last steps to be champions. You keep going until the end.\"\nAfter beating the Gunners 3-0 in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday, City dominated in a toxic atmosphere in a stadium featuring large areas of empty seats.\nBernardo Silva opened the scoring in the 15th minute, beautifully curling in a left-footed strike into the far corner after Sane's mazy run.\nDavid Silva finished off a fine team move in the 28th minute for City's second before Sane did the same five minutes later.\nArsenal had the opportunity to cut the deficit shortly after half-time but Ederson saved Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty.\n\"We played with low confidence, you could see that at the start of the game and we paid for it,\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said.\n\"We lost to a team that is the best in the country at the moment.\"\nCity's victory - in Guardiola's 100th game at the club - extended their lead over second-placed Manchester United, while Arsenal stay sixth, 10 points off the top four.\nIs this the end of Wenger's time at Arsenal?\nI question whether Arsenal players are giving everything for Wenger - Keown\nSensational City reaffirm gulf in class\nCity were clinical on Sunday in securing Guardiola's first trophy at the club, although Wenger suggested the game was closer than the 3-0 scoreline suggested.\nAt the Emirates, particularly in the first half, City were at their free-flowing best and Wenger could have no complaints.\nSane dribbled past four defenders for the opening goal before Bernardo Silva's accurate finish and the hosts looked helpless in attempting to prevent the following two goals.\nFor the second, Sane, Sergio Aguero and David Silva combined brilliantly and the Spaniard calmly fired past Petr Cech.\nThe third then came at the end of a flowing move with Kyle Walker squaring to German Sane from in behind the left side of Arsenal's defence.\n\"Mentally we were strong. We were clinical. We scored three outstanding goals,\" Guardiola said.\n\"It is never easy if you are not focused against teams like Arsenal.\n\"We were [focused] and so far we have made an amazing Premier League season.\"\nGuardiola's side are 30 points clear of Arsenal and, with their 16-point lead over Manchester United restored, could win the title in a little over a month when they face their city rivals on 7 April.\nIf they were to win the title that weekend it would be the earliest the Premier League title has ever been won.\nThings only get worse for Wenger\nWenger was prickly in response to questions about his Arsenal future before the game and the result and performance will have done little to silence those questions.\nThe match was played in front of tens of thousands of empty seats in north London, surely not all as a result of the snowy weather.\nMany of those who did attend booed after City's third goal, at half-time, at full-time and when passes went astray, while there were ironic cheers when Cech claimed a catch at one point in the first half.\nNicolas Otamendi's foul on Henrikh Mkhitaryan gave the Gunners slim hope of a comeback in the 53rd minute but the miss from the spot by record signing Aubameyang ended any chance of a contest.\nArsenal have now lost seven times in 2018 and their only route back into the Champions League looks to be winning the Europa League.\nThey have gone 10 games without a clean sheet in the Premier League, their longest run in the competition since February 2002.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown described it as a \"sad evening\" for Wenger on BBC Radio 5 live, adding that the Gunners were \"outplayed and outfought\".\nThere were chants of \"there's only one Arsene Wenger\" from the stands in the final stages but, to add to the Frenchman's misery, those appeared to come from the visiting fans.\n\"[City] took advantage of our lack of confidence,\" Wenger said. \"We're going through a difficult period, they're going through a period where all goes well for them.\n\"When your confidence is not at the best, the first thing that goes is your fluidity in the movement, the spontaneous side of the game.\n\"You could see that tonight. I don't deny their quality because they have top quality, but we're going through a difficult patch at the moment. That's part of football as well unfortunately.\"\nClassic Pep on landmark night\nGuardiola has now won 69 of his 100 games in charge of City and the first-half performance was one of the best he has overseen, although he denied it afterwards.\nThe football was spectacular but they also showcased their clinical finishing and have scored nine goals from just 13 shots on target against Arsenal this season.\nGuardiola has won one trophy this season, has all but sealed another and will also be eyeing the club's first Champions League title.\nInterestingly the Spaniard's record after 100 games in Manchester is actually worse than his starts in previous jobs with Bayern Munich and Barcelona.\nCity have fewer wins, more defeats, have scored fewer goals and have conceded more than Guardiola's sides in Germany and Spain.\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Manchester City)\nHome woe for Arsenal - the best stats\nArsenal suffered their joint-heaviest home Premier League defeat, having also lost by three-goal margins to Coventry (1993), Middlesbrough (2001) and Chelsea (twice in 2009).\nManchester City have now scored more Premier League goals this season (82) than they scored in the entirety of last season (80).\nThis was Manchester City's biggest away win at Arsenal in any competition since a 4-0 triumph in November 1912.\nDavid Silva is only the third David to score on St David's Day in the Premier League, after David Dunn (Blackburn v Man City in 2003) and David Luiz (Chelsea v Man Utd in 2011).\nThis was the first time Arsenal conceded three goals in the first half of a home league game since March 1989 against Nottingham Forest.\nSergio Aguero has had a hand in 14 goals in his past nine Premier League starts (11 goals, three assists).\nMan City have saved 11 of the past 19 penalties they have faced in all competitions (excluding penalty shootouts), with Ederson saving three of the five he has faced this season, including both in the Premier League (also against Crystal Palace).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City's next match sees them face Chelsea on Sunday (16:00 GMT) at Etihad Stadium. Arsenal travel to play Chris Hughton's Brighton earlier the same day (13:30)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-1 Everton\nBurnley ended a run of 11 Premier League matches without a win by coming from behind to beat Everton at Turf Moor.\nSubstitute Chris Wood took advantage of woeful defending to head in the winner from Johann Berg Gudmundsson's corner on 80 minutes.\nCenk Tosun had put the visitors in front on 20 minutes with his first Everton goal, heading past Burnley keeper Nick Pope from Seamus Coleman's neat flick.\nThe Clarets responded superbly, forcing Jordan Pickford into three excellent saves before Ashley Barnes equalised by converting Matthew Lowton's immaculate through ball from deep.\nA dreadful second half from Everton was compounded by the sending-off of captain Ashley Williams for elbowing Barnes late on.\nVictory takes Burnley five points behind sixth-placed Arsenal and is the first time they have won in the Premier League under Sean Dyche after conceding first.\nFollow five Premier League games on Saturday\nEngland's next number one?\nWith Gareth Southgate in attendance at Turf Moor, Pickford and Pope had the opportunity to advance their claims to be part of England's World Cup squad this summer.\nSouthgate's decision may be no clearer after the game - while Pope was perhaps more solid overall, Pickford provided the spectacular.\nThe Everton keeper made three tremendous saves, the first a dive to his right to keep out Barnes' sharp header from Lowton's cross on 30 minutes.\nAfter the interval, Pickford produced an excellent one-handed stop to his left to thwart Aaron Lennon's curving strike before tipping over Ben Mee's glancing header from the resulting corner.\nYet, while his shot-stopping was prodigious, his decision-making was contentious.\nHe could perhaps have been quicker off his line for Barnes' equaliser, and could not battle through the bodies to claim Gudmundsson's corner for the winner - although his defenders were most at fault for both.\nPope, meanwhile, made three more regulation saves but looked composed, continuing to impress in the absence of the injured Tom Heaton.\nPickford and Pope could well be involved in Southgate's squad for matches against the Netherlands and Italy at the end of March but, with Joe Hart still out of West Ham's starting XI, both may have to do more to be England's next number one.\nOne run ends, another drags on\nBurnley had not won in the league since a 1-0 victory over Stoke on 12 December but had clung onto seventh place thanks to six draws and the erratic form of the sides below them.\nThis win takes Dyche's men to 40 points, already matching their total from last year as they look to finish seventh, which would mean they qualify for the Europa League if one of the top six sides wins the FA Cup.\nDespite Tosun's opener, the hosts were the brighter side in the early stages, with Barnes a constant menace for a shaky Everton defence and Lennon impressing against his former club.\nRight-back Lowton was outstanding, his through ball from near the halfway line weighted perfectly for Barnes to collect and score.\nTosun linked up well with Theo Walcott and Gylfi Sigurdsson in the first half but Everton fell away after the break, extending their poor away form to five straight Premier League defeats on the road.\nSigurdsson had a chance to restore Everton's lead two minutes before Wood scored but sliced wide after a brilliant first touch, yet it was weak defending that again undid Sam Allardyce's side.\nWood easily evaded Williams to leap over Michael Keane for the winner, with the frustrated Toffees captain then clashing with Barnes in the Burnley area late on to be dismissed by referee Chris Kavanagh on another miserable away day for Everton.\n'Unprofessional' Williams caps miserable day\nWilliams caught Barnes with his elbow, and did not protest when he was sent off.\nAfter the match, Allardyce told Sky Sports he had \"no complaints\" with the red card, adding Williams had been \"unprofessional\".\nConsidering Everton's defensive frailty, an enforced change of personnel at the back may be a blessing over the next three matches, with Phil Jagielka close to returning to fitness.\n\"I feel worse than the fans - they won't believe this - but it's my responsibility,\" Allardyce told BBC Sport.\nThe reaction from the travelling Everton fans at the final whistle suggests Allardyce was right about that disbelief.\nMan of the match - Matthew Lowton (Burnley)\n'It's simply not good enough' - reaction\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was a thorough performance and winning one. The were some quality moments in it, especially the pass from Lowton for Barnes' goal - it was as good a pass as you will see.\n\"We have more to do. We wanted to correct the run and we have done that. Hopefully that freedom in the second half is something we can carry on.\"\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce on Match of the Day: \"We lost it by not scoring the second goal when we had clear, clear opportunities.\n\"We gifted them a goal which lifted the spirits around the ground. And I always dislike conceding from a corner, it could be avoided. That's five away defeats on the trot. It's simply not good enough.\n\"I feel worse than the fans - they won't believe this - but it's my responsibility. I go home and say to myself 'how do I put this right?' For me to see the players under perform in the second half is very disappointing for me. It's my problem to sort it out.\"\nBurnley equal record points tally - match stats\nBurnley have equalled their best Premier League points tally in a single season (40 - level with 2016-17), with nine games remaining.\nEverton have now lost 19 competitive games in 2017-18; their most in a single season since 2005-06 (21).\nDyche took charge of his 250th game as Burnley manager (W98 D73 L79) - the first to reach this landmark at the club since Stan Ternent (June 1998 - May 2004).\nEverton have lost their past five Premier League away games and have just one victory in their past 23 on the road (D9 L13).\nTosun is the 10th Turkish player to score in the Premier League and the first to do so since Jem Karacan on 4th May 2013 (for Reading v Fulham), 1764 days ago.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to West Ham on Saturday, 10 March and Everton host Brighton on the same day, with both games kicking off at 15:00 GMT."

I don't think it is anything to do with that.\n\"I am employed to be the manager of this football team and I try to put out a side that I think has got a chance of delivering the win.\n\"All I can hope, and what I think was on the surface today, was a commitment from the players to address the situation. Unfortunately for us we came out the wrong side of it.\"\nMeanwhile, Watford move into the top half of the table into ninth and continue their good progress under Javi Gracia.\nPremier League relegation: Who will go down?\nClouds gather for Pardew\nReports of a dressing room bust-up were the latest negative headlines to come out of the Hawthorns this week.\nBaggies midfielder Chris Brunt had reportedly rowed with Pardew and his team-mates after the defeat by Huddersfield Town, while the Albion head coach was given the dreaded vote of confidence by the owners.\nPardew responded by starting Northern Ireland international Brunt as he made two changes, with Jake Livermore making his first league start since 2 January.\nThe first half was short on chances for either side, with Grzegorz Krychowia's close range volley blocked, while Ben Foster did well to get an outstretched foot to Daryl Janmaat's shot on 38 minutes.\nBoth sides improved after the break and Salomon Rondon had a couple of chances, the best of which saw Orestis Karnezis comfortably save his shot on 51 minutes, while Jonny Evans also hit the outside of the post.\nThe visitors had defended resolutely in a tight game, until Deeney's winner undid all their hard work.\nThe statistics after the defeat are damning:\nWest Brom are now on their worst league run since January 2011, when they last lost five in a row.\nThey have just three wins in 38 league matches dating back to March last year.\nWon just one of their last 27 Premier League games (W1 D11 L15).\nSince Pardew took over they have won eight points - the fewest in the league in that time.\nThey have also scored the fewest goals in that time (10).\nWest Brom have nine games to save themselves, with three of their next four fixtures at home. However, their run-in includes tough games against Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United.\n\"We have got nine games left and there are still a lot of points to play for,\" added Pardew. \"A win can change the dynamic, but when you look at our win and goal ratio you question that.\"\nWatford close in on safety\nIt was another solid display by Watford under Gracia with the Hornets winning all three of their Premier League home games under the Spaniard.\nSince Gracia took over at Vicarage Road, they have won three out of five Premier League games and taken 10 points.\nWith 36 points, they are nine points from the bottom three and are closing in on safety for the third successive season.\nOne negative was Richarlison's reaction to being substituted for Okaka in the 54th minute following a frustrating display.\nMan of the match - Troy Deeney\n'One mistake proved costly' - what they said\nWest Brom manager Alan Pardew: \"It was a really tight game. I feel for the players because we made one mistake in the game and it has been costly.\n\"We could definitely do with a break. The players gave me everything today and I cannot ask for more than that.\n\"It is tough but it isn't about me it about West Brom and it is tough for the fans and the players.\n\"We won't give up the fight, we will keep going until we get something. It is tough to stand in front of players and say you haven't really done much wrong today. Mistakes happen in football.\n\"It is just a shame, I think the fans who travelled today would have seen we did everything. Last week we let ourselves down. Next week we have to show the fans a little more of what we showed today.\"\nWatford boss Javi Gracia: \"I don't waste my time thinking about that [being safe from relegation]. I am only focused on the next match and the next three points. I think this is the best mentality for the team.\n\"I am happy at this moment but only focused on the next match.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford's next fixture is a Premier League trip to Arsenal on 11 March (13:30 GMT). West Brom are in action a day earlier on Saturday, 10 March, as they host Leicester City at The Hawthorns (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-0 Stoke City\nStoke manager Paul Lambert feels his side have the \"momentum\" heading into the final nine games of the season, after drawing with Southampton.\nThe Potters are above only West Brom in the Premier League, and were indebted to goalkeeper Jack Butland at St Mary's.\nBut the draw means they have lost just one of their six games under Lambert, after losing six of the eight before that.\nAnd they are only one point behind Southampton, who are in the first position of safety.\n\"Credit to the team, a few months ago we would have lost it,\" said Lambert, who replaced Mark Hughes in January. \"It was fantastic.\n\"Look at the table and three points takes you to 13th, I think. Momentum is with us. But a big credit to the team for that.\"\nSaints' failure to score meant Stoke kept an away clean sheet in the league for the first time in 10 matches.\nThe hosts slipped to just one place above the relegation zone after Butland denied Josh Sims, Cedric Soares and Nathan Redmond in the second half.\nAnd Stoke were fortunate Saints substitute Sofiane Boufal failed to find the target with a free header with his first touch.\nBrilliant Butland keeps Saints at bay\nThe draw edged the Saints a point clear of 18th place but meant they set a new Premier League club record by going eight consecutive home matches without a win.\nSouthampton found Butland on his best form, particularly in the second half, but Boufal should have given the England goalkeeper no chance.\nHe had only just replaced Sims on 76 minutes when he failed to divert Nathan Redmond's cross on target from just outside the six-yard area.\nSaints had 15 corners compared to just four from Stoke, and failed to convert having 65% of possession into goals.\nThat underlines the fact they are missing Charlie Austin, with the striker still sidelined by a hamstring injury.\nAustin has scored six goals this season - and had five in his previous seven games before getting injured against Huddersfield just before Christmas.\nManager Mauricio Pellegrino has other options, but Manolo Gabbiadini has only just ended a run of 16 games without a goal, and Argentine Guido Carrillo has yet to score since arriving in January.\nOn a positive note for Southampton, Sims did not look out of place on just his second Premier League start.\nThe 20-year-old returned in December after nine months out injured, having made 13 appearances last season under former manager Claude Puel.\nHe looked dangerous, being denied by Butland on several occasions and also linking well with his team-mates.\nStill hope for Stoke\nStoke would be playing Championship football were the season now over, but they kept themselves in the mix for survival with a third draw in as many games.\nStoke were 18th in the Premier League table, a point away from safety, when Lambert took over from Hughes following a run of five defeats in seven Premier League games.\nTheir home match with Manchester City a week on Monday could be regarded as a free hit, then Everton visit the Bet365 Stadium the following Saturday.\nThe latter is clearly a much more winnable fixture - and they may have to rely on their home form to stay up, having won just one away game all season; this draw was just the eighth point they have won on their travels.\nButland ensured their goals against column did not swell beyond 54, and Shaqiri again looked lively before fading in the second half.\nBut Stoke will hope Mame Biram Diouf's shoulder injury, which forced him off in the first half, is not too serious.\nThe Senegalese is believed to have dislocated his shoulder during a strong aerial challenge with Wesley Hoedt inside the first 20 minutes.\n\"It looks like Mame Diouf's shoulder has popped out. I need to see how he is feeling. It was a big loss as he gave us an outlet,\" added Lambert.\nMan of the match - Jack Butland (Stoke City)\n'Every single game is important' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino: \"We dominated the game in the second half and had the most clear chances. It is efficiency. We couldn't score. We couldn't convert the possession into goals. That is part of football. We are disappointed but we need to use the second half for the next game.\n\"The team played with more tempo second half and did enough to try and win the game, but we have to do it from the beginning. Maybe the tempo wasn't good enough at the start. There was a lot pressure. They pressed us and we couldn't find the spaces.\n\"You have to try and find different solutions. This is the Premier League. We know it is tough. Everyone tries to win the game. Every single game is important now.\"\nStoke keep it clean - the key stats\nSouthampton have won just once in the past 16 Premier League games (D9 L6), and are winless in their past eight at St Mary's.\nSaints have failed to score in three consecutive home Premier League meetings with Stoke, their joint-longest run without scoring against a single opponent on home soil in the competition (also against Wimbledon in 1998 and Bolton in 2003).\nThe Potters have failed to find the back of the net in five of their past nine league games, netting just five goals in total in those games.\nSouthampton mustered 18 shots in this game, the most they have attempted without scoring in a Premier League game since the opening day of the season against Swansea (29).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to Newcastle next Saturday 10 March (15:00 GMT), while Stoke have an extra two days to prepare for the visit of Premier League leaders Manchester City (20:00 GMT)."

We just had to see it out.\"\nHowe acknowledged his players had their \"backs to the wall\" for most of the second half, but felt they had \"dug in well\".\nHe added: \"My emotion was a disgusted one to see the goal go in, but you have to admire the technical quality for Riyad Mahrez to score from there.\"\nMahrez had earlier chipped tamely at Asmir Begovic, shortly before King was clipped by Marc Albrighton to win a spot-kick he converted.\nIn a feisty affair, Leicester's second-half dominance eventually told despite despite Bournemouth's best efforts to cling on.\nSteve Cook produced a vital block from Ben Chilwell, and Kelechi Iheanacho squandered a chance to equalise before Mahrez's late intervention.\nThe Foxes remain without a league win since mid-January, but a draw kept them in eighth place. Bournemouth are 11th.\nRelive the late drama in Leicester 1-1 Bournemouth\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nMahrez magic rescues Leicester\nLeicester were just moments away from a third loss in five league matches, after recent defeats by Everton and Manchester City.\nHowever, Mahrez proved why they were so keen to keep hold of him - both in the summer and in January - with a wonderful strike to secure a point.\nThe Algerian grew into the game the further it went, and eventually made up for his missed opportunity in the first half, when Begovic saved his chip.\nMahrez began to link well with Vardy in the latter stages, creating space and winning Leicester a series of corners - they had 11 in the second half.\nHis deliveries caused problems for Bournemouth, and Wes Morgan, Harry Maguire, Chilwell and Iheanacho all had efforts blocked.\nAnd, in the end, he made the most important set-piece count.\nBournemouth resilience almost pays off\nThis was a pleasing performance for Howe's side - and their resilience in defence almost paid off.\nThere were several occasions when players threw themselves in front of the ball to keep them ahead - and their reaction when Dan Gosling blocked Mahrez late on was telling; they knew they were clinging on.\nGosling's block followed similar efforts from Cook and Simon Francis, who were strong throughout as part of a back three.\nThe Cherries could have had a chance to double their lead shortly after the break, when Charlie Daniels appeared to be pulled down in the box by Wilfred N'didi.\nBut referee Lee Probert waved away strong claims for a penalty, and Leicester became dominant.\nYet, despite that, Bournemouth had their chances - with King and Francis shooting off target.\nBut when Cook went through the back of Iheanacho to concede the stoppage-time free-kick, Mahrez ended their spirited resistance with a special finish.\n'A crucial point' - what the managers say\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"We deserved something more because it was crazy with all the chances in the second half. It is just one point but not enough for us at home.\n\"I am happy with the spirit and mentality of the team. They believed and tried until the end and it is an important goal from Riyad Mahrez. It is important to continue our momentum and we will play like we did in the second half in the future.\n\"It was the last opportunity to score in the game and quality players can make the difference from these situations. It is a crucial point for us because we gave our best in this game.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"Winning in this league makes a massive difference, but it is another point. We are edging to safety but looking to make it quicker.\"\nBournemouth retain upper hand - the best of the stats\nLeicester have not won any of their past five Premier League games (D3 L2); their longest run without a win since the final six games of Craig Shakespeare's tenure (D3 L3).\nThe Foxes remain winless against Bournemouth in the Premier League (P6 W0 D5 L1).\nMahrez's goal was his 36th for Leicester in the Premier League, but his first from a direct free-kick.\nBournemouth have scored in 10 consecutive games for the first time in the Premier League, netting in every game they have played since Boxing Day 2017.\nSince their debut Premier League season in 2015-16, only Leicester (12) have won more penalties away from home than Bournemouth (nine).\nDespite having 14 shots (including blocks) in the second half, Mahrez's late equaliser was Leicester's only shot on target after the break.\nThere have been just seven goals in the six Premier League games between Leicester and Bournemouth, with neither side scoring more than once in a game.\nMan of the match - Steve Cook (Bournemouth)\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to The Hawthorns to take on strugglers West Bromwich Albion next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Bournemouth host Tottenham in Sunday's late kick-off (16:00 GMT)."

Win those and they will all but secure their future.\nWhat Huddersfield want to avoid is going into the final four games of the season with their top-flight status in doubt.

        "article_text": "Swansea City 4-1 West Ham United\nSwansea moved out of the relegation zone as they comfortably dispatched a dismal West Ham side whose performance was so \"embarrassing\" manager David Moyes said it was \"impossible to assess\".\nKi Sung-yueng shot low into the corner from Andre Ayew's pass to open the scoring inside 10 minutes, before Mike van der Hoorn nodded in the South Korean's corner amid slack marking.\nBetween those two first-half goals, Winston Reid was put in a neck brace and taken off on a stretcher after suffering a bad injury in a goalmouth scramble.\nHe received treatment for 10 minutes after appearing to be knocked unconscious, and was taken to hospital for a scan.\nAfter the break, West Ham crumbled further. Andy King tapped in the rebound from an Adrian save that denied Andre Ayew's header from another corner, before Cheikhou Kouyate tripped Ayew in the box.\nAndre's brother Jordan Ayew coolly slotted the spot-kick into the corner to round off a vital win that was only slightly dampened by Michail Antonio's late consolation, the substitute winger finishing from Aaron Cresswell's delivery.\n\"The fans travelled through the snow to get here and we let them down badly,\" Moyes added.\n\"We had no intensity in our play, we thought we could just stroll about.\"\nMeanwhile, Carlos Carvalhal's impressive work continues. His team are now up to 13th in the table - climbing above the Hammers on goal difference - having been bottom when he took over in late December. This was a seventh consecutive home win in all competitions.\nWest Ham drop to 14th, with both sides still only three points clear of the bottom three.\nThe anatomy of a goal\nJust after the break, with David Moyes' thoughts on being two goals down at half-time presumably still fresh in their minds, West Ham shipped a third.\nAndre Ayew rose to head from another Ki corner, and Adrian reacted well to keep it out but palmed his stop straight into Javier Hernandez's face. Out the ball came - dropping to the one white shirt in a position to tap home, as the markers around him slumped.\nKing's goal was his first since joining on loan from Leicester, and it summed up West Ham's performance in one action. They were sluggish, unfortunate, beaten.\nIn the first half, Adrian had been slow to get down and reach the Ki shot from range that crept steadily into the corner after nobody closed him. Then came the injury to Reid that left the Hammers with a makeshift defence, four regular full-backs across the line.\nThat might explain something of the poor marking from which Van der Hoorn profited for the second goal that sent Swansea clear and never looking back, but not once did it feel like West Ham were capable of finding a response to adversity.\nWith just nine games remaining before the end of the season - and just two of those coming against teams also in danger of relegation (Stoke and Southampton), this is what will concern Moyes most of all.\nMoving on up - and staying there\nSwansea reached the FA Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 1964 with victory over Sheffield Wednesday in a dire match on Tuesday evening. Afterwards, Carvalhal said staying in the Premier League was still the club's priority.\nPerhaps that's why this game was so much more entertaining. The home side bristled with confidence and adventure as they took full advantage of their opponents' apparent surrender.\nThese were three more points won in a remarkable run under manager Carvalhal - and despite last weekend's bruising 4-1 defeat at Brighton.\nThe Portuguese has transformed his side since taking over from Paul Clement, winning 17 points from nine league games in charge. Clement had won 12 points from the season's first 18.\nOn average, the number of points to guarantee survival in the previous 22 top flight seasons is 36.6. On this evidence, with matches against Huddersfield and Southampton to come next, they will surely easily surpass that total.\nDeadly from the spot - the stats\nSwansea have scored 20 of their 21 Premier League penalties. Of teams to have taken at least five, that is the best success rate in the competition's history (95%).\nKi Sung-Yeung has had a hand in three goals in his past four PL appearances for Swansea (two goals, one assist), having previously gone 14 games without registering a single goal or assist.\nWest Ham have conceded 37 goals away from home in the league so far this season, more than any other side in the competition.\nSwansea have scored 14 goals in nine league matches under Carvalhal, having scored just 11 in their previous 20 this season before his appointment.\nMan of the match - Ki Sung-yueng (Swansea)\nWhat the managers said\nSwansea boss Carlos Carvalhal: \"I am delighted, I am proud of my players.\n\"There is no secret to success. It is hard work, organisation, patience, dedication and correcting mistakes. We are better and better, we are really strong at the moment.\n\"I put the players in the centre of everything. If you don't have players who follow your ideas you can't achieve anything.\n\"We have trained hard at corners this week, movement, and we scored twice from them. Now we must create another strategy for the next game.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes: \"We conceded from two corners and a penalty. We had no intensity in our play, we thought we could just stroll about.\n\"Winston Reid is conscious, he was knocked out, we are more worried about the injury to his knee than the knock to his head. He's an important player for us so we hope it's not too bad.\n\"We should have saved the first one, we should head the second one away and the third one is a corner and the fourth is a penalty.\n\"We have to be much, much better. We have the players who can do it but getting them to perform is my job.\"\nWhat's next?\nSwansea play away to Huddersfield in the Premier League next Saturday. West Ham host Burnley in their next game on, also on Saturday."

As he broke clear in injury time, it looked like he was shoved in the back by Jamaal Lascelles. Klopp said it was a \"special view\" not to give a foul and \"definitely a red card\" as the forward went down with just the keeper to beat.\n\"I love the goals he's scored, I love his assists. I love this player,\" he added of Salah.\n\"He's doing so well, but all the others have exactly the same importance and he knows that.\"\nSaturday's win moves Liverpool above Manchester United into second place - at least until their rivals play at Crystal Palace on Monday.\nThe gap to leaders Manchester City is 15 points, with Pep Guardiola's side in action at home to Chelsea on Sunday.\nNewcastle, whose best chance saw Mohamed Diame denied by Loris Karius' fine save just before half-time, drop to 16th after Swansea's 4-1 home win over West Ham.\nRafael Benitez's side are two points above the relegation zone with nine matches to play.\nRelive Liverpool 2-0 Newcastle\nSalah just keeps scoring\nThis was Egypt forward Salah's 32nd goal in 38 games in all competitions for Liverpool this season, and the 26th competitive match in which he's scored.\nBy comparison, the entire Newcastle squad has managed 31 goals in total this term.\nHis finish - left-footed, of course, and through the legs of on-loan keeper Martin Dubravka - had a slight element of fortune in that it ricocheted in off Dubravka's calf, but there was no doubt it came with the run of play.\nNewcastle had been camped in banks of five but after Oxlade-Chamberlain, again impressive, pounced on a turnover in possession and opened up space with a determined run and Salah drifted into the perfect spot to put his side ahead. From there they never looked back.\nIn the context of Champions League qualification, Liverpool are now seven points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who have a game in hand, but first comes Tuesday's last-16 second-leg with FC Porto in this year's competition. They lead 5-0 lead from the first leg.\nBigger days to come for Newcastle\nIn recent matches at Manchester City and Bournemouth, Newcastle started games as they did here - stubborn and hard to break down.\nBut just as in their 3-1 defeat at City, and their 2-2 draw at the Cherries (after leading 2-0), resilience washed away.\nThe strategy appeared to be to keep Liverpool at bay for as long as possible and take any chances when they came.\nMaybe if Diame's curling shot - destined for the top corner - had not been brilliantly matched by Karius' glove, the second half would have told a different story.\nRegardless, this defeat at Anfield will not define how Newcastle's season ends. There are more important games to come.\nThree of their nine remaining league matches are against other teams threatened by relegation - and games at home to Southampton and Huddersfield are two of their next three.\nAnalysis: Eye-catching Henderson\nFormer Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day\nJordan Henderson caught my eye because he showed off his passing range. Sometimes he has been criticised for not being positive with his passing but we saw the full range of his passing against Newcastle.\nWhen it comes to England, you think Eric Dier an Jack Wilshere but in terms of defensive capabilities, Henderson is the best.\nMan of the match - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool)\nUnbeaten in 22 - the stats\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 22 successive home league games against Newcastle United. They last lost to them at Anfield in April 1994.\nThe Reds have scored in 22 consecutive home matches against Newcastle - a Premier League record run.\nSalah has scored in each of his past seven games for Liverpool in all competitions - the last player to do so in more was Daniel Sturridge in February 2014, with eight.\nIt took 97 games for Liverpool to reach 200 Premier League goals under Klopp - the only managers to have reached 200 goals quicker with their clubs were Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City (84 games) and Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool (96 games).\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I very often forget the result during the game so even though we were 2-0 up I did feel we had to control the game better.\n\"But then when you step out on the pitch, you realise the wind, so it was difficult to do the right thing in the right moment. We scored two wonderful goals and for sure should have had a penalty but didn't.\n\"They defended really well and are a good team with quality. We lost a few balls we don't usually lose and Roberto Firmino didn't have much support. It caused a few problems but not too many.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez, also speaking to BBC Sport: \"We were playing against a dangerous team. We know they have the pace up front. We managed to 40 minutes then it was a mistake.\n\"We had to go for it in the second half and were then more open. You have to keep the balance to be stronger in the defence and create chances in attack.\n\"We are learning but we are still making mistakes against teams. We are improving but this team has to get points.\n\"I am pleased with the fans. The Liverpool fans were really good for me.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool play FC Porto at home in the Champions League last-16 second leg on Tuesday. They next play in the league at Manchester United on Saturday (12:30 GMT kick-off).\nNewcastle's next match is at home to Southampton in the league on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 2-1 Arsenal\nBrighton beat Arsenal for the first time since 1982 to increase the pressure on Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.\nLewis Dunk put Brighton ahead when he hooked the ball home from a corner after it dropped to him inside the six-yard box.\nThe Seagulls added a second when Laurent Koscielny's misplaced pass was intercepted and Pascal Gross teased a high cross into the box for Glenn Murray to head past Petr Cech.\nArsenal pulled a goal back when Brighton failed to clear their lines. Granit Xhaka fed the ball into Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who cleverly flicked the ball home with the outside of his boot.\nArsenal dominated possession in the second half and had a late chance to equalise through Aubameyang but he could only shoot straight at Mathew Ryan.\nThe Gunners were also fortunate not to have Sead Kolasinac, who had already been booked, sent off for a challenge that ended Ezequiel Schelotto's involvement.\n'Arsenal players getting away with murder'\nWenger concedes top-four finish \"nearly impossible\"\n'As low as it gets for Arsenal' - what next?\nUnder-fire Wenger loses four in a row\nArsenal were meek in back-to-back 3-0 defeats to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley last Sunday and at the Emirates in the Premier League four days later.\nLosing to Pep Guardiola's irresistible champions-elect is one thing, but to a Brighton side battling relegation will not be so palatable for Arsenal fans growing increasingly tired of Wenger's reign.\nIt was the first time the Gunners had lost four consecutive matches since October 2002 in a run that saw them beaten by Everton, Auxerre, Blackburn and Borussia Dortmund.\nFootball Daily Podcast - reaction to Arsenal, Man City v Chelsea & Astori's death\nThey were defending champions that season and ended the campaign as runners-up to Manchester United but retained the FA Cup.\nOver 15 years later and things are not quite so rosy for Wenger with the club seemingly in terminal decline.\nWenger, initially at least, did not look like a man under pressure at the Amex as he warmly embraced Brighton counterpart Chris Hughton and shared a joke with a photographer.\nHowever, by early in the second half with his side 2-1 down his mood darkened and he nervously pulled apart a coffee stirrer as he sat on the bench.\nThe travelling fans, who held up 'Wenger out' banners at the final whistle, will want the Arsenal board to wake up and smell it.\nHas Wenger lost the dressing room?\nWenger's side had breezed past Brighton with a comfortable 2-0 victory when the two teams met at the Emirates in October.\nOn that day the Frenchman celebrated the 21st anniversary of his arrival at the club and his side were level on points with Chelsea, and a point behind bitter rivals Tottenham.\nAfter a bleak winter they find themselves eight points behind the former club, 13 points behind the latter and pinning their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League via the Europa League.\nUnlike the defeats to City, Arsenal had at least shown a bit more fight against Albion but were still well below their best.\nWenger's side have now lost eight matches in all competitions in 2018 - more than any other Premier League team - and the level of performance from his players begs the question of whether they have simply lost faith in Wenger's managerial ability.\nThe chorus of disapproval from ex-Arsenal players grows louder by the week and if that is a barometer for the existing squad then the end of Wenger's tenure is surely drawing closer.\nPointedly he said \"no\" when asked after the match if he was in any way considering his future at the club.\nThe 68-year-old signed a two-year contract in May but even winning the Europa League may not be able to grant him a stay of execution into the 2018-19 season.\nImpressive Brighton edge closer to safety\nArsenal's travails should take nothing away from Brighton, who are now unbeaten in five matches and have moved a step closer to Premier League survival.\nThey matched their top-flight record of three consecutive home victories, last set in September 1982 when that run included a 1-0 victory over Arsenal.\nHughton's side were quickly out of the blocks, clinical in key moments and possessed the workrate and organisation to see the game out.\nThe victory moves them up to 10th place in the table - and gives them a seven-point cushion over 18th-placed Crystal Palace, who face Manchester United on Monday.\nIf the Seagulls can reproduce displays of this ilk from now until the end of the season, then top-fight survival should be a formality.\nMan of the match - Jose Izquierdo (Brighton)\n'We were worthy winners' - what they said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We have to get over this period, recover mentally and physically and we have another game on Thursday against AC Milan and then on Sunday.\n\"It's the first time its happened in my whole career and it's not easy. I have enough experience and desire to turn things around.\n\"When the team struggles for confidence it's even more difficult.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton: \"We are in good form. My biggest disappointment of the game was conceding just before half time because at any level that gives the opponent a lift going into the second half.\n\"The fact we got the two goals early gave us that buffer that we could hang onto but over the 90 minutes I felt we were very worthy winners.\n\"Our intent at the beginning of the game was very good. No complaints with that first half except the goal we conceded before half time. And then we showed the other side of our game - the ugly side - and you need that.\"\nArsenal's away day woes - the stats\nThis was Arsenal's first defeat in 35 Premier League games against a newly promoted side, since losing 2-1 at QPR in March 2012.\nArsenal haven't kept a clean sheet in their last 11 Premier League games, their joint-longest run in the competition.\nArsenal have just 13 points from their 15 away Premier League games this season - their worst return in the top flight since 1989-90.\nPascal Gross has assisted Glenn Murray four times in the Premier League this season - only Cesar Azpilicueta (six for Alvaro Morata) and Kevin de Bruyne (five for Sergio Aguero) have assisted a player more.\nMurray has scored six Premier League goals in 2018 - only Sergio Aguero (9) and Mo Salah (7) have scored more.\nBrighton have won three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Italy to face AC Milan in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday (18:00 GMT) before they host Watford in the Premier League on Sunday at 13:30. Brighton travel to struggling Everton on Saturday, kick-off at 15:00."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-0 Chelsea\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte has defended the use of his tactics in his side's defeat at Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nThe Blues produced a surprisingly negative display and failed to have a shot on target in the match as Bernardo Silva's goal less than a minute into the second half sealed the game and pushed Manchester City 18 points clear at the top and closer to the title.\nSky Sports pundit Gary Neville called Chelsea's display \"absolutely unacceptable\" and accused Conte's players of being \"mannequins\", while colleague Jamie Redknapp called their approach \"anti-football\" and \"a crime against football\".\nThe Italian boss responded: \"You have to accept every critic, but I am not so stupid to play against Manchester City open and to lose 3-0 or 4-0.\n\"A few days ago, Arsenal played twice against them and then you criticised [Arsenal manager Arsene] Wenger a lot because they conceded three goals in only 30 minutes.\n\"The pundit has to use the head to understand when you speak about tactics because I think you must have knowledge to speak about tactics and not only to speak in a stupid way.\"\nWhen asked if Chelsea could have been more ambitious in their play, striker Olivier Giroud, who came on as substitute, said: \"It is a good question. The coach made his tactics. We tried to respect it.\"\nPep Guardiola's side were forced to bide their time before making the breakthrough on Sunday and it came when Silva stole in ahead of Marcos Alonso from David Silva's cross to beat Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\nChelsea did not register a single shot on target, leaving Manchester City keeper Ederson a virtual bystander as he was even able to watch Alonso's timid shot drift wide with seconds left.\nIt was a disappointing day for Chelsea and manager Conte - and of even greater concern is that they are now five points adrift of Tottenham in fourth place in the race for spots in next season's Champions League.\nMan City's winning game of patience\nManchester City's season has been characterised by regular flourishes that will make them worthy Premier League champions when the formalities are finally concluded.\nHere, against a Chelsea side surprisingly devoid of ambition, Guardiola's champions-elect were forced to show patience rather than the dazzling brilliance they have demonstrated on so many occasions.\nChelsea's massed ranks formed a blue wall of defensive defiance, organised and well-drilled, leaving City to enjoy almost total possession and search for any gaps in the barricade assembled by Conte.\nCity, in the manner of champions, played the waiting game, almost unlocking the Blues when Leroy Sane's touch and control created an opening, only for Cesar Azpilicueta to scramble his shot off the line.\nIt was a day for attrition as opposed to artistry and City confirmed they have both sides to their character, punishing Chelsea for a slow start to the second half, Sergio Aguero playing in David Silva, whose cross was met by his namesake Bernardo at the far post.\nIn driving rain, and with Chelsea mysteriously refusing to take off the handbrake, they were able to close out a victory that will, in its own way, have brought as much pleasure to Guardiola as many of the more spectacular wins this season.\nIt was an indication of how they had to keep their head and be patient that they played a total of 902 passes, more than any other team has managed in a Premier League game since 2003-04.\nCity, with a performance that showed their adaptability, edged nearer to the title.\nChelsea pay for cautious approach\nChelsea manager Conte could hardly have been expected to adopt a gung-ho approach to this visit to Manchester City - but his side's negative style became increasingly bewildering as the game went on.\nIt was understandable when the mission was clearly to frustrate City and for 45 minutes it delivered a measure of success as Guardiola's side were restricted - it was after they conceded a goal that matters became confusing.\nChelsea still refused to offer any sign of ambition and even when they did attacks fizzled out tamely, with some ironic cheers from the visiting fans when they won a corner late on and also when Alonso's timid shot drifted wide in stoppage time.\n\"We didn't create any chances. It was complicated,\" said Blues forward Eden Hazard.\n\"Once we had the ball, we were immediately surrounded by three or four players. We wasted some simple passes and we didn't play a good game.\"\nGiroud only appeared as a substitute with 13 minutes left, while Alvaro Morata's introduction came with seconds to go at the expense of Hazard.\n\"When the manager plays me up front, I try to give everything,\" Belgium international Hazard added. \"It's difficult to play a good game when you only touch the ball three times.\n\"If Giroud or Morata had played up front, it would have been easier to play those long balls. With me, it's a little bit more complicated - but I tried my best.\"\nIt was all a far cry from the Chelsea side that showed such ambition and drive to turn a half-time deficit around to win here en route to becoming Premier League champions last season.\nChelsea's tactics could be regarded as a compliment to Manchester City - but they are also a reflection of their own decline this season and how their sights appear to have altered.\nIn the end it was to no avail - leaving them with an uphill task to qualify for the top four.\n'Terrible to watch' - Gullit's analysis of Chelsea's tactics\nMan City's other Silva starts to shine\nDavid Silva has been one of the symbols of Manchester City's success in the new era, playing a crucial role in two title wins and showing his enduring quality with goals in the successive 3-0 wins against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup at Wembley last Sunday and at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday.\nThe 32-year-old Spaniard was at it again here, keeping City ticking over in the tougher moments and playing the crucial cross in the decisive moment of the game.\nAnd it was the man on the end of that cross, his namesake Bernardo Silva, who is now coming into his own after having to bide his time following his \u00a342m summer Manchester City 1-0 Chelseamove from Monaco.\nHe is another diminutive stylist in the mould Guardiola so admires and after waiting his chance he is showing exactly why City were so keen to acquire his services.\nBernardo Silva was also on target against Arsenal on Thursday and is poised to have an increasingly influential say on City's conclusion to the season as Guardiola and his players chase further glory.\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\n'We are behind the boss' - what they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"We are not going to play for the records. Records are always a consequence of what you have done but they are not the main thing.\n\"What really matters is to be champions. I never spoke with the players about the records. Next week at Stoke we are going to try and play like we play all season. After, at the end, we will see.\"\nChelsea striker Olivier Giroud: \"It is not a crisis. We played Manchester United and Manchester City away. These are not small games. We are not happy with that. Obviously we are behind the boss and we are all sticking together.\"\nPep becomes second manager to do double over Conte - stats\nManchester City will end the day 18 points clear at the top of the Premier League, the biggest lead ahead of second place since March 2006, when Chelsea were 18 points ahead of Manchester United.\nChelsea have lost four consecutive away matches in all competitions for the first time since January 2003, when they lost to Man Utd (twice), Leeds and Arsenal.\nPep Guardiola is only the second manager to complete a league double over Antonio Conte, after Delio Rossi (for Sampdoria in 2012/13).\nOnly Sergio Aguero (15) has scored more goals for Manchester City in 2018 in all competitions than Bernardo Silva (5).\nChelsea failed to register a single shot in the first half, the first time they'd not had a shot in the first half of a Premier League game since 2003/04 (when Opta began recording the data).\nThe Blues had just seven shots against Man City in their two Premier League meetings this season, while facing 30 themselves.\nDavid Silva has assisted 12 goals for City in all competitions this season, his most in a campaign since 2011/12, when he assisted 19 goals.\nSilva has assisted 73 Premier League goals since his debut in August 2010, 20 more than any other player in that time.\nWhat next?\nManchester City take on Basel at home in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with progress all but assured courtesy of a 4-0 first-leg win in Switzerland.\nChelsea are in Premier League action, at home against Crystal Palace next Saturday (17:30 GMT), before their own Champions League last-16 second leg away at Barcelona. That tie currently stands at 1-1."

I will be like that until my last day,\" said United boss Jose Mourinho.\n\"You always need that little bit of luck to win a match in the last few minutes. Sometimes the winner is the one who deserves the congratulations but I think Roy Hodgson did everything right.\"\nHodgson's side would have climbed all the way up to 13th place with a win.\nBut, after Chris Smalling's header started a comeback from an improving United, Romelu Lukaku swept in his 99th Premier League goal to pile the pressure on the tiring hosts.\nAnd, with 91 minutes on the clock, Matic smashed in a dipping shot from 25 yards to consign Palace to another week in the drop zone and move United above Liverpool.\nThe two giants meet at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime and Mourinho will know that, despite this win, his team must play far better than they did for most of an underwhelming display at Selhurst Park if they are to beat Jurgen Klopp's men.\nPalace, who will feel deflated to remain 18th after leading through goals from Andros Townsend and Patrick van Aanholt, must take heart for the dogfight ahead from their committed and organised display with 10 first-team players out.\nBut, when seconds away from a point, Matic smashed home to inflict a second costly late home defeat in the space of eight days.\nWho's going down? Pick your bottom three\n'A Groundhog Day moment'\nLast weekend it was Harry Kane and Tottenham who left Palace sickened with a late winner, and a run of six games without a win has hurt their chances of Premier League survival.\n\"It's been a Groundhog Day moment,\" said Hodgson. \"We once again go away with no points and like the game against Tottenham - I thought we deserved something.\n\"I was expecting to come away with one point but once again it is nothing and I feel devastated for the players.\n\"We took the game to Manchester United. If we had drawn the game, I don't think anyone - Jose included - would have said it was a scandal.\"\nA comeback of old?\nFor much of the first hour, United were well off the pace. They had not won any of 28 previous Premier League games in which they had been losing at half-time, and a Fergie-style fightback did not look on the cards in south London.\nPalace were quicker, hungrier, faster to the ball, and it was no surprise when Townsend put them ahead, even if his strike was helped in by a large deflection off Victor Lindelof.\nPaul Pogba summed up his side in the first half, losing the ball on multiple occasions, as the visitors struggled to create anything of note.\nThe second Palace goal epitomised the match up at that point, with Jeffrey Schlupp taking a quick free-kick, United's defence failing to react at all and Van Aanholt running in clear on goal before beating David de Gea and sparking hopes of a maiden Premier League win over United.\nBut, from the moment Smalling headed in Antonio Valencia's cross, the momentum switched as Hodgson failed to make changes and left two strikers on.\nAlexis Sanchez saw his shot deflect on to the crossbar and, though the chance appeared to have gone, Lukaku snaked a shot through five Palace players to find the back of the net.\nDe Gea then made a brilliant save to deny Christian Benteke before Matic won it.\n18th, to 13th, to 18th again - How a thriller unfolded\n11 mins - Andros Townsend's shot deflects in off Victor Lindelof to put Palace ahead. They climb out of the relegation zone and all the way up to 13th place\n48 mins - Patrick van Aanholt sprints away from a sleepy defence to beat David de Gea and spark hopes of a first Premier League win against United\n55 mins - Chris Smalling heads in Antonio Valencia's cross. Comeback on?\n74 mins - Nemanja Matic shot cleared off the line by Christian Benteke\n76 mins - Romelu Lukaku equalises with a low finish after Alexis Sanchez's shot had deflected up on to the crossbar. Palace are back down to 18th\n77 mins - David de Gea makes a superb save to keep out a Christian Benteke header\n83 mins - James McArthur has a great chance but hesitates and can't get a shot away\n89 mins - Wayne Hennessey saves well from Juan Mata\n90+1 mins - Nemanja Matic stuns Selhurst Park and sends United second with a cracking strike\nNo Zaha, no party\nHodgson is fighting the drop with one arm behind his back, with so many players out, but one missing name stands out for them above all else.\nPalace have now lost all nine Premier League games they have played this season without Wilfried Zaha in the side.\nFront two Benteke and Alexander Sorloth worked hard all evening, but once United got back into the game, the Eagles were desperately lacking Zaha's pace and drive on the break.\nHodgson's side missed their chance to climb five places, and the manager's words after their win over Burnley in January suddenly came back in to focus.\nPalace went 12th that day, yet Hodgson wisely said: \"We will be delighted if at the end of the season, we are a point above the relegation zone.\"\nTwo months and six winless games on, that target must remain their focus.\nPalace fans will take heart from not only their performance, but the fact that Hodgson has guided Fulham and West Brom to Premier League safety in the past decade from precarious positions.\nIn 2008, Fulham were six points from safety with 10 games to go but Hodgson steered them to five wins - including victories in each of the last three matches - to stay up on goal difference and send Reading down.\nAnd in 2011, Albion were only a point above the bottom three at the same stage but again, five wins in the last 10 saw them safe.\nPalace face West Brom at Selhurst Park on the final day of the season. That could be massive.\nMan of the match - Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace)\n20 games without a win - the key stats\nManchester United came from 2-0 down to win a Premier League game for the first time since December 2013 (away to Hull).\nThis was also Crystal Palace's first Premier League defeat in a game in which they led by two or more goals.\nCrystal Palace are now winless in 20 league games against Manchester United, extending their longest winless run against a single opponent.\nIndeed, United are unbeaten in all 18 Premier League meetings between the sides, the most a side has faced another without defeat in the competition.\nEight of Andros Townsend's 14 Premier League goals have been from outside the box.\nNemanja Matic's strike was Man Utd's first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League since Marcus Rashford's against Hull in August 2016.\nWhat's next?\nIt does not get easier for Crystal Palace, who travel to Chelsea on Saturday (17:30 GMT), while United host in-form Liverpool at Old Trafford (12:30)."

I don't care what people say. The boys are happy, I'm happy.\"\nWhy Rashford is a must for the World Cup - Waddle analysis\nThe win meant Mourinho's side narrowed the gap on runaway leaders Manchester City to 13 points - at least until City play at Stoke on Monday - but, more pertinently, they are now five points clear of the third-placed Merseysiders.\nRashford, making his first league start since 26 December, will rightly grab the headlines but Romelu Lukaku was instrumental in both goals, and Liverpool simply could not deal with his physical power in the first half.\nFirst, the Belgium striker's header from David de Gea's clearance found Rashford charging into the visitors' box, and he cut inside Trent Alexander-Arnold before firing into the bottom corner.\nFor United's second goal, Lukaku held up the ball from another goal-kick before feeding Juan Mata and, although he could not get a shot away, the ball fell for Rashford to score via a slight deflection from Alexander-Arnold.\nAt that stage Liverpool were second best in every area of the pitch and could have fallen further behind when Mata volleyed acrobatically wide from an Alexis Sanchez cross.\nJurgen Klopp's side improved dramatically after the break and, with United defending deep, the visitors cranked up the pressure without ever really opening up their hosts.\nIt took an own goal for the Reds to reduce the deficit when Eric Bailly turned Sadio Mane's cross past De Gea while attempting to clear at the near post.\nThat gave Liverpool's travelling fans hope but their side could not fashion any further clear chances, even in six often chaotic minutes of stoppage time.\nUnited survived to clinch victory in the first of three games here in the next seven days that will shape their season.\nNext up are Sevilla on Tuesday, with a place in the last eight of the Champions League at stake, before they face Brighton in the FA Cup quarter-finals next Saturday.\nListen - Rashford's World Cup place is safe, says Mourinho\nWhy Marcus Rashford is England World Cup must - Chris Waddle analysis\nFollow the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\n'The human brain is a complex thing'\nIt is the perfect start to a pivotal week for United as Mourinho's side chase more silverware and a guaranteed ticket to next season's Champions League.\nHis side barely made it out of their own half in the second 45 minutes but De Gea only had two routine saves to make as Liverpool failed to break down the organised ranks.\n\"You can be in control without having the ball, you can be in trouble when you have the ball,\" Mourinho said.\n\"It is an important win. The three games in the league, the Champions League and the FA Cup are independent events, with no relation to the next match.\n\"But the human brain is a complex thing. A defeat leaves a bit of damage and victory makes happiness even if you are fatigued.\"\nRussia-bound Rashford returns to run riot\nThe arrival of Sanchez from Arsenal in January has had ramifications for several United players, including Rashford, who had played fewer than 100 minutes in the league as a substitute in 2018 before Saturday.\nRashford has had to wait for his chance but, in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate, he did not waste it. After the match Mourinho suggested that Southgate has already said that Rashford's place at the World Cup is safe.\n\"I spoke with Gareth Southgate a few weeks ago and Gareth told me it doesn't matter if he plays or he doesn't play,\" Mourinho said.\n\"He trusts the kid and the kid goes to the World Cup, so he didn't need to impress Gareth, Gareth knows what he is and Gareth knows that he can give us things at the World Cup.\"\nWith Paul Pogba injured, Sanchez moved inside to play in the hole behind Lukaku, with Rashford and Mata coming back into the team on the left and right.\nAnd while Sanchez again failed to impress, Rashford showed his lack of minutes has not affected his sharpness or his appetite in front of goal.\nThe 20-year-old now has 12 goals in all competitions this season, making this his most prolific campaign yet, and he received a standing ovation when he was replaced - although some fans were not happy he was withdrawn.\n\"The fans they can do what they want, I'm not upset at all with that reaction,\" Mourinho said.\nA reality check for Liverpool's defence\nJurgen Klopp's side had conceded only one goal in their previous five games but any suggestions that their problems at the back might be over quickly disappeared in a fractious first half.\nLukaku bullied the Reds centre-halves Dejan Lovren and Virgil van Dijk throughout the first period and the carnage that the big Belgian caused allowed his team-mates to capitalise.\nTrue, Liverpool were disjointed all over the pitch before the break, but they were especially disappointing at the back, which is where the damage was done.\nThe Reds did improve in the second half when they at last managed some meaningful possession, but they struggled to break down a well-drilled United back-line.\nBailly's own goal means Liverpool are now the highest-scoring away side in Europe's big five leagues, with 35 on their travels, but this was not one of their attack's better days.\nWith space at a premium for Mane and Mohamed Salah, their forays forward lacked their usually lethal punch and, other than pick the ball out of the back of his net, De Gea had little else to do.\nKlopp felt his side should have had a penalty when substitute Fellaini tackled Mane inside the area, but genuine scares for the hosts were few and far between.\n\"It was a clear penalty with Fellaini on Mane, in situations like this you need the right decision,\" he said.\n\"It is all about the result and we lost.\n\"We chased the game in the second half and caused them problems but this is a result game and they have the result and we don't.\"\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United)\nWhat they said:\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We were quite aggressive in the first half, we wanted to have control of the game, spaces for transition and to try to exploit - not weaknesses - but points where the opponent is not so good.\n\"The second half it was not our intention to be as defensive as we were. Liverpool pushed us back but I don't remember the chances that needed David de Gea to make the goal safe. I don't remember a dangerous situation to our goal. It was control by them having the ball and control by us without the ball. I think we deserved the three points.\"\nWas this good preparation for the Champions League?\n\"The three games in the league, the Champions League and the FA Cup are independent events, with no relation to the next match. The human brain is a complex thing. The defeat leaves a bit of damage and victory makes happiness even if you are fatigued. The best thing was to win this match.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was 2-0 down of course - not a good idea against Manchester United. Lukaku is one of the best strikers in the world, we needed to be around to pick up the ball, we were not and Rashford could use the situation twice.\n\"We had opportunities to shoot from distance but we were not good enough, we did not score and had to chase the game in the second half. We did that, scored one and I think everyone agrees it was a penalty [Fellaini's tackle on Mane] but that doesn't help us now.\n\"It is very important [we bounce back] we have no time to waste.\n\"We chased the game in the second half and caused them problems, but this is a result game and they have the result and we don't.\"\nTwo shots on target, two goals\nManchester United beat Liverpool for the 68th time in league competition; this is the most defeats Liverpool have suffered against a single side.\nManchester United have won four of their eight games against fellow 'big six' sides in the Premier League this season (W4 D1 L3), twice as many as they managed in the whole of last season (W2 D4 L4).\nLiverpool have won only one of their seven Premier League games on the weekends immediately after a Champions League game this season (W1 D4 L2).\nManchester United have won 20 of their 30 Premier League games this season, already surpassing their totals in both 2016-17 (18) and 2015-16 (19) and equalling their number of league wins in 2014-15 (20).\nOnly Manchester United (67) have profited from more own goals in the Premier League than Liverpool (58).\nManchester United had just two shots on target in this match - both of which were scored by Marcus Rashford.\nRashford has scored with 29% of his shots in the Premier League against 'big six' clubs, compared to 10% against the other teams.\nRashford has scored seven of his 16 Premier League goals against teams in the 'big six' (44%).\nRomelu Lukaku now has seven Premier League assists this season; more than in any previous campaign.\nWhat next?\nManchester United look to join Liverpool and neighbours Manchester City in the last eight of the Champions League when they play the second leg of their last-16 tie with Sevilla on Wednesday (kick-off 19:45 GMT), after a 0-0 draw in Spain.\nMourinho's men return to domestic action on Saturday when they host Brighton in the FA Cup quarter-finals (19:45 GMT) and their next Premier League game is after the international break, when they play Swansea on Saturday, 31 March (15:00 GMT) in what will be their fourth successive game at Old Trafford.\nLiverpool are out of the FA Cup but they are in league action next weekend, when they play Watford at Anfield on Saturday (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 3-0 Southampton\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino accused some of his players of \"giving up\" during their 3-0 defeat at Newcastle.\nKenedy scored twice for the Magpies, with his first coming after just 63 seconds, and Matt Ritchie added a third as the hosts eased their relegation fears with a fine win that leaves them five points clear of safety in 13th.\nBut Pellegrino's team were desperately poor and are just a point above the relegation zone in 17th.\n\"The spirit of the team and the attitude is everything,\" the Argentine said. \"We have been talking about this a lot.\n\"You can have good players, you can have a budget, but without personality and spirit, it's really difficult to compete at this level.\n\"When you concede in the first minute, you feel the game will be tough and every single negative impact is massive for you.\n\"I observed some players who gave up and we cannot show this. We were never a threat for Newcastle.\"\nRelive Newcastle v Southampton as it happened\nKenedy scored his first goal since joining Newcastle on loan from Chelsea when he collected Jonjo Shelvey's pass on his chest, spun and shot on the half-volley past Alex McCarthy.\nThe Brazilian doubled the advantage when he finished off a quick counter-attack following a Southampton corner after good work by Ayoze Perez and Dwight Gayle.\nThe hosts added a third in the second half when Shelvey set up the unmarked Ritchie, who steered his shot from 20 yards into the bottom corner.\nSouthampton's best chance fell to substitute Josh Sims, but his 20-yard strike was well saved by Martin Dubravka.\nBenitez's Newcastle continue to impress\nThis result, which came after Newcastle beat Manchester United in their previous home game, again highlights the great job Rafael Benitez is doing in trying circumstances.\nWith owner Mike Ashley wanting to sell the club and a proposed takeover falling through in January, Benitez was left without money to sign any players in the latest transfer window.\nInstead, the ex-Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid boss took three players on loan - impressive goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from Sparta Prague, Brazil Under-23 international Kenedy from Chelsea, and striker Islam Slimani from Leicester, who is yet to play for Newcastle because of injury.\nKenedy had only played five cup games for Chelsea this season, with his hopes of first-team football at the London club not helped when he was sent home from a pre-season tour of China after ill-advised Instagram posts.\nToday, he was excellent. With barely a minute gone, Shelvey played the ball over the top and Kenedy showed great skill to jump, take the ball on his chest, spin past defender Cedric Soares and give Newcastle the lead.\nHis second goal came less than 30 seconds after Southampton had taken a corner. Saints midfielder Mario Lemina failed to connect with a shot, Perez led a counter-attack and played it into Gayle, whose first-time unselfish pass gave Kenedy a tap-in.\nNewcastle's third goal was helped by more poor Saints defending as an unmarked Shelvey passed to Ritchie, who had time and space to guide a low shot into the bottom corner.\nWoeful Saints need to improve\nSouthampton are playing in their sixth consecutive season in the Premier League, and have not finished lower than 14th in any of the previous five campaigns.\nBut they must improve dramatically on this performance if they are going to have another year in the top flight.\nThey had 63% of the ball, but did little with it and did not register a shot on target in the first half.\nThey were not helped by some terrible defending as they gave Shelvey far too much space to play in passes for the first and third goals, and to concede less than 30 seconds after taking a corner is not good enough in the top flight.\nSaints midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was unhappy with the performance of his side and said: \"There is no chance of us going out like this again next week. We are much better than this, we have no excuses.\"\nThe result will also put the future of manager Mauricio Pellegrino, who played under Benitez at Liverpool and Valencia, in doubt.\nPellegrino was appointed in the summer, when an eighth-placed finish and League Cup final appearance were deemed not enough for former boss Claude Puel to keep his job.\nThis result means Southampton have won just once in their past 17 league games, but what may be of greater concern was the manner of their defeat and their capitulation.\nThe Saints have eight games left to secure their survival, including tricky-looking fixtures against Arsenal, Chelsea, Leicester, Everton and Manchester City, although their fixtures also include matches against bottom-half teams Swansea, West Ham and Bournemouth.\n'Southampton were borderline disgraceful' - analysis\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on Match of the Day\nNewcastle were brilliant, they had a game plan and they bullied Southampton from minute one and Southampton did not know how to handle them.\nIn the midfield, Jonjo Shelvey and Mohamed Diame were solid and Newcastle won most of the second balls.\nIt is worrying times for Southampton. They were abysmal, shocking, borderline disgraceful. They did not seem to have any plan and a lot of it was passing for the sake of passing.\nTheir players seemed to take the easier option every time and at half-tempo. I really fear for Mauricio Pellegrino.\nMan of the match - Kenedy (Newcastle)\nSouthampton concede another goal from outside the area - the stats\nNewcastle kept a clean sheet for the first time in 13 league games against Southampton, since a 1-0 win in October 2003.\nThe Magpies scored as many goals this afternoon as they had in their previous six combined at St James' Park in the Premier League (three).\nMatt Ritchie's strike was the 12th goal Southampton have conceded from outside the box in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nKenedy's opener was his first in the Premier League for Newcastle and his second overall in the competition. His first came after 39 seconds (vs Norwich in March 2016), while the first goal today came with 63 seconds on the clock.\nKenedy is the first Newcastle player to score twice at St James' Park in the Premier League since Georginio Wijnaldum in May 2016.\nAfter a run of 10 Premier League games without a goal or assist, Dwight Gayle has had a hand in four goals in his last four appearances in the competition (two goals, two assists).\nJonjo Shelvey provided two assists in a Premier League game for the fourth time in total, and the first time since May 2015 for Swansea against Stoke.\n'We did not represent the club' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino said: \"The first goal in the first minute had a massive impact on my players. From this moment we could not react, the spirit of the team was really poor. Without spirit, without character, we can play badly and we can have a difficult day.\n\"We have to show the spirit and that's the biggest problem today. I have not seen one game this season like this at all.\n\"When you do not play a good game, you have to show you are on the pitch, even running, even fighting, even playing football, and do the best we can. The worst thing was the attitude.\n\"We are in this position for a good reason, but we still have eight games and we are still alive. We have to say sorry to the fans. We did not represent the club with the values that the club has got.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez said: \"We knew it was a massive game for us, against a team close to us in the table. We needed to do well. The players approached it well, the intensity they showed, they way they moved the ball, it was very pleasing.\n\"You need a bit of luck score early. We scored a second and needed the third just to kill the game. You could see the hard work they put in for the clean sheet. When you see the players working so hard, as a manager you have to be pleased.\n\"We know Southampton have most of possession in their games, and after the goal they had to take the risk and attack. So we can be organised. When you play against a team who have possession and pass a lot, you have to defend well and counter attack.\n\"Five points [above the relegation zone] is good but there is still plenty to do. I have confidence in the team that we can do it.\"\nWhat's next?\nNewcastle have a three-week gap before their next fixture as they are not in action again until 31 March, when they entertain Huddersfield Town.\nThis was the first of four successive away games for Southampton. They next play in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup against League One Wigan Athletic on Sunday, 18 March. Their next Premier League game is at West Ham on 31 March."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 0-0 Swansea City\nSwansea manager Carlos Cavalhal praised his side's \"epic\" performance after they hung on for a point at Huddersfield despite playing most of the game with 10 men.\nJordan Ayew was shown a straight red card by referee Michael Oliver after only 11 minutes after he caught Huddersfield captain Jonathan Hogg on the leg with his studs.\nCarvalhal said that Huddersfield \"played opera\" and Swansea \"had to listen to their music for a long time,\" keeping with a music-related theme a week after he said his side had made West Ham \"dance to rock n'roll\" in their 4-1 win last Saturday.\n\"But the most important thing is that in the end, we achieved what we wanted. It was an epic point,\" the Portuguese added.\nThe Terriers dominated after Ayew's dismissal but could not force a way through, going close when Steve Mounie's volley was brilliantly touched onto the bar by Lukasz Fabianski.\nTom Ince hit the post in the last minute of normal time for the hosts, but Swansea held out for a remarkable draw after not having one shot in the entire match.\nRelive the action\nAll of Saturday's Premier League action\nSwansea and Huddersfield drop one place in the Premier League table to 14th and 15th respectively, four points above the relegation zone.\nA back-header from Mounie looped over the Swansea bar before half-time, while Hogg and Florent Hadergjonaj went close with shots from distance after the break.\nThe Swans' rearguard action was such that Carvalhal's side only touched the ball once inside the Huddersfield area, while the home side had 80.8% possession.\nSwans fight a crucial rearguard\nSwansea had sunk to the very bottom of the Premier League when Carvalhal took over in late December, but a dramatic 2-1 win at Watford in the Portuguese's first match in charge began a change in the Welsh club's fortunes.\nThe former Sheffield Wednesday boss has galvanised the Swansea squad to the tune of five wins and three draws in 10 league outings since. And Ayew's red card so early on makes this point all the more valuable.\nIt was an outstanding defensive effort from the remaining players, with Andre Ayew regularly tracking back from up front to get the ball clear following the dismissal of his brother.\nThe Swans rode their luck at times, and must be grateful for their keeper's brilliant contribution to keep Mounie's effort at bay to grind out what could prove to be a crucial result.\nCarvalhal - the analogies just keep on coming\nSince taking over at the Liberty Stadium, Carvalhal has made several entertaining analogies when describing his side's fortunes.\nThe 52-year-old has said that:\nSwansea made West Ham \"dance to rock n'roll\"\nHis game-changing substitutions v Burnley were like \"putting all the meat in the barbeque\"\nHe might have to sign \"sardines\" rather than \"lobsters\" in the transfer window\nThat battling to avoid relegation is like trying to extinguishing a forest fire\nAnd he has handed out custard tarts to reporters at a press conference.\nOpportunity missed for Terriers\nHuddersfield failed to score for the 16th time in the league this season despite being up against 10 men for most of the match.\nIn addition to the shots that hit the woodwork and flew wide, defender Scott Malone missed out when the ball went between his legs as he leapt to connect with a cross inside the area.\nBut for all the possession they enjoyed, David Wagner's side must see this as a missed opportunity when it comes to their battle to stay in the top flight.\nThere were signs of frustration as the game wore on, such as when Ince connected to a cross that seemed to be heading towards the better-placed Mounie.\nInce's header flew wide, but he was desperately unlucky when his late effort hit the upright with Fabianski stranded.\nBut luck didn't play a part when Mounie's thumping volley, which was heading just under the crossbar, was magnificently tipped onto the bar by Swansea's keeper.\nMan of the Match - Lukasz Fabianski (Swansea)\nWhat the managers said\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"We're frustrated about the result, but the boys did everything right apart from score. We hit the bar and post three times and missed other chances. Sometimes you need luck and that wasn't on our side today.\n\"We played the overload quite well. I will only praise my players for how they played it. We had everything apart from the goal. We have to accept this point and the performance.\n\"It could be an important point at the end, even though I thought we deserved all three.\"\nSwansea boss Carlos Carvalhal: \"It was a happy point because we were down to 10 players very early. It didn't look like a red card at the first moment but when I look again what my player did was exactly the same as the Huddersfield player did. It was strange.\n\"My team was really brave. They defended very well. It is not the sort of game I want, in the end it was a little bit lucky but the luck I think was completely deserved for how my players played with their fight.\n\"We showed another face of our character. We didn't have the conditions in this game to get more than one point.\"\nShot-shy Swans - the stats\nThere have been three occasions of a team having more than 25 shots in a Premier League match but failing to score this season - all of them have been against Swansea City - Southampton: 29, Tottenham: 26 and Huddersfield: 30.\nSwansea became only the third side to fail to have a single shot in a Premier League match after West Bromwich Albion against Manchester City in December 2004 (drew 1-1) and Blackburn against Tottenham in April 2012 (lost 0-2).\nHuddersfield have failed to score in a league-high 16 Premier League games this season.\nHuddersfield's possession figure of 80.84% is the second highest in a Premier League game (since 2003-04), after Manchester City's 82.28 against QPR in May 2012.\nJordan Ayew's red card after 11 minutes was the earliest a player has been sent off in the Premier League this season, and earliest in the competition since Jeff Hendrick against Watford in February 2017 (six minutes).\nIt was also Swansea's first red card in the competition since Kyle Naughton was sent off against Sunderland in January 2016 - they'd gone 84 games without one before Saturday's game.\nWhat's next?\nThe Terriers are back in action at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday, 17 March at 15:00 GMT. Swansea host Tottenham in the FA Cup on the same day at 12:15, but don't play in the Premier League until 15:00 BST on 31 March, against Manchester United at Old Trafford."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce said his players \"accepted the pressure\" and delivered a \"big win\" against 10-man Brighton at Goodison Park.\nBrighton frustrated the Toffees, who had lost three of the past four games, for an hour before they self-destructed to hand Allardyce's side three points.\nGaetan Bong's own goal broke the deadlock before Cenk Tosun's quality finish - his second in as many games - doubled the lead.\nBrighton finished with 10 men after Anthony Knockaert's wild challenge on Leighton Baines.\nWayne Rooney missed a late penalty but Allardyce declared himself happy with his side's performance.\n\"The players had to handle the pressure,\" he said. \"Our form away, that's been a long standing problem and it was a big win under those circumstances.\n\"The players accepted the pressure and delivered a performance.\"\nReaction from Goodison Park\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nRelive the action from Goodison\nSaturday's Premier League stats\nTosun warming to life at Everton\nThis was a much-needed win for Allardyce and his players.\nEverton started the day 11th in the table, closer to the relegation zone than a place in Europe.\nThis result lifted them up to ninth and means they will host runaway leaders Manchester City on 31 March on the back of three successive home wins.\nIt has been a frustrating season for the Toffees after spending \u00a3150m last summer, but at least Tosun is starting to flourish after arriving from Turkey in a \u00a327m deal in January.\nHis first goal at Goodison Park - a quality finish from just inside the penalty area after Leighton Baines' pass - sealed victory.\nEverton had taken the lead when Yannick Bolasie's sumptuous curling cross, intended for Theo Walcott, hit Bong on the shin and flew past keeper Mathew Ryan.\nKnockaert's ill-discipline allowed Everton to comfortably see out the match, despite Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan saving Rooney's late penalty.\nThe spot-kick was awarded when Shane Duffy brought down substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nCalvert-Lewin had replaced Walcott, whose suspected calf injury will be a concern for Allardyce on an otherwise positive day.\n\"Usually when you lose two games and in the way that we've lost them, you have to find a response from the players,\" added Allardyce.\n\"At Goodison, I don't think there's been a problem. Our big problem has been away from home.\"\nKnockaert lets down Brighton\nThis was Brighton's first visit to Goodison Park in 36 years. Barring a disastrous end to the season, the Seagulls will be back next season.\nDespite the defeat, the Seagulls need six points from eight games to reach 40 - the magic number that is supposedly needed to guarantee Premier League survival.\nTheir plan to frustrate Everton was working well until Bong's own goal, while Knockaert's ill-discipline cost his side any chance of a comeback.\nThe former Leicester man became the first Brighton player to be sent of in the Premier League after a reckless challenge on Baines.\nWhat will concern Seagulls boss Chris Hughton more is his side's lack of goals away from home.\nThey have managed just seven on their travels in the league since their promotion, and this was the 14th time they have failed to score in a Premier League game this season.\n\"We fell well below the standards we've set and the level we needed to get a result,\" Hughton said after the end of his side's seven-match unbeaten run.\n\"We restricted Everton to minimal chances going into half time. Once the first goal went in, it lifted the crowd and it became very difficult.\"\nMan of the match - Cenk Tosun (Everton)\nTop of the own goal charts - the stats\nBrighton have scored five own goals this season - two more than any other side in the league.\nWayne Rooney is the first player since Darren Bent in 2009-10 to miss three penalties in a Premier League season.\nBrighton were the 41st different opponents Sam Allardyce has faced in the Premier League, while Derby remain the only side he's failed to beat in England's top-flight (P4 W0 D1 L3).\nEverton have won seven consecutive Premier League home games against newly promoted sides for the first time in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nIf Everton's season had run smoothly, they might be planning for an FA Cup quarter-final tie next. Instead, they face struggling Stoke City away next Saturday (15:00 GMT) in the Premier League.\nBrighton can park their Premier League campaign for three weeks as thoughts now drift towards next Saturday's FA Cup sixth round tie at Manchester United (19:45 GMT) before the international break."

Ashley Barnes' emphatic opener prompted anger to boil over in the stands and a fan ran on to the pitch. There had been a small protest by some home supporters before the game too, but the Burnley goal triggered chaos.\nThe repeated pitch invasions cannot have helped the focus of the home players, who wilted as Burnley scored another two.\nWest Ham have now won only one of their last seven league games, claiming just five points from a possible 21 during this run.\nWith just eight games remaining, and a two-week break because of FA Cup matches (which they are not involved in) and international football, Moyes must find a way to rebuild his players' confidence.\n'I understand fans' feelings, but this isn't the answer' - Lampard\nFormer West Ham midfielder Frank Lampard, speaking on Match of the Day:\n\"It was very toxic today in the second half in particular with fans coming onto the pitch.\n\"Mark (Noble) is Mr West Ham and he cares - that's why he reacts this way. This isn't right whatever way you look at it.\n\"I understand the fans' feelings. They've moved to a new stadium and wanted to fight for Europe but the club has gone backwards and the fans are asking questions. The net spend is not enough.\n\"But a demonstration mid game isn't the answer.\"\nWood makes big difference again\nWinning can become a habit and after claiming their first victory in 12 league games against Everton last week, Burnley have another.\nThis triumph over West Ham, their first back-to-back wins since December, was testament to a vastly improved second half.\nThey did not have a shot on target and rode their luck before the break, but it all changed - again - when Dyche brought Wood off the bench.\nThe towering Kiwi suddenly leading the line with Barnes made a big difference.\nWood, who created Barnes' opener, is the first player to be involved in three Premier League goals as a substitute since Everton's Steven Naismith in 2015, and he has a knack for making things happen.\nBeing able to leave him out after he made such a big impact last week suggests Dyche has genuine strength in depth.\nBurney will need it as they pursue sixth place and Europa League qualification.\nBut the Clarets manager can point to his team's impressive mentality as evidence they can keep going, having stuck to their task amid the second-half drama and plundered three goals.\nMan of the match - Chris Wood (Burnley)\n'You can't cross the line' - what they said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes told BBC Match of the Day: \"Up until the goal you wouldn't have thought that it would have been such a bad day. We had played well enough to be in front but the first goal quickly altered things.\n\"We want the supporters behind us, since I've been here they've been really good. But you can't cross the line and come on the pitch.\n\"A lot of my players did well with the way they acted.\n\"We still have plenty of games, we are good enough and we will be out of the bottom three come the end of the season. I'm confident we have the players here.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche told Match of the Day: \"They were the better side in the first half, we had to do the ugly stuff to stay in it.\n\"We have to focus on ourselves.\n\"You can't play like we did in the first half and expect to get things out of the game.\n\"The first marker was to be better than last season. We have played better and now we have 43 points, the highest in the Premier League era. That's pleasing with eight games to go.\"\nWest Ham can't stop conceding - the stats\nWest Ham United have lost three league games in a row by a margin of three or more goals for the first time since March 2008.\nBurnley have now recorded their highest points tally in a single Premier League season (43), with eight games still to spare.\nAshley Barnes has scored in three successive appearances for Burnley - the last time he scored in three successive games was in May 2011 for Brighton (four games).\nBurnley did not manage a single shot on target until the 66th minute of this match, which Ashley Barnes scored with. The Clarets then scored with their second shot on target three minutes later.\nOverall, Burnley scored three goals despite posting just four shots on target in this match.\nOf goalkeepers to have appeared in at least four matches this season, Joe Hart has the worst goals-conceded-per-game average (2.2 per game).\nDavid Moyes has faced Sean Dyche five times as manager in all competitions, failing to win a single meeting (D2 L3).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham host Southampton on Saturday, 31 March (15:00 GMT), while Burnley travel to the Hawthorns to face West Brom on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-4 Leicester City\nWest Brom boss Alan Pardew's position is under further scrutiny after a heavy defeat by Leicester left the Baggies eight points adrift of safety.\nThe hosts had taken the lead when Salomon Rondon produced a close-range finish from Oliver Burke's low cross.\nLeicester equalised in spectacular fashion when Jamie Vardy volleyed crisply past Ben Foster from Riyad Mahrez's ball over the top.\nMahrez then got on the scoresheet himself after half-time when he coolly finished after a clever pass from Kelechi Iheanacho.\nFormer Manchester City striker Iheanacho put the game beyond West Brom when he headed in Ben Chilwell's cross.\nLeicester completed the rout in injury time when Vicente Iborra headed home from a corner.\nWith fixtures against Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham to come in their remaining eight matches, West Brom's survival hopes look forlorn.\nPardew's long-term prospects are equally bleak with just one victory since he was appointed successor to Tony Pulis in October.\n'Baggies owners might thing change is better'\nAll the reaction from Saturday's matches\nRe-live all the action from Leicester's win\nWhat does this mean for Pardew?\nLeicester sacked Craig Shakespeare as manager when these two sides drew 1-1 at the King Power Stadium in October.\nThere had been speculation Pardew would only get one more match to save his job and defeat could spell the end of his brief tenure.\nHowever, the vibe from The Hawthorns before kick-off was that the 56-year-old will stays in charge until the end of the season come what may.\nWhether this loss changes the opinion of West Brom's owner Lai Guochuan in the coming days remains to be seen.\nThe Chinese entrepreneur will surely have been unimpressed by the second-half capitulation on Saturday.\nWest Brom had actually shown some fight in the first period, sensing it was now or never to deliver a performance.\nAs soon as they fell behind the life appeared to be sucked out of West Brom's players, though, and the Foxes were merciless in their approach.\nThe decline at the West Midlands club looks terminal and Pardew's chances of being in charge beyond the end of campaign look virtually non existent.\nVardy shows no signs of slowing up\nVardy turned 31 in January but if the late blooming of his career continues at the same speed with which he runs on to defence-splitting passes, there is plenty more to come.\nThe England international's first goal was a thing of beauty.\nVardy hovvered on the line of the West Brom defence, watched Mahrez's ball over the top of the backline drop over his shoulder before striking a crisp, low volley into the corner of the net.\nThe Hawthorns clearly brings the best out of him - Vardy has scored in all four of his Premier League appearances against West Brom at the ground.\nHe has also either scored or assisted 15 goals this season. Only he and Mahrez - with 18 - have been directly involved in at least 14 goals this season and play for clubs outside the top six.\nBut Vardy is much more than just a goalscorer and showed as much here. He was a constant pest to the Baggies' defenders, brought team-mates into play and made dangerous runs.\nTalks about a film of Vardy's meteoric rise from non-league football to the Premier League are \"ongoing\" his agent John Morris said\n, external\nin September 2017.\nIf he continues in this form, particularly with a World Cup to come this summer, then there may yet be more unwritten chapters to come in the Vardy story.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Leicester)\n'We found a clinical edge' what they said\nWest Brom boss Alan Pardew: \"You have to fight. You have to fight until the end. I don't care whatever job or workplace you are in.\n\"If you are under pressure and you are not going to fight, then don't bother turning up.\n\"I am not going to lay down tools because I am saying to the players they have to fight until the end.\"\nLeicester boss Claude Puel: \"It was a crucial win because we have drawn some games at home\n\"We found a clinical edge. The first half was end to end and a very open game with chances for both sides.\nIt could have been 3-3 at half-time. It was important to manage the game in the second half and we were clever, with good quality and scored fantastic goals.\"\nHome side struggles continue - the stats\nThe side which hosts this fixture have failed to win in eight Premier League meetings.\nWest Brom have dropped a league-high 21 points from winning positions in the top flight this season.\nThe Baggies have now lost six Premier League games in a row. They last lost seven straight games between February and April 2003 when they were relegated.\nMahrez has now been involved in 18 Premier League goals this season (10 goals, eight assists) - twice as many as last season (nine - six goals, three assists).\nWest Brom striker Rondon's goal was his 22nd Premier League strike - since the start of 2015-16, he has scored 12 more goals for the side than any other player.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom travel to Bournemouth for a Premier League game next Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off). Leicester host Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-finals at the King Power Stadium the following day at 16.30."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-1 Crystal Palace\nChelsea revived their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish as they got back to winning ways with a victory over lowly Crystal Palace.\nThe Blues remain fifth but their win saw Antonio Conte's team narrow the gap on fourth-placed Tottenham to two points - at least until Spurs play Bournemouth on Sunday.\nBrazil winger Willian opened the scoring for the hosts, aided by a deflection off Palace defender Martin Kelly, with a shot that crept inside the left-hand post.\nChelsea spurned several excellent openings before doubling their advantage, again thanks to significant chunk of good fortune.\nKelly was again involved, with the former Liverpool player initially doing well to clear Davide Zappacosta's drive off his own goal line - only for the ball to ricochet off Eagles goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey and strike Kelly before entering the net.\nEden Hazard had a goal disallowed for offside and Chelsea's profligacy threatened to give Roy Hodgson's team a route back into the match.\nPatrick van Aanholt's late goal briefly raised their hopes, but Conte's side held on with Palace remaining in the bottom three.\nChelsea back in business\nAfter defeats to both Manchester clubs had weakened their grip on a Champions League place, this represented a welcome three points for Chelsea, who dominated proceedings from start to finish.\nConte had been heavily criticised in the aftermath of their defeat by Manchester City last Sunday for showing a lack of ambition, underlined by his decision play without a centre-forward.\nOn Saturday, though, the return of Olivier Giroud - starting his third game for the Blues since his transfer from Arsenal in January - provided a welcome focal point.\nIt also released Hazard to occupy his customary position on the left of a considerably more fluent Chelsea attack that was bolstered by Willian's strong running.\nOnly miraculous defending from James Tomkins prevented the France forward from capping his display with his first league goal for the Blues.\nGiroud continued in the same vein after the break, posing a threat and linking with Chelsea's midfield until his withdrawal.\nTellingly, when Conte did decide to withdraw him, he retained the shape of his team by introducing another forward in the form of Alvaro Morata. By the time his team conceded a late goal they had peppered the Palace goal with 27 shots and more than merited their win.\nFormation backfires on Palace\nChelsea capitalised on Roy Hodgson's decision to deploy a conventional 4-4-2 formation. Cesc Fabregas and N'Golo Kante controlled the central areas against the visitors, who were also outnumbered when Willian and Hazard dropped deep to collect the ball.\nWith neither Christian Benteke nor Alexander Sorloth offering any support, it left James McArthur and Luka Milivojevic badly exposed and unable to get close enough to apply any pressure onto their opposite numbers.\nThe hosts enjoyed 68.5% possession in the first half en route to establishing a two-goal advantage.\nIn contrast, the visitors - who were profligate when they did gain possession of the ball - mustered just two efforts on the Chelsea goal and both missed the target.\nDespite a late rally, draws against West Ham and Newcastle now seem an age ago for the Eagles.\nTheir relative success in both those fixtures was anchored to fielding a five-man midfield and supporting a lone forward with pace in the form of Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha.\nSince the decision to utilise a second central striker, they have suffered four consecutive defeats - to Everton, Tottenham, Manchester United and now Chelsea.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea)\n'We deserved to win'\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte speaking to BT Sport:\nOn his sides's performance: \"We created a lot of chances to score a lot of goals today. We conceded 2-1 at the end and there's a bit of pressure, but did well to keep the ball high up the pitch way from our box.\n\"We deserved to win. We played a good game, especially in the first half, against a good Crystal Palace. They are a good team fighting a lot to avoid relegation.\"\nOn scuppered chances: \"We tried to finish the game, but I think their goalkeeper made good saves and we hit the post. For sure, when you have so many chances it is important to be clinical - but we must be pleased with the performance of the team and prepare for Barcelona.\"\nOn Giroud: \"Olivier was unlucky. Two clear chances to score - he hit the post and another was a deflection by the defender - but his commitment was good for the team and we have to continue in this way.\"\nOn Barcelona preparations: \"We have to prepare for that game in the right ways They are a strong team, the game will be totally different compared to today, but we have three days to decide with the players the right plan.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson speaking to BT Sport:\nOn his team's performance: \"I was very disappointed in the first half. [It wasn't] the football I know we can play. We were not aggressive enough, we gave them too much space and they scored two goals.\n\"The second half was better, much more like performances I've been seeing and we can count ourselves a little unlucky. We had a goal chalked off from Sorloth - on another day maybe that isn't.\n\"We were taking the game to Chelsea late on and asking questions of them to the point that they had to waste a bit of time at the end.\"\nOn his opponents: \"The quality of their passing was fantastic, particularly from Fabregas. It's that quality they're capable of showing that gave them a 2-0 lead. If we try to attack and open ourselves up we're in danger on the counter from players like Hazard and Willian, who are very quick. I'm more satisfied with the second-half performance.\"\nOn Zaha's return: \"Great to have him back. We need to be careful. He's a wonderful footballer who makes us better, but we can't think we'll be fine because he's back, he's one player out of 11. He's a footballer, not a magician.\"\nWillian's best return for Chelsea\nChelsea posted 27 shots in this game - their most in a Premier League game this season and since 21 May 2017 against Sunderland (28).\nChelsea have now conceded just five goals in their past 10 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge.\nCrystal Palace have won just two points in their past seven Premier League matches.\nThis was the 10th game this season that Zaha has not started for Crystal Palace in the Premier League - they have not won a single point in any of these games.\nWillian has now scored 13 goals for Chelsea this season - his best return in a single campaign for the club.\nWillian has had a hand in 17 goals in his past 18 starts for Chelsea in all competitions (12 goals, five assists).\nVan Aanholt's consolation goal for Palace was the 800th scored in the Premier League this season.\nWhat next?\nChelsea travel to Barcelona on Wednesday in the Champions League to play the second leg of their last-16 tie (kick-off 19:45 GMT). The first game ended in a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.\nConte's team return to domestic action on Sunday 18 March when they face Leicester City in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the East Midlands (16:30 GMT), their fourth game away from home in the last five.\nCrystal Palace are out of the FA Cup but they are in league action next weekend when they play Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-0 Watford\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger said his team had to \"get the fans back on our side again\" after ending a run of three successive Premier League defeats with a fine win over Watford.\nDespite an official attendance of 59,131, there were empty seats all around the Emirates with a number of season-ticket holders seemingly put off by the Gunners' disappointing league season.\nGoals from Shkodran Mustafi, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan gave Wenger's side their first league win since beating Everton 5-1 on 3 February.\n\"We had a disappointing period and our supporters suffered like we suffered,\" said Wenger.\n\"But our job is to perform and to stick together in difficult moments, and to get the fans back on our side again.\"\nRelive Arsenal versus Watford as it happened\nWatford, beaten for only the second time in six matches, saw Troy Deeney's penalty saved by Petr Cech, who registered the 200th Premier League clean sheet of his career to become the first keeper to reach that mark.\nThe win leaves the Gunners sixth, 12 points behind fourth-placed Liverpool, who are in the final Champions League spot.\nHowever, Arsenal could still qualify for next season's Champions League if they win the Europa League, and that competition affected Arsene Wenger's team selection on Sunday.\nWith Arsenal holding a 2-0 lead against AC Milan and playing the second leg of their last-16 tie at home on Thursday, Wenger took a risk by making six changes.\nAaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny were rested, with Jack Wilshere only on the bench, but the gamble paid off for Arsenal.\nArsenal give their fans something to cheer about\nThose Arsenal fans who had turned up were almost celebrating after only two minutes when Aubameyang was clean through, but he was denied by a fine save by Orestis Karnezis.\nBut the Gunners took the lead only six minutes later when Mesut Ozil's free-kick from the left touchline was powerfully headed in by Mustafi.\nAubameyang, Ozil and Granit Xhaka were denied by Karnezis, before Aubameyang made it 2-0, collecting Mkhitaryan's pass and taking the ball around the Watford keeper.\nAfter Deeney's penalty miss, Mkhitaryan added a third when he shot past Karnezis following Aubameyang's pass for his first league goal for the Gunners.\nWith the Europa League on Wenger's mind, the Frenchman was able to take Mkhitaryan off late on for Wilshere, although Mustafi is now a doubt for Thursday's match after he limped off in the second half.\nA day to forget for Deeney\nDefeat keeps Watford 10th and nine points clear of the relegation zone. They have 36 points from 30 matches and, on this evidence, should have enough quality in their squad to ensure another season of Premier League football.\nRicharlison shot wide, headed wide and also saw a free-kick pushed away by Cech, with Roberto Pereyra wasting the rebound by shooting over when unmarked six yards out.\nThe Hornets' best chance of the game fell to captain Deeney after Pereyra had been fouled in the penalty area by a combination of Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Alex Iwobi.\nHowever, Deeney, much to the delight of the home fans, had the resulting spot-kick saved by Cech.\nAfter Watford's 2-1 win over Arsenal at Vicarage Road in October, Deeney criticised the Gunners' players and their character.\nAfter that match, he said: \"There's a reason they lost. It's having a bit of cojones. Whenever I play against Arsenal, I'll go up and think 'let me whack the first one and see who wants it'.\n\"They all just backed off. For me as a player, I just think 'happy days'.\"\nBut Deeney, who had scored three times in his past four appearances, had a day to forget on Sunday as his penalty was too close to Cech in the middle of the goal, and the Czech saved it.\nCech ends long wait to reach landmark\nThat penalty save from Cech meant he kept his 200th Premier League clean sheet, but he had to wait a while for it to come as his 199th was back on 16 December in a 1-0 win against Newcastle.\n\"We took 18 games [of this season] to get to nine clean sheets, I got to 199 and then had to wait 11 games to get another clean sheet,\" said Cech.\n\"It was a bit frustrating but we now have eight games left and we have to make sure we win most of them. I believe I got this far through my work ethic.\"\nWenger paid tribute to the 35-year-old and said: \"It has highlighted what Petr Cech has done in his career, 200 clean sheets is remarkable and he has saved a penalty on top of that. It is quite fortunate that it was against Deeney.\n\"His [Cech's] situation shows how football is, in one week he has gone from hell to heaven.\n\"A record like that needs a lot of motivation and a huge level of intelligence because you don't last that long in the game if you're not intelligent.\"\nMan of the match - Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Arsenal)\nLandmarks for Wenger, Cech, Ozil and Arsenal - the stats\nArsene Wenger registered his 700th Arsenal win in his 1,222nd match in charge of the Gunners.\nShkodran Mustafi's opening goal was Arsenal's 1,000th at home in the Premier League, making the Gunners just the second team to reach the landmark after Manchester United (1,066).\nArsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil became the fastest player to reach 50 Premier League assists, doing so in just 141 games and breaking the record held by former Manchester United forward Eric Cantona (143 games).\nPetr Cech made his first Premier League penalty save since February 2011 for Chelsea against Fulham - it was also the 16th he had faced in all competitions for Arsenal and the first one he had saved for the Gunners.\nCech registered his 200th Premier League clean sheet, the first goalkeeper to achieve this feat in the competition's history.\nFour of Mustafi's five Premier League goals have been assisted by Mesut Ozil (two from corners, two from free-kicks) - all four of the Ozil-assisted goals have been at the Emirates.\nWatford have now lost all five of their away Premier League matches in the month of March.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan now has the same record this season in nine appearances for Arsenal in all competitions as he did in 22 games for Manchester United (two goals, five assists).\nMotty's last live commentary\nLegendary BBC commentator John Motson was on duty for BBC Radio 5 live at Emirates Stadium for his last live commentary.\nMotson, 72, made his first live radio broadcast 48 years ago and during his career he covered 10 World Cups, 10 European Championships, 29 FA Cup finals and more than 200 England games.\nListen to the end of Motson's final live BBC commentary\nIn September he announced he would call time on his BBC career at the end of the season, although he will still continue to appear on Match of the Day until May.\nHis first radio commentary was Everton v Derby in December 1969.\n'The spirit kept us out of trouble'\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a difficult game like you get in the Premier League. But overall the spirit and desire was good.\n\"The spirit kept us out of trouble. We dealt well with set-pieces, which is why they could not come back.\n\"At 2-0 they had a penalty and if they had come back to 2-1 it is a fact that we have a bit of fatigue and we could have been in trouble but we took advantage of that miss.\n\"I selected my team to have the chance to win the game and also rest some players I did not want to get injured. We are not so far to the end of the season so, any injuries, you lose them for the rest of the season.\"\nWatford boss Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We had different moments. We started conceding an early goal and then there were different moments with both teams creating chances to score.\n\"We tried to be very concentrated and focused on the match. It was this way, we tried to do as best as possible.\n\"We knew the importance of three points like the importance of the next match. We are only considering this way.\"\nWhat's next?\nArsenal play on Thursday at home to Italian side AC Milan in the second leg of their Europa League last-16 tie, with the London side holding a 2-0 advantage after the first leg. The Gunners do not play in the league again until Sunday, 1 April when they entertain Stoke.\nWatford play in the Premier League next Saturday with a trip to Liverpool (17:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino hailed his side's \"perfect response\" to their Champions League upset after they came from behind at Bournemouth to go third in the Premier League.\nSpurs, who lost Harry Kane to a first-half ankle injury, recovered from their last-16 defeat by Juventus on Wednesday, to win convincingly through Son Heung-min's double and Serge Aurier's late far-post header.\nDele Alli had earlier levelled for the visitors after Junior Stanislas gave Bournemouth a seventh-minute lead.\n\"The answer today was perfect after Wednesday,\" said the Spurs boss. \"I am so pleased - the reaction was important for the team.\n\"They [Bournemouth] played at a high tempo which was difficult. We conceded an early goal but it was a massive three points for us.\n\"There is still a lot of work to do, still a lot of things can happen with eight games to go. Big sides are fighting with us to take a position in the top four.\"\nBournemouth, who remain 12th, thought they had rescued a point via Callum Wilson's 84th-minute strike but referee Mike Dean disallowed it for a shove on Spurs defender Davinson Sanchez, before the visitors scored their two late goals.\nAlli gave Tottenham fans a scare when he was replaced late on, as did left-back Danny Rose, who was making his first top-flight appearance of the year, but both were fatigued rather than injured.\nIt was Pochettino's 150th league win as a manager but a rare recent defeat for his counterpart Eddie Howe, whose side had been beaten just once in their past 10 league fixtures - only Tottenham losing fewer in that period.\nListen to Sunday's BBC Radio 5 live Football Daily podcast\nHistory repeating itself for Kane\nBut for the assistant referee's flag, the 29th minute of the game might have provided the moment that Kane netted his 36th goal, to make 2017-18 his highest scoring season.\nInstead, the England striker picked up an injury that becomes a major concern, and raises an unusual set of parallels.\nThe setback comes only a day short of a year since he last injured his right ankle, during last season's FA Cup quarter-final win over Millwall on 12 March. He was subsequently out for four weeks.\nIt will mean he is likely to miss Spurs' game next Saturday - an FA Cup quarter-final at Swansea.\nIt is the third time the England striker has injured the same ankle, previously damaging it against Sunderland in September 2016.\nPochettino must hope the resilient Kane, who has made 38 appearances in all competitions for Spurs this season, can shake it off quickly.\nSpurs mentally strong\nThe visitors were second-best for large parts of the first half-an-hour, with a confident Bournemouth pressing them hard.\nManager Howe had demanded a fast start from his men and only four minutes had gone when Lys Mousset charged forward and played in Stanislas, who saw his shot come back off the bar.\nThree minutes later, Adam Smith whipped in a precision cross, Sanchez missed a clearing header and Stanislas finished smartly into the bottom corner. It was Bournemouth's first goal against Spurs in seven hours and 36 minutes, a run stretching back to October 2015.\nGiven the hangover from their Champions League defeat, Tottenham could have folded.\nBut they kept going, even after Kane had limped off, and eventually asserted their superiority.\nSon is having a marvellous campaign, which has brought him 18 goals so far, and Kane's absence allowed the South Korean to shine centrally.\nHis intelligent movement and reliability have been a huge plus for the Londoners and so it was again here.\nIf his first was an imperfect finish, volleying the ball into the turf before it spun over Begovic, his second was coolness personified.\nSpurs caught Bournemouth on the break and he sprinted forward, rounded the keeper and slotted in.\nScoreline harsh on Cherries\nSuch a bright start will have given Howe's men genuine hope they could beat Tottenham in the league for the first time.\nThey were first to everything as Spurs slumbered, and Howe's decision to start Mousset, 22, ahead of Joshua King looked a shrewd one as he made several powerful surges.\nBut after deservedly going ahead, and seeing Kane exit, Bournemouth stalled - so much so that they did not have a shot on target for 26 minutes.\nThe Cherries can point to some decisions that might have gone either way - Wilson's shove on Sanchez, which saw his goal ruled out, was minor.\nThe impressive Simon Francis brought a fine save from Hugo Lloris, and Howe said afterwards he was pleased with their efforts overall.\nThey still need two more wins to feel safe from the drop, but if they can replicate this start against rock-bottom West Brom, they can get the ball rolling.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\nBournemouth lack staying power- the stats\nBournemouth have lost 19 points from leading positions this season; only West Brom (21) have dropped more after taking the lead in the Premier League.\nEddie Howe's have failed to beat Tottenham in six Premier League meetings (D1 L5). Only against Manchester City (no points) have they picked up fewer points in the competition since they joined.\nIndeed, the Cherries have conceded 17 goals in six Premier League games against Spurs - only Manchester City have netted more against them in the top flight (21).\nTottenham are unbeaten in their past 12 Premier League games (W9 D3) - only once before have they been on a longer run without a defeat in the competition (14 games, ending in December 2015).\nDele Alli has scored 10 or more goals in all competitions in each of his three seasons with Spurs (42 goals in total).\nAlli has struck in 30 Premier League games and is yet to end on the losing side in those matches (W24 D6 L0), with only three players scoring in more without losing - James Milner (47), Darius Vassell (46) and Salomon Kalou (32).\nSon Heung-min has scored seven goals in his last four games in all competitions, as many as in his previous 22 matches.\nThis was Mauricio Pochettino's 144th Premier League game in charge of Tottenham - no manager has taken charge of more in the competition for the club (level with Harry Redknapp).\nIndeed, this was Pochettino's 150th league win as a manager, 82 of which have come with current club Tottenham (55%).\nSon was fantastic - what they said\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a fantastic performance today from Son Heung-min. Football is about the squad, not only about the 11 players who play. In 10 months of competition, everyone is an important part of the project and fighting for the same objective.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a difficult one for us because we started the game so well. We gave them problems with the pace and physicality of the front two but of course they have quality to hurt you and they did that.\n\"I thought we gave a good account of ourselves for 80 minutes of the match. We worked Tottenham to the limit and had them at their best to beat us.\n\"I can't fault the effort of the players; they left everything on the pitch for us.\n\"We have work to do. We have eight games to go and none of those bigger than next week [at home to West Brom], when we need the crowd behind us.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host West Brom on Saturday 17 March (15:00 GMT), while Spurs travel to Swansea on the same day for their FA Cup quarter-final tie (12:15 GMT)."

We have 81 points, which is a lot! We had a solid performance; we controlled the game and conceded no chances.\n\"David Silva controls the tempo. He has the skills no doubt about that but in the bad moments he is there to control the game and he is an aggressive competitor.\n\"To be champions is tough, it's complicated. Our club does not have a history of a lot of titles. As soon as possible will be better but it doesn't matter where we win it.\n\"I understand that it is important to our fans to win it against United but the target is the next game at Everton. After that, if we play like today sooner or later we will be champions.\"\nStoke manager Paul Lambert: \"They are as good a team as I've seen in a long time. They have gone to another level. But credit to my team, they never capitulated.\n\"Defensively we got caught for the goals but they never carved us up like they have with other teams. This game was never going to define our season. We had odd moments but you have to take your chances.\n\"The way they play is terrific, you don't really see it until you get close up, it's so difficult to stop. I won't criticise my team, we stuck at it.\"\nJesus a lucky charm - the best of the stats\nManchester City have won 81 points from their 30 Premier League games this season - three more than they earned in the entirety of 2016-17.\nThe Blues have now scored 85 Premier League goals this season - only 11 teams have ever scored more in a completed Premier League campaign.\nDavid Silva has scored eight Premier League goals this season, his second highest tally in a single campaign in the competition (12 in 2014-15).\nSilva also bagged his second league double of the campaign - he had only scored three in his previous seven Premier League seasons combined.\nOnly Jonas Lossl (50) has conceded more Premier League goals among goalkeepers than Stoke's Jack Butland (49) this season.\nGabriel Jesus has played 31 Premier League games without ever being on the losing side (W26 D5). It's the fourth longest run without defeat from a Premier League debut, after Jens Lehmann (47), Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba (37 each).\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\nSilva on how his form is so good despite the premature birth of his son: \"I don't know! When I play football I forget about everything else, it is good for me to play.\n\"My private life is very hard for me but my son is fighting and getting better.\"\nWhat's next?\nStoke host Everton next Saturday (15:00 GMT) before enjoying a two-week break. Manchester City's next opponents are also Everton but not until Saturday, 31 March (17:30 GMT) at Goodison Park."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-1 West Bromwich Albion\nAlan Pardew acknowledged that his West Brom side are \"nearing the last-chance saloon\" after a late Junior Stanislas free-kick condemned them to a seventh straight Premier League defeat.\nAlbion are 10 points from a position of safety with seven games to play, as opponents Bournemouth came from a goal down to end their own four-match winless run.\n\"It's tough for my players in particular,\" Pardew said. \"We got in a great position, made a couple of errors and got punished, which has been the story of our season.\n\"Without it being our last chance, it's nearing the last chance saloon. It was a galling way to end the game.\"\nJay Rodriguez looked to have set up Albion for only a fourth league victory of the season when he spun to hook in Salomon Rondon's downward header early in the second half.\nBut Pardew's side lost their concentration amid a defensive reshuffle following the substitution of captain Jonny Evans, falling to a defeat that the head coach called \"heartbreaking\".\nJordon Ibe took advantage as he cut in from the left to bounce a shot past keeper Ben Foster from 25 yards.\nThen Stanislas, who had been off-target with a couple of free-kicks from a similar distance earlier in the match, floated a perfect shot over the wall and inside the post from the edge of the area.\nPardew played down speculation about his own future, saying: \"I get asked every week. When you're losing, it's difficult. I'm contracted here for another three years and I'm going to keep fighting until such time I'm told not to.\"\nBournemouth 2-1 West Brom as it happened\nSaturday's Premier League reaction\nAlbion's discipline falls apart\nFew people seriously believe West Brom will avoid relegation after a dreadful winter, beset by abysmal results on the pitch and embarrassment off it too.\nPardew, appointed to replace the sacked Tony Pulis in November, is widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season, with Leicester assistant manager Michael Appleton reportedly the favoured candidate\n, external\nto take over.\nThe important thing for Albion at present is to restore a bit of pride - and for much of the afternoon, they looked as if they would do that.\nA very disciplined set-up of five defenders and three deep-lying midfielders did much to frustrate the home side's attack; Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson touched the ball only four times in the first half.\nIn addition, they were dangerous on the break, with Rondon seeing two first-half headed chances saved by Asmir Begovic.\nThey looked fairly comfortable until Evans - feeling the effects of the illness that forced him to miss last weekend's home defeat by Leicester - was replaced with a quarter-of-an-hour to play.\nPardew rejigged his defence in the substitution, with Matt Phillips taking over at wing-back. It gave Ibe the chance to equalise within seconds, and Stanislas' free-kick made it an even more painful day.\nEven then, the visitors might have saved a point in the seventh minute of stoppage time. Phillips headed a Kieran Gibbs cross towards goal in a scramble, but Charlie Daniels booted off the line.\nBournemouth nudge towards safety\nA post-Christmas run of seven league matches without defeat - including wins over Arsenal and Chelsea - had gone a long way towards lifting Bournemouth clear of trouble.\nHowever, a sequence of four matches without victory had allowed some unease to creep back in, and that was evident in a laboured display against West Brom.\nEddie Howe's side struggled to create clear chances during the first 75 minutes, and were often left passing the ball sideways around 40 yards from the Albion goal in the vain hope of finding an opening.\nJoshua King had a first-half penalty appeal rejected when he went to ground claiming that Ahmed Hegazi had tugged his shirt, with referee Graham Scott unmoved.\nBefore Ibe's equaliser, it looked as if that winless run would stretch to five matches for a team who, despite 17 efforts on goal, did not trouble Foster anywhere near enough until the closing stages.\nHowe acknowledged that his team did not play well, but they found a way to victory - and with 36 points to their name, they probably only need one more win from their final seven matches to secure a fourth successive Premier League campaign.\nThe Bournemouth manager said: \"I'll take any way to win at this stage of the season. We played very well against Tottenham and Leicester and didn't win either of those games, but we didn't play well today and we won this one.\n\"I want as many points as we can get. We knew West Brom would make it tough. They've got a lot of experienced Premier League players but we had to find a way to win without playing well - it moves us closer to safety.\"\nMan of the match - Jordon Ibe (Bournemouth)\nAlbion's 24-point drop - the key stats\nBournemouth have picked up 16 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nWest Brom have lost 24 points from leading positions in the top flight this season, more than any other team.\nThe Cherries have lost just one of their last seven Premier League games on home soil, winning four and drawing two.\nThat 24-point haul is also the most the Baggies have ever lost from leading positions in a single Premier League campaign.\nJay Rodriguez has netted three goals in his four Premier League appearances against Bournemouth; against no other side has he scored more (having also scored three against Newcastle and Stoke).\nRodriguez's goal was West Brom's first away from home in the league in 402 minutes.\nJordon Ibe has been directly involved in five goals in his last eight top-flight games with Bournemouth (two goals, three assists), after managing just three in his previous 44 with the Cherries (three assists).\nJunior Stanislas has scored four goals in his last seven Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 19.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Bournemouth go to Watford on Saturday, 31 March, the same day that West Brom host Burnley (both 15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 0-2 Crystal Palace\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson hailed a \"vitally important\" victory as his side moved out of the Premier League's relegation zone and dragged opponents Huddersfield deep into trouble.\nWith Southampton in FA Cup action and Stoke losing at home to Everton, Hodgson's side capitalised with a thoroughly deserved victory - their first in eight games - at John Smith's Stadium.\n\"We have had a difficult run of games and not got any points but to get something here at least puts us back in some sort of equilibrium,\" Hodgson said.\n\"I don't think I have ever had a feeling we are on a slide. We are getting players back to fitness and our squad is looking like what it was when we were getting results.\n\"All the points teams get down near the bottom are vitally important.\"\nPalace were on top throughout and opened the scoring in the first half through James Tomkins' close-range effort as Huddersfield failed to deal with Luka Milivojevic's corner, earned by the excellent Wilfried Zaha.\nHaving waved play on a few minutes earlier, referee Mike Dean did award a Palace penalty when Huddersfield defender Martin Jorgensen tripped Andros Townsend and Milivojevic converted from the spot.\nIt took the hosts until nine minutes from time for their first effort on target, a tame strike by Rajiv van La Parra which was easy for Wayne Hennessey to gather.\nPalace moved two places up to 16th, with Town a place further in front but now just three points above the relegation zone.\nRelive Crystal Palace's win over Huddersfield\nPalace turn the tables\nPalace had been winless in their previous seven league games, including losing their last four, and had conceded 15 goals during that period.\nBut having kept only five clean sheets throughout the whole season, this was a welcome shutout and important three points against their fellow relegation candidates.\nTheir performance was built on defender Mamadou Sakho's leadership at the back, displaying what Palace have missed as the Frenchman made just his 12th league appearance of the season.\nBut goalscorer Tomkins also contributed significantly, making 11 clearances - more than any other player on the pitch - while young full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka was unmatched in making six tackles and winning back the ball 12 times.\nZaha the key to survival?\nPalace have played nine games without winger Zaha this season and they have failed to claim a single point in those games.\nHe returned from injury in last week's narrow defeat by Chelsea and made an impressive contribution in this game against the Terriers.\nHis constant pace and trickery, with his darts down the wings stretching the play, caused the Huddersfield backline problems all game.\nIt was the Ivory Coast international's industry which led to the first goal, as he won a corner which Tomkins converted at the second attempt. In all, Zaha made a total of 74 sprints, more than any of his team-mates.\nZaha was taken off late on, but manager Hodgson said it was only a precaution as he had \"taken one or two knocks\" and the only way for Huddersfield \"to stop him was to foul him\".\nHe added: \"He is so good at carrying the ball and we noticed that in the second half for us. He is an outlet for us. He got past people and drew fouls and that put us in their part of the field and gave our defenders a rest.\"\nStriker Christian Benteke, though, also played his part with his hold-up play and by bringing team-mates into the action. On one occasion his lay-off fell for Andros Townsend but the winger struck his shot wide.\nBenteke was also unlucky not to win a penalty for his side when he was dragged to the turf by Jorgensen and when they were awarded a spot-kick, Milivojevic struck his eighth of the campaign.\nGoals win games but Terriers lack bite\nHuddersfield have big problems and are now in a real scrap to preserve their top-flight status, having achieved promotion for the first time last season.\nAlthough they have spent just eight days in the bottom three all season, they look like a side who will do well to stay up on this abject showing.\nDavid Wagner's men have now failed to score in their last four league games and have collected just seven points in 2018 - only bottom side West Brom, who lost to Bournemouth, have fared worse with four.\n\"Credit to Crystal Palace; they deserved this win,\" Wagner said. \"We were below par, particularly with the ball.\n\"There is no doubt about our attitude and effort - we fought - but in ball possession, we were not good enough. We were two steps too late today.\n\"It is important how you manage defeats and a disappointment like today. The good thing is that we know what we have done wrong and what we need to put right.\"\nVisiting goalkeeper Hennessey had a comfortable afternoon in snowy conditions in West Yorkshire, not being called into action until the 81st minute when substitute van La Parra's strike rolled easily into his arms.\nSkipper Jonathan Hogg also had a strike in injury time, but again Wales international Hennessey had no problems dealing with it.\nMili on the spot - the stats\nCrystal Palace have won seven Premier League away points in 2018 (won two, drawn one, lost one), one more than they picked up in their previous 12 away games in 2017.\nHuddersfield have failed to score in a league-high 17 different Premier League games this season.\nThe Terriers have drawn a blank in eight of their last 11 top-flight games.\nCrystal Palace ended a seven-match winless run in the Premier League (drawn two, lost five), securing their first victory since a 1-0 win over Burnley in January.\nLuka Milivojevic has scored more penalties than any other Premier League player this season (six).\nOnly Andy Johnson (11) has scored more penalties in a single Premier League season for Crystal Palace than Milivojevic.\nHuddersfield did not record their first shot of the game until the 63rd minute.\nJames Tomkins scored his first away goal in the Premier League since November 2016 against Swansea.\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield's next game in another huge one as they travel to Newcastle - who have one point more than them - on Saturday, 31 March (kick-off 15:00 BST). Palace host Liverpool on the same day (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 1-2 Everton\nStoke manager Paul Lambert says his side are \"well in the running\" to avoid relegation despite defeat to Everton.\nCenk Tosun scored twice to help the Toffees to their first away win since December with victory over 10-man Stoke.\nThe Potters - whose goal was scored by Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting - have won just one of their last 12 Premier League games.\n\"The games coming up are probably the biggest games the club has faced in many years,\" Lambert said.\n\"It's not against us. We are well in the running. We are going to fight for everything. We will do everything we can to stay in this league.\"\nTosun opened the scoring for the Toffees with his third goal in as many games before Choupo-Moting equalised eight minutes later.\nBut, in a match plagued by snowy blizzards, the Turkey international added his second with seven minutes remaining with a diving header.\nStoke had Charlie Adam sent off in the first half for a lunging tackle on Wayne Rooney.\nThere was confusion when the card was handed out as referee Martin Atkinson incorrectly showed it to Xherdan Shaqiri before realising his mistake and dismissing Adam.\nStoke made five changes to their line-up and started well in snowy conditions. Adam had the first chance to score when he received the ball just outside the area, chesting it down before easing past Tom Davies and unleashing a shot that glided over the bar.\nDavies himself could - and perhaps should - have scored just minutes later for Everton, heading a Wayne Rooney free-kick over Jack Butland's goal.\nHowever, in a first half of sporadic quality, Adam's sending off provided the most dramatic moment - the 32-year-old punished after challenging Rooney with both feet off the ground.\nDespair for Stoke\nIt was another disappointing result for Lambert's men as they extended their run of league games without a win to seven, meaning their decade-long stay in the Premier League looks increasingly perilous with just seven matches remaining.\nCrystal Palace's away win at Huddersfield makes the Potters' survival task ever more difficult too, as the Eagles rose out of the relegation zone and left Stoke four points from safety.\nWith Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool among their opponents next month after the international break, Stoke face a real battle to remain in the top-flight.\nTheir result against Everton doesn't tell the full picture of the 90 minutes, though.\nThey will be frustrated to come away with no points after a performance in which they dominated large spells of the action.\nAdam's dismissal boosted Everton numerically, but Stoke's performance levels were not obviously affected.\nThey were, however, left to rue Peter Crouch's header over the bar under pressure from Phil Jagielka in the first half.\nHad the former England striker converted, Crouch would have become his side's all-time leading Premier League scorer and, potentially, given his side the opportunity to take away something from a game in which they impressed for large parts.\nTosun celebrates brace... and eyes Europe\nTosun's Everton career was slow to get going but with four goals in his last three games, the 26-year-old has finally found his feet in the Premier League following a \u00a327m move in January.\n\"I think I've settled in very well, I feel better,\" he said after the game.\nTosun broke the deadlock with an easy finish from close range, but it was his second, 15 minutes later, which was the more stylish finish, diving low to steer the ball past Butland.\nFollowing the up and down rollercoaster that was Everton's form during the early stages of 2018, things finally look to be heading the right way for Sam Allardyce's side as they recorded their first back-to-back wins since December.\nConfidence will be starting to rise on Merseyside with the Toffees now comfortably in the top half of the table - enough, most would expect, to keep them out of the relegation battle that continues below them.\nNow 12 points above the bottom three, fans will certainly see Tosun's arrival at Goodison Park as having played a large part in their climb to safety, yet he has got even bigger ambitions for the rest of the season.\n\"We want to win as much as possible and we still have the chance to play in Europe next season,\" he said.\n'That's why we bought him' - what the managers said\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce: \"Under the circumstances we are extremely pleased. Considering the elements both teams competed with today they've given everything - even Stoke after they went down to 10 men.\n\"It looked a bit iffy for us again but Cenk popped up with a super goal and that's why we bought him. It's paid dividends for us and it puts us on the 40-point mark, and even though mathematically we are not safe I don't think anyone can catch us now and we can start to prepare for next season.\n\"I think the quality of the finish caught everyone out, including the goalkeeper, but it was very difficult today to put any quality together because of the wind and snow. Wayne Rooney kept us going in midfield and kept us prodding but breaking down 10 men can be difficult.\n\"There weren't that many chances and any chance can come in today's weather - anything could happen, likely a mistake in these conditions and luckily we were the ones that capitalised on that today.\"\nStoke manager Paul Lambert: \"I couldn't ask more for the effort. We had 10 men for most of the game and got ourselves back into it. It's a disappointing result but effort, I couldn't have asked for anymore.\n\"The referee's position is probably a better angle than anyone has [for Charlie Adam's red card] and looking at it now, I can see why he has given it.\n\"The first Everton goal was offside and how he's not seen that I don't know. These are big moments and when you're fighting for your life you need those decisions to go for you.\n\"The weather is part of the game. There's no excuses, that's just the British weather I'm afraid.\"\nMatch stats\nEverton have won just their second Premier League away game of the season, ending a run of five straight defeats on the road.\nThis is the first time Stoke have lost both league meetings against Everton in a single season since their first campaign in the Premier League (2008-09).\nCharlie Adam was the first player to be sent off for a foul on Wayne Rooney in the Premier League since Sam Sodje for Reading in December 2006.\nSince 2008-09, Stoke have had 14 red cards in Premier League home games - only Manchester City (15) have had more in that time.\nPaul Lambert's side are winless in seven Premier League games - only West Brom are on a current longer run (8).\nCenk Tosun has now scored in each of his last three league games for Everton, after failing to score in his first four for the club since joining from Besiktas.\nTosun also became the first Turkish player to score a Premier League brace since Tuncay Sanli for Middlesbrough against Aston Villa in November 2008.\nWhat's next?\nAs the international break gets under way, Allardyce has plenty of time to prepare for Manchester City's visit to Goodison Park in two weeks' time, before the Merseyside Derby kicks off the following week.\nFor Stoke, it's a trip to the capital up next as they take on Arsenal on 1 April, before London travels north for Tottenham's visit six days later."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 5-0 Watford\nMohamed Salah scored four goals as Liverpool moved up to third in the Premier League table by thrashing Watford at Anfield.\nSalah danced through Watford's defence to score early in the game before poking home Andy Robertson's cross late in the first half.\nHe set up Roberto Firmino's clever flick for Liverpool's third, then added two late strikes to complete the rout.\nLiverpool have now opened a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth.\nSalah 'on his way' to earning Messi comparisons - Klopp\nRelive Liverpool's 5-0 victory\nSaturday's Premier League round-up\nThe best of the stats\nJurgen Klopp's side also remain unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season.\nIt was Watford's second successive defeat, and despite chances for Roberto Pereyra and Richarlison, they never looked like getting back into the game.\nBut the Hornets are still eight points above the relegation zone and sit comfortably in 11th position.\nSalah masterclass lights up Anfield\nBefore kick-off, Klopp insisted his side wanted to be back \"immediately on the winning side\" following the disappointment of their 2-1 defeat at rivals Manchester United last Saturday.\nAnd it was a more familiar-looking Liverpool side who turned up at Anfield as Klopp's men put in a performance befitting their manager's urgency.\nThey started the game with high intensity - pressing their opponents and winning the ball back in midfield to set Salah on his way.\nIt did not take long for the Egyptian to make a breakthrough. Within four minutes he had given Liverpool the lead and taken his season's tally to 25 in the league.\nSalah continued to cause Watford's defence problems and it always looked likely he and Liverpool would get a second, overtaking Harry Kane as the league's top scorer in the process.\nRobertson's inch-perfect cross from the left meant the second goal was a tap-in but Salah produced two moments of magic to dance his way to a hat-trick and fire in his fourth.\nTime seemed to stop as he evaded multiple challenges in the area and picked out the corner with a stabbed finish for his third before firing a strike high into the net for his fourth after Danny Ings' shot was saved.\nIt was another masterclass from the Egyptian and his form mirrors Liverpool's as they head into the final stages of the season.\nThe Reds are back up to third place in the table - with rivals Tottenham facing fifth-placed Chelsea in their next match.\nWith seven games left to play, Liverpool look to have consolidated their place in the top four and can also look forward to a Champions League quarter-final with Manchester City.\nHow Salah contributed to all five goals:\n4 mins: Liverpool take the lead as Salah leaves Miguel Britos on the floor after dribbling past him and firing low into the bottom corner.\n43 mins: Salah taps in a cross from the left from Robertson on the stroke of half-time.\n49 mins: Firmino's delicate flick beats Orestis Karnezis at the near post after a cross from Salah.\n77 mins: He pokes the ball past Karnezis to score his hat-trick.\n85 mins: Salah's left-footed strike from the centre of the box finds the roof of the net.\nHis record-breaking stats:\nSalah has scored 36 goals for Liverpool in all competitions - the most by a single player in their debut season for the Reds.\nHe has scored 28 Premier League goals this season - only one African player has managed more in a single campaign (Didier Drogba's 29 in 2009-10).\nSalah is the first Egyptian player to score a Premier League hat-trick, with Egypt the 43rd nation overall and the 10th African country to provide a hat-trick scorer in the competition.\nThe winger scored four goals from his four shots - the first player to do so in the Premier League since Andrey Arshavin in April 2009, also at Anfield.\nA long way off the season opener\nMiguel Britos scored a 93rd-minute equaliser for Watford as Liverpool were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw when these two teams met on the opening day of the season at Vicarage Road.\nLiverpool's defensive frailties - which allowed Watford back into the game in August - were on show against Manchester United last Saturday but there was none of the same at Anfield.\nThe hosts never looked like throwing away the lead and, after scoring twice in the first half, controlled the game comfortably before Salah's late additions to the score.\nSalah's inclusion on the scoresheet comes as no surprise now but when he netted on his debut at Vicarage Road few would have predicted what success he would go on to have this season.\nNor would many who saw that game have predicted a 5-0 rout for Watford in March but aside from two chances from Pereyra and Richarlison, they offered very little going forward at Anfield.\nPereyra's fizzing free-kick hit the crossbar in the second half and could just conceivably have given the Hornets a route back into the game but, in truth, they never looked like matching their hosts.\nThe determination the Hornets showed to come from behind in that opening fixture set the tone for a largely positive campaign which has seen them climb to 11th, eight points above the relegation zone but Saturday's thrashing will be a day to forget.\n'It helps the goal difference' - what the bosses said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It was very pleasing. It could have been really difficult tonight. We knew we had to be spot on from the first to the last second and our work rate had to be higher than 100%.\n\"The goals we scored were unbelievably good, and the boys didn't stop. That's how football should be, so I'm really happy with the performance.\n\"For Mo to be involved in five goals is fantastic but to score four is even more fantastic. His goals are so important for us. We have to hope they all come back well from the internationals.\n\"The clean sheet is very important. They lost a little concentration in the last few minutes but that's normal. It helps us in the goal difference.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"We knew today was going to be a tough game.\n\"We conceded an early goal again like we did against Arsenal and after that it was difficult. We will try to do better next time. They were much better than us and congratulations to them.\n\"Mo Salah is one of the best players at the moment. We know we have played against one of the best teams in Europe.\n\"There are positives we can take, but we will try to do better next time.\"\nNo luck on the road for Hornets - the best of the stats\nThe Reds have averaged 2.2 goals per game since Klopp took over - their highest goals-per-game ratio at Anfield in the Premier League under any manager.\nWatford have lost 10 of their 11 top-flight away games against Liverpool.\nRoberto Firmino (three assists) and Mohamed Salah (four assists) have combined for seven goals in the Premier League this season - the joint-most by any duo, level with Sadio Mane (six assists) and Salah (one assist).\nSadio Mane has had a hand in five goals in three Premier League games against Watford for Liverpool (three goals, two assists).\nWatford are winless in their past nine Premier League away games (D1 L8), scoring just twice in that run and failing to find the net in each of the past five.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday, 31 March (12:30 BST) hoping to consolidate their position in the top four.\nWatford will look to return to winning ways when they host Bournemouth at 15:00 BST on the same day."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool\nCrystal Palace's late defeat by Liverpool felt like \"groundhog day\", according to Eagles manager Roy Hodgson.\nMohamed Salah's 84th minute goal snatched a victory for the Reds and left the hosts two points above the relegation zone.\nPalace suffered the same fate against Manchester United earlier this month when Nemanja Matic scored in injury time to earn his side a 3-2 win.\n\"It's very disappointing for them to get the winning goal so close to the end of the game,\" said former Liverpool boss Hodgson.\nEgypt international Salah took a touch before firing past keeper Wayne Hennessey after Andy Robertson had crossed in from the left.\nLuka Milivojevic had converted from the spot early in the first half to give Palace the lead after Liverpool keeper Loris Karius took out Wilfried Zaha.\nAnd Sadio Mane turned in James Milner's cross shortly after the break to level.\n\"It feels like a groundhog day when we play against the top teams,\" added Hodgson.\n\"In the second half we played well and controlled the ball and created better chances, but we also conceded both goals.\"\nLiverpool had plenty of chances to score in the first half at Selhurst Park as Salah's curling effort tested Hennessey and Mane went close with two headed efforts.\nKarius' early error looked costly as Palace clung on until half-time but Liverpool responded within four minutes of the restart when Milner and Robertson combined down the left to set up Mane.\nChristian Benteke then missed two clear goalscoring chances in as many minutes before Patrick van Aanholt's fizzing free-kick was palmed away by Karius.\nThere were appeals for Mane to be shown a second yellow card - he was booked for diving in the first half - after he picked up the ball on the edge of the area but referee Neil Swarbrick settled for a free-kick.\nThe Reds then completed the comeback when Salah scored his 29th Premier League goal of the season - equalling the league record of scoring in 21 matches in a 38-game season.\nRelive Liverpool's late comeback\nFollow all of Saturday's Premier League games\nListen: BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nSalah saves Liverpool's blushes\nLiverpool headed to Selhurst Park knowing they have an important week ahead.\nThe Reds host Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday before making the short trip to Merseyside rivals Everton in next Saturday's Premier League derby.\nBut Jurgen Klopp named a strong starting line-up in his 100th Premier League game in charge despite expectations he would rest several key players.\nBut Liverpool's first-half performance did not match the boldness of Klopp's selection as they lacked intensity and imagination against a stubborn Palace defence.\nMane's equaliser early in the second half was a good response but Benteke missed two great chances moments later to regain Palace's lead.\nLiverpool had further chances and so did Palace but it was Salah who once again came to the rescue - saving the visitors' blushes.\nVictory takes Liverpool up to second place in the Premier League table - at least for a few hours as Manchester United host Swansea at 15:00 BST.\nMore missed opportunities for Palace\nRoy Hodgson's side suffered yet another defeat against a team in the top six and, having taken an early lead, this was a missed opportunity.\nPalace were the better side in the first half and deserved to be in front after Zaha had won a penalty when he was clattered by Karius.\nThey then defended well - keeping Salah out of action and frustrating Mane.\nEven after Liverpool had responded and equalised, Palace grew in confidence and started to create more in attack.\nBut Benteke missed two golden opportunities to regain the lead and it ultimately proved costly as Salah showed the required prolificacy at the other end.\nFormer Liverpool striker Benteke has missed 20 of the 22 big chances he has had in the Premier League this season, more than any other player.\nPalace have now suffered five defeats in their last six games and are two points above the relegation zone - with their rivals all yet to play.\nAfter throwing away leads against both Manchester United and Liverpool in the space of a month, Salah's late winner will come as yet another blow to the south London side.\nMajor blow for Adam Lallana\nAdam Lallana has started just one game for Liverpool this season after struggling with injury.\nHe came on as a second-half substitute at Selhurst Park in the hope of gaining more match fitness following a 30-minute cameo for England on Tuesday.\nBut it was not what he or Klopp had hoped for when he hobbled off within three minutes of his introduction.\nThe 29-year-old midfielder has played just 215 minutes of Premier League football this season and now looks set to spend more time on the sidelines.\n\"It is not good, he is really down in the dressing room,\" Klopp said. \"It is really difficult, whatever injury it looks like a muscle one.\"\n'Not a Sadio Mane day' - Klopp reacts\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is usual for us that we need to fight here, especially after a difficult start, but it makes it more special at the end. The win was deserved.\nOn Mane's booking for diving: \"For me, it's a penalty, it's clear. He is 0.1 seconds too late going down, but it's a penalty. With contact, how can that be a dive? I spoke to the referee at half-time.\n\"There were a few strange situations today and Mane had to go through 80 minutes of being whistled. It was not a Sadio Mane day today. I thought he would be sent off for handling the ball. I did not understand it but am happy he didn't.\"\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"I thought the referee got the decision right in not giving Mane a penalty. There was a little bit of contact but then a delay and I still think it is cheating and a dive.\"\nWasteful Palace - the best of the stats\nLiverpool have now won 679 top-flight away games - no side has ever won more (level with Arsenal).\nSalah has scored in 21 different Premier League games this season; a joint high for a 38-game season in the competition (Cristiano Ronaldo in 2007-08 and Robin van Persie in 2012-13).\nSalah has been involved in 38 Premier League goals this season (29 goals, nine assists), the most by any player in the competition since Luis Suarez in 2013-14 (43).\nCrystal Palace are the first team to lose three consecutive Premier League home games because of goals conceded in the final 10 minutes (88th vs Tottenham, 90th vs Man Utd and 84th vs Liverpool).\nMane became the joint highest scoring Senegalese player in Premier League history, equalling Demba Ba's haul of 43 in the competition.\nIt was also Mane's fifth Premier League strike against Crystal Palace - more than he has got against any other opponent.\nNo player has won more Premier League penalties this season than Zaha (four), while Luka Milivojevic has taken (eight) and scored (seven) the most spot-kicks this season.\nMan of the match - Andy Robertson\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Bournemouth in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 BST).\nLiverpool host Manchester City in the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Wednesday (19:45 BST) before travelling to Goodison Park for the league's Merseyside derby on Saturday (12:30 BST)."

In other leagues we would be fighting for the title.\n\"We are having a positive season and we still have the FA Cup to come. We are going to fight for our presence there.\"\nCarvalhal still confident of survival\nSwansea have been revitalised since Carlos Carvalhal took over in December, winning five of their opening 10 Premier League matches under the former Sheffield Wednesday manager.\nThe Welsh club were bottom of the league, four points adrift of safety, before Carvalhal's appointment renewed hopes of avoiding the drop.\nHowever, they never looked like boosting their points tally at Old Trafford - a ground where they had fared well in recent seasons with two wins and a draw in their past five visits.\nCarvalhal's side were out-thought and out-run by United in the first half, failing to muster a single shot at goal as the home side controlled the game.\nAfter bringing on striker Tammy Abraham and midfielder Tom Carroll at half-time, they improved considerably in the second half and offered more attacking threat as they searched for what had seemed an unlikely way back into the game.\nEngland striker Abraham twice thought he had halved the deficit with sharp strikes, only to see United keeper De Gea - who had barely been involved up to that point - deny him.\n\"I have good expectations for the future as I think if we will play like that then we will stay in the Premier League,\" said Carvalhal.\nMan of the match - Jesse Lingard (Manchester United)\nMore travel trouble for Swansea - the stats\nRomelu Lukaku is the 28th different player, first Belgian and fifth youngest to score 100 Premier League goals.\nManchester United have won all three meetings with Swansea in all competitions this season, scoring eight goals and conceding none.\nThe Red Devils have won each of their last five Premier League home games, netting exactly twice in each of the last four.\nSwansea have won just one of their last 14 Premier League away games, drawing four and losing nine.\nThe Swans had as many shots on target in this game - two - as they had managed in their three previous Premier League away games.\nAlexis Sanchez had a hand in more Premier League goals in the opening 20 minutes of this match (one goal and one assist) than he had in his previous six appearances (one goal).\nJose Mourinho is unbeaten in all 10 of his previous meetings with Swansea in all competitions, beating five different managers in that time.\nWhat's next?\nFor United, it is the derby.

        "article_text": "Newcastle United 1-0 Huddersfield Town\nAyoze Perez's late goal gave Newcastle a victory that moved them a big step closer towards Premier League safety and left Huddersfield in danger of dropping back into the Championship.\nThe hosts had looked like being frustrated as they missed a number of chances to take the lead early on against the cautious Terriers.\nMatt Ritchie was denied one-on-one by Huddersfield keeper Jonas Lossl before Dwight Gayle saw his lob drop just wide of the post.\nOnly Malaga (20) have failed to score in more games than Huddersfield (18) this season in Europe's top five leagues and they rarely threatened in this encounter.\nBut it looked like they would hold on for an important point until Perez turned home Kenedy's smart cross in the final few minutes to secure a win that lifts Newcastle to 12th in the table and seven points above the relegation zone.\nHuddersfield, meanwhile, remain three points above 18th-placed Southampton, who lost at West Ham, and are now without a win in their last four Premier League games.\nRelive Newcastle's win against Huddersfield\nListen: BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nAlmost time to pop champagne for Newcastle\nNewcastle went into the recent international break on the back of an impressive 3-0 home win against Southampton, a result that gave their fans real hope of their side guaranteeing Premier League football for next season.\nHowever, there was a three-week gap between the Saints game and this one against Huddersfield, a break that some may have feared would disrupt their momentum.\nThat was far from the case.\nThe hosts dominated from kick-off until the final whistle, pinning Huddersfield back in their own half for almost the entire game. Only poor finishing by Gayle and some decent saves by Lossl kept the scores level heading into the final 10 minutes.\nNewcastle had lost only one of their previous six Premier League matches before Huddersfield's visit and the arrival of Kenedy on loan from Chelsea has been a key part in that upturn in form.\nOnce again he played a decisive role in this win, keeping his calm in front of goal to cross for Perez when the temptation could have been to go for glory, a decision that may well have secured another season in the top flight for Newcastle.\nAnalysis - Shelvey should go to World Cup\nFormer Newcastle striker Alan Shearer on Match of the Day: \"The midfield was where the game was won and lost. Jonjo Shelvey and Mohamed Diame bossed the midfield. They work so well as a partnership.\n\"Shelvey was quicker, brighter and sharper than anyone else on the pitch. His passing again was superb. It was a very well deserved and big three points for Newcastle.\"\nFormer England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy: \"In terms of opening up a packed defence, Shelvey is the best England have got. I understand the issues with the other side of his game, discipline and defensive responsibility, but I would be taking him to the World Cup.\"\nToothless Terriers need to find their bite... quickly\nHuddersfield have only spent one week in the bottom three all season but if they do not develop more bite soon they could drop back into it at just the wrong time.\nThey have now failed to find the back of the net in five of their last six games as they once again paid the price for a cautious approach in a game that required more attacking intent.\nThe Terriers finished without a single shot on target as familiar faults were exposed. Their solitary striker, Laurent Depoitre, showed plenty of endeavour but his task was a thankless one as he often found himself isolated in the Newcastle half.\nIn fact, Huddersfield have not scored with any of their last 52 shots in the Premier League since Steve Mounie's goal against West Bromwich Albion in February, having played 394 minutes in the division since then.\nDavid Wagner's side have never played a system that relies on creating lots of chances but it is worrying for the visitors that the fast-paced counter-attacking football and high-pressing game that helped them make the most of their few opportunities is now rarely on show.\nOnly the poor form of those sides below Huddersfield is providing the Terriers with some breathing space but upcoming home games against Watford and Everton are looking increasingly crucial to determining whether they will avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\nMan of the match - Kenedy (Newcastle)\n'We needed to win' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez: \"It was an important game and we needed to win. They are a good team, well organised. We didn't take our chances and in the second half there was a risk we could be caught, but we stayed calm.\n\"Ayoze Perez was doing a good job. He needed to stay calm in that position, move around the position and take his chance.\n\"It was a great atmosphere and the team and fans together are stronger. Forty points is the figure we are looking for and that's it.\"\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"It's a disappointing result for us but it's my job to analyse this in the right way. Our idea was to frustrate them and sit deeper to minimise their clear-cut chances and hurt them on the counter-attack.\n\"In the first half Newcastle had good opportunities but in the second half I thought it was working for us. We had a big opportunity with Scott Malone at the final whistle, we didn't use the chances and this is why we lost the game.\n\"The attitude, fighting spirit and how they followed the game plan was fantastic. I think we were worth a point.\"\nBest since Pards - the stats\nNewcastle are now unbeaten in six straight home league games (won three, drawn three), their best such run in the top flight since December 2014 under Alan Pardew (also six).\nIndeed, the Magpies have won three consecutive games without conceding at St James' Park in the Premier League for the first time since November 2014. They had only kept three clean sheets in their first 13 home league games this season before this run.\nHuddersfield Town have now drawn a blank in 12 separate away games in the Premier League this season, just one short of the single-season record (13) for failing to score on the most occasions on the road in the competition's history, jointly held by Norwich City in 1994-95, Southampton in 1998-99 and Middlesbrough in 2002-03.\nAyoze Perez has scored his first Premier League goal at St James' Park since 5 March 2016 against Bournemouth, 756 days ago.\nKenedy has been directly involved in four goals in his first four home league games for Newcastle United (two goals, two assists).\nMartin Dubravka has kept three clean sheets in his first five Premier League games for Newcastle. No other goalkeeper has more for the club in the top flight this season (Rob Elliot three from 16 appearances, Karl Darlow two from 10).\nWhat next?\nNewcastle head to Leicester on Saturday, 7 April (15:00 BST), while Huddersfield are at Brighton at the same time."

Coming back from injury he has looked sharp. I expected him to come on and make a difference and it was a fantastic finish.\"\nKiko Femenia had given Watford the lead on 13 minutes, volleying in Jose Holebas's cross from just inside the box.\nHolebas then gifted the Cherries a penalty just before half-time as he pushed the ball away with his hand to stop Jordon Ibe getting to a rebound, after Orestis Karnezis had saved Junior Stanislas' shot.\nJoshua King sent Karnezis the wrong way to roll his penalty in.\nBut the Hornets restored their lead four minutes after the break, Roberto Pereyra's low shot trickling past Asmir Begovic.\nBournemouth, who hit the bar through Nathan Ake's header in the fourth minute, failed to create many chances in the second half, with Defoe going closest with a header in the 77th minute, seven minutes after coming on.\nWatford looked set for three points that would have gone a long way to ensuring their Premier League safety, until Defoe's goal.\nBoth teams move to 37 points, nine points clear of the the relegation zone, with Bournemouth staying in 10th and Watford a place behind.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive Bournemouth dramatic draw\nListen: BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\n'Watford lost two points'\nOn average, the number of points to guarantee staying up in the previous 22 seasons is 36.6, so Watford can at least take consolation in having passed that mark.\nFollowing successive league defeats by Arsenal and Liverpool, conceding eight goals, this was an improvement.\nDefoe's equaliser prevented Watford from recording four straight home wins in the top flight for the first time since December 1986 under Graham Taylor.\nBut they are still unbeaten at Vicarage Road since a 2-1 defeat by Swansea on 30 December.\nThe defence will be of concern to Javi Gracia.

We have to understand that we are in a situation of our own making.\"\nAnalysis\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone at London Stadium:\nIt is far too simplistic to say all West Ham's problems at London Stadium could be solved by a few wins.\nOver a four-hour period before kick-off, I saw a lot of fans - male and female, young and old - vent their frustrations at a variety of issues about the club, from improving the feel of the stadium to getting rid of the owners completely.\nBut there is no doubt either, what was always going to be a tough transition from the earthy and nostalgic Upton Park to the white, almost corporate London Stadium, from West Ham's traditional home to one they don't actually own, would have been a lot smoother had their form been better here.\nThree-nil is not a massive score. But it is the joint record West Ham have achieved in almost two seasons at the stadium. Brighton and Burnley between them have done the same here this season alone.\nOnce again, the first half proved a winning team can generate an atmosphere too.\nToday's result will generate some momentum. For West Ham's sake, they must keep it going.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic\nHart's long wait - the best stats\nWest Ham United scored three first-half goals in a Premier League game for the first time since September 2012 against Fulham.\nIndeed, the Hammers have scored three goals in a Premier League game at London Stadium for just the second time - also 3-0 against Crystal Palace in January 2017.\nSouthampton have won just 28 points from their 31 Premier League games this season - only in 1996-97 and 2004-05 (27 each) have they recorded fewer at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\nMark Hughes hasn't won his first Premier League match in charge of a club since September 2004 at Blackburn - losing four of his five such games since then (lost with Man City, QPR, Stoke and Southampton, and drew with Fulham).\nHughes has won just one of his last 12 away Premier League games as manager (W1 D3 L8).\nJoao Mario netted his first-ever Premier League goal in what was his sixth appearance in the competition.\nJoe Hart kept his first Premier League clean sheet since September (versus Swansea), ending an eight-game wait for a shutout.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Chelsea in their next game on Sunday, 8 April (16:30 BST kick-off) while Southampton face Arsenal earlier the same day (14:15 BST)."

It was certainly not a game that we deserved to lose,\" said Hughton.\nThe win keeps Leicester in eighth, while Brighton drop one place to 13th in the table.\nFoxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel saved Murray's penalty in the 77th minute, with Vicente Iborra's header putting Leicester into the lead shortly afterwards.\nNdidi's foul on Shane Duffy earned the midfielder his second yellow card, but Leicester hung on with Jamie Vardy adding Leicester's second deep into injury time.\n\"The next bit is that we've got to score goals ourselves,\" Hughton added. \"We created good opportunities and had decent chances to score.\n\"They got a lift in the last period of the game, following the penalty miss, and that got them the goal.\"\nA quiet game had finally come alive when Ndidi fouled Jose Izquierdo in the Leicester area, but Murray's tame effort from the spot was parried away by Schmeichel, low to his left.\nRelive all of Saturday's Premier League action\nCatch up again with how the match unfolded\nListen: BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nIborra rose to Ben Chilwell's cross from the left to place the ball beyond Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan and, after Ndidi's dismissal, Brighton defender Gaetan Bong missed at close range from a corner.\nVardy converted Demarai Gray's cross to ensure Leicester sealed their second consecutive away win in the Premier League.\nNightmare for Murray\nThis will be a game that Glenn Murray will want to forget about very quickly.\nThe Cumbrian striker's 11 league goals make him Brighton's leading scorer this season and it was a surprise to see him miss the target completely when one-on-one with Schmeichel shortly before half-time.\nHis spot kick lacked conviction and it proved to be the game's turning point, with the visitors making the most of the opportunity to snatch all three points.\nBrighton are still six points above the relegation zone, and they now face fellow strugglers Huddersfield and Crystal Palace in their next two outings.\nMurray will be hoping that a rare bad day at the office does not have more serious ramifications by the end of the season, when their last two games are at home to Manchester United and then away at Liverpool.\nGutsy Leicester hang on\nWith Leicester barely registering in attack, Schmeichel's contribution between the posts proved to be pivotal, both at the penalty and at a couple of other moments.\nHe pushed away a long-range shot from Pascal Gross early in the second half, and kept out Solly March just after Iborra had nodded the Foxes ahead.\nNdidi's clumsy contribution did not help Leicester's cause, but the steely resolve instilled by Claude Puel since he took over as manager in October helped the 2015-16 Premier League winners grind out the result.\nFew would have predicted that Puel's side would be, just about, in the mix for a place in the Europa League at the end of the season when he replaced Craig Shakespeare.\nBut gritty displays like this, coupled with the excellent form of Vardy, mean that finishing sixth or seventh is not out of the question.\nMan of the match - Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester City)\nWhat the managers said\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton: \"We are hugely disappointed and it was a game we didn't deserve to lose. I thought the things we needed to do to nullify their strengths we did very well, but the next bit is scoring goals ourselves.\nAsked whether the penalty miss changed the balance of the game, Hughton said: \"They are the moments in a game we want to go our way but it doesn't and that gives them the advantage.\n\"It happens and Glenn [Murray] has scored penalties and vital goals for us this season. Leicester will be grateful for a good save and we are disappointed we missed it.\"\nLeicester manager Claude Puel:\n\"I don't know if the result is fair but we take the three points and it's an important cushion for us.\n\"Brighton played well and they had quality so it was difficult for us in the first half after the international break. In the second half it was better and the penalty save from Kasper [Schmeichel] changed the situation. It gave us the belief to score both goals.\nAsked whether Wilfred Ndidi's sending off was fair, Puel said: \"I don't understand why he was sent off because when I watched the reply it wasn't a foul. He touched the ball and it changed direction.\n\"I hope it can be watched by the commissioner again because he is a crucial player for us.\"\nSchmeichel equal with his dad - the stats you may have missed\nKasper Schmeichel has saved three of the 14 Premier League penalties he's faced - the same number his father Peter saved during his time in the competition (21 faced).\nThis was Brighton's fourth Premier League home defeat, and first against a non 'big-six' side.\nWilfred Ndidi's red card was Leicester's fourth of the season in the Premier League - no side has been shown more (level with Chelsea and Watford).\nThis was the 23rd away Premier League game in which Leicester had a player sent off, but only the second they went on to win (also beating Hull in December 2014).\nJamie Vardy has scored in five of Leicester's last six away league games, with the other game in that run ending 0-0.\nVicente Iborra has scored in back-to-back Premier League games, after netting in just one of his first 14 in the competition.\nOf Iborra's goals in the big five European leagues, 38% have been headers (12/32).\nWhat's next?\nBrighton face a side three points and three places behind them when they take on Huddersfield Town on Saturday, 7 April at 15:00 BST. Leicester are also in action on 7 April, playing Newcastle at the King Power Stadium at 15:00 BST."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Burnley\nWest Brom manager Alan Pardew says some of his players \"can't deal\" with their relegation battle after Burnley condemned them to a Premier League record eighth successive defeat.\nAshley Barnes' spectacular volley and Chris Wood's second-half goal kept Burnley's European hopes alive, while a late Salomon Rondon strike could not prevent the hosts losing again.\nThe Baggies remain seven points adrift at the bottom of the table and Pardew demanded more confidence from his players.\n\"You learn that certain players can deal with the situation, others not,\" he said. \"We have another tough match next week, we have to be confident enough to stand up to the opposition and ask them questions.\n\"It was a difficult afternoon against a good side. Second half was a lot better, I tried to change the shape and it worked better.\n\"We were unlucky - after having a chance at 2-1 - not to get something out of the game in the end.\n\"We were so tentative in trying to close the ball down; that was not the team I see in training.\n\"We didn't cope with the pressure well, but we got better in the second half. We need to get a result somehow, and did everything today.\"\nBurnley striker Wood could have scored twice after Barnes' first-half opener and Sean Dyche's men were denied a strong penalty claim when Ahmed Hegazi tugged on James Tarkowski's shirt in the area.\nBut New Zealand international Wood, who started his career in England at The Hawthorns, scored from close range after the break to settle their nerves.\nRondon struck late on to give the Baggies brief hope but the Clarets held firm to push West Brom ever closer to the drop.\nThe Hawthorns was already emptying in added time, although Albion kept pressing for an equaliser in the extra five minutes.\nBurnley are now only two points behind seventh-placed Arsenal, who face strugglers Stoke at the Emirates on Sunday lunchtime.\nListen: BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nBurnley's season of firsts\nIt was a first win at The Hawthorns since 1969 in a season of memorable firsts for Sean Dyche's impressive Burnley side.\nPreviously, the Clarets had been winless in all five of their Premier League matches against West Brom, and hadn't beaten the Baggies on their own turf since before 46-year-old Dyche was born.\nBut they arrived looking to reduce the gap on Arsenal and build on their dramatic win over West Ham, after already amassing their record points total in the top flight.\nThis latest triumph - which was nervier than it should have been because Wood failed to convert either of his two good first-half chances - keeps them on track for another impressive first: Europa League football.\nBurnley fans are starting to believe in the possibility of matches against Continental sides, knowing the seventh-placed team in the Premier League could enter the Europa League this season, providing the FA Cup is won by a team in the top six. And, as it stands, three of the four semi-finalists currently occupy top-six spots.\nBurnley, though, are likely to be pushed hard by Leicester, who are only three points behind the Clarets with seven games remaining. The two teams meet in a potentially-decisive fixture at Turf Moor on 14 April.\nWith strikers bang in form - both Barnes and Wood are on scoring runs - and goalkeeper Nick Pope making key saves like the one that denied Rondon's header before half-time, Burnley are showing few signs of slowing.\nAnd in this campaign of new heights, few would bet against European qualification.\nBaggies offer a glimpse of their battling qualities\nCaptain Jonny Evans said some West Brom players cried in the dressing room after their previous Premier League defeat at Bournemouth.\nThey tasted defeat again on Saturday, but could at least take heart from a spirited performance in which they never gave up, even after being booed off as they trailed at half-time.\nThe table does not look any prettier, though, and some fans voted with their feet. The attendance of 23,455 was below this season's Hawthorn's average of 24,728.\nAgainst Burnley, West Brom were behind the visitors in a number of key areas - coming out second best in the possession, shots and passes count.\nAt times - like when Evans gifted the ball to Burnley's Georges-Kevin Nkoudou in the first half and the Burnley winger might have capitalised - their vulnerability is palpable.\nAnd it seems that, on occasion, West Brom's players are scared to take risks on the ball, lack creativity - second-half sub Matt Phillips made the most key passes (two) - and every error seemingly leads to groans from the home supporters.\nBut they must keep fighting to ensure their likely relegation does not make the season's finale more toxic than it has to be.\nRondon's late goal, and the way they stayed positive after such a poor first half, did at least offer an example that their fighting spirit remains.\nAnd it is that which they will need to tap into as supporters begin to resign themselves to a first season in the Championship since 2009-10.\nChris Wood's influence telling - the stats\nBurnley have won six away games this season, one more than in their three previous Premier League campaigns combined (5).\nChris Wood has found the back of the net in each of his last three Premier League games, scoring four in the process.\nWood has had a hand in more Premier League goals this season than any other Burnley player (8 goals, 1 assist).\nWest Brom have lost eight consecutive Premier League games, their longest losing run in the competition. It's their longest losing run in the top flight since a nine-game streak ending in September 1985.\nAlan Pardew has collected just 12 points from a possible 84 in his last 28 Premier League games as manager of both Crystal Palace and West Brom (W2, D6, L20).\nAshley Barnes is the second Burnley player to score in four consecutive Premier League appearances after Sam Vokes did so between May and August 2017.\nAaron Lennon has assisted a team-mate in back-to-back Premier League games having registered just one assist in his previous 72 in the competition.\nSalomon Rondon has scored three and assisted one more in four Premier League matches against Burnley.\n'We're a work in progress' - what they said\nBurnley manager Dyche warned that the club should not get carried away by the prospect of Europa League qualification.\n\"You have to be careful what you wish for, we're a work in progress,\" he said. \"To be the real deal, you've got to keep working, but I am proud of my players' achievements.\n\"We scored a really good opening goal. We had more possession than you would expect for an away side, we were effective with it, and opened it up with a fine goal. It is a strange place to come being how tough a time they're having, but I thought we handled that well.\"\nMan of the match - Ashley Westwood (Burnley)\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom host Swansea City at The Hawthorns on Saturday 7 April (15:00 BST), while Burnley travel to Watford at the same time."

The Brazilian finished with 14.5% possession himself while the whole Everton team managed 17.9%.\nSane also impressed in scoring his ninth league goal of the season and playing a key role in Jesus' goal.\nFormer Premier League striker Alan Shearer described the German's performance as \"incredible\" on Match of the Day.\n\"How he stretches teams, it makes the pitch so big and is so difficult to defend against,\" Shearer added.\nCity, with Silva the superb orchestrator, operated on cruise control throughout - barely breaking sweat to close in on the Premier League and, significantly, not taking too much out of themselves ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Liverpool at Anfield.\nOn so many levels, this was the perfect warm-up for that game and the derby against United next Saturday night that could see City win the Premier League in the sweetest of circumstances.\nDavid Silva's immaculate service\nKevin de Bruyne has rightly claimed huge plaudits for his contribution to Manchester City's runaway title success - but he has been ably assisted by Guardiola's little magician Silva.\nThe 32-year-old Spain international simply gets better with every passing Premier League season; the \u00a324m City paid to Valencia in July 2010 now looking one of the great bargains.\nSilva pulled all the strings here at Goodison Park, from the moment he showed sublime technique and vision to control a pass before sending a perfect cross to the far post for Sane to volley City in front.\nAll City's big players played their part but Silva was at the heart of it, having the time and space all world-class performers can make for themselves. He not only ensures he has several options every time he receives possession, he has the happy knack of then choosing the right one.\nManchester City's procession to the title has had many key contributors - and Silva is right up there with them.\nWhat now for Everton and Allardyce?\nEverton manager Allardyce was in confident mood before this game, pointing to an improved record since he arrived and a belief the club's supporters are behind him.\nHe is certainly right on point one but this footballing relationship carries all the appearances of a loveless marriage between Allardyce and a fanbase who accepted what was an emergency appointment on an 18-month deal at the end of November, five weeks after Ronald Koeman's sacking.\nAllardyce, as he does, has guided Everton to a position of almost certain safety and this joyless season at Goodison Park certainly cannot solely be placed at his door given previous struggles under Koeman and then caretaker David Unsworth.\nThe atmosphere at Goodison Park, however, was flat throughout and while City's excellence and superiority was accepted, Everton's fans were restless because of the lack of urgency and aggression that allowed Guardiola's side the run of the game.\nAnd Allardyce's approach of sending so many long balls towards the tireless Cenk Tosun looked dated when set alongside City's passing brilliance. The Turkish striker was given sympathetic applause when he was substituted late on.\nAllardyce has not won the hearts of Everton's support and there are further reports of another summer of change at Goodison Park this summer with PSV Eindhoven sporting direction Marcel Brands and Shakhtar Donetsk coach Paulo Fonseca touted as potential replacements for director of football Steve Walsh and Allardyce himself.\nWhether that is a direction Everton owner Farhad Moshiri wishes to take remains to be seen, but the ambitious billionaire certainly has some big decisions to make.\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\n'You have to be aggressive here'\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola said: \"It's so good, we are so happy. After three weeks without a game, you never know how you will react.\n\"We started the first half so good. In the second half they got the goal and had five minutes more, but after that we controlled the game. It's the first time we've been able to win at Everton, together, and one more game we can be champions.\n\"You have to be aggressive and keep the ball. At Goodison Park and Anfield, if you don't win duels, if you don't show up, it's almost impossible to take a result. It's not just today. It's two years thinking and talking and training that way.\"\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce said: \"Manchester City are a top quality team, you have to admire a team that especially in the first half were too good for you. As much as the lads tried it was something we couldn't cope with.\n\"The real turning point was when we should've scored with Bolasie, gone 1-1, and then they scored. It was very difficult when they scored, I thought Silva was offside for one of the goals but what can you do.\n\"We fought, battled, scored and tried to go until the very end. All their 11 are fantastic in that system and that's why they are so far ahead.\"\nCan we have our ball back please? - the stats\nCity's final possession figure of 82.13% is the highest by an away side in a single Premier League game since such data became available (2003-04).\nPep Guardiola is now the second quickest manager to reach 50 Premier League wins in the competition's history, doing so in just 69 matches. Only Jose Mourinho (63 games) reached 50 wins faster.\nCity are the 10th team to have beaten every other top flight club within the same season, and the first since Manchester United in 2010-11.\nThis was the first time that Everton conceded 3+ goals in the first half of a Premier League game at Goodison Park since August 2009 against Arsenal.\nManchester City are just the third club to have three players (Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sane and David Silva) reach double figures for assists in a single Premier League season, after Liverpool (1995-96) and Arsenal (2004-05).\nNo Everton player has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions this season than Dominic Calvert-Lewin (eight goals, six assists), level with Wayne Rooney.\nWhat's next?\nCity visit Liverpool in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, 4 April (19:45 BST), before both the Merseyside and Manchester derby are played next weekend.\nEverton host third-placed Liverpool on Saturday, 7 April (12:30 BST), while City will clinch the title if they win at home to United (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-0 Stoke City\nArsene Wenger feels Arsenal's failure to mount a title challenge was the main reason for another sparse crowd as three late goals saw them beat relegation-threatened Stoke.\nThe Gunners were booed off at half-time at Emirates Stadium after seeing Aaron Ramsey clip the crossbar with their only clear chance of the first 45 minutes.\nBut Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty broke the deadlock after a disputed foul by Bruno Martins Indi on Mesut Ozil, before the Gabon striker fired home from an Ozil corner.\nAubameyang then passed up the chance to claim a hat-trick after Badou Ndiaye's push on substitute Alexandre Lacazette, who converted the penalty for a scoreline that flattered the Gunners.\nArsenal, who host CSKA Moscow in the Europa League next, remain 13 points outside the Premier League's top four after Tottenham later won at Chelsea so Wenger understands why there were scores of empty seats.\n\"It's just down to the fact that we're not fighting for the championship,\" he said. \"People know that will not change now. They will be back on Thursday, don't worry.\n\"It's explainable by the fact that it's Easter. It's a family happening where people go away and it's a fact that we don't think about a lot in the Premier League. There's also the fact that we had a break.\"\nDespite having 17 days between matches - a result of the international break and being out of the FA Cup - Arsenal looked laboured in possession before showing greater urgency after the break.\nStoke did hit the woodwork through Xherdan Shaqiri's second-half corner but the hosts were in the ascendancy when the first penalty was awarded. However, replays showed that Martins Indi appeared to get his left foot to the ball before catching Ozil from behind.\nNdiaye then fired narrowly wide for Stoke before Arsenal condemned the Potters to their eighth game without a win, keeping them second from bottom and three points from safety.\nCould the Europa League save Arsenal's season?\nPetr Cech and Granit Xhaka's ever-present league records came to an end while Laurent Koscielny was left on the bench, with Wenger perhaps trying to keep them fresh for Thursday's quarter-final first leg.\nArsenal's European campaign has taken on huge significance for Wenger and the club, at a time when many supporters have been calling for change while disillusioned fans continue to stay away.\nArsenal look certain to miss out on a top-four finish, so it seems their only way of qualifying for next season's Champions League is to win the Europa League. Wenger may also need to win it to convince the Arsenal board to keep him in charge.\nThe team he fielded against Stoke played like a side with their eyes on a bigger prize. They were sloppy and sluggish early on, and it was not until the 23rd minute that they got behind the Stoke defence for the first time.\nHector Bellerin's low cross was deflected into the path of Ramsey, whose deft volley went behind off the bar. Ramsey and Mohamed Elneny then saw shots deflected wide.\nDanny Welbeck fired wide as Arsenal improved in the second half. Elneny's shot was then blocked, with Nacho Monreal's follow-up saved by Jack Butland, but the Gunners breathed a sigh of relief as Shaqiri's inswinging corner came back off the far post with David Ospina beaten.\nThe ruthless nature in which the home side finished the game will encourage Wenger before the European clash, though. Butland had to deny Aubameyang and Calum Chambers before their late goal burst.\nJack Wilshere's presence, after being forced to withdraw from international duty, was a positive for both Wenger and England manager Gareth Southgate before the World Cup.\n'The ref needs to watch it again' - Stoke's penalty rage\nStoke had frustrated Arsenal for long periods before the penalty was given and the visitors had complaints about the decision.\nManager Paul Lambert said: \"I thought we were excellent and looked really good but Arsenal got the penalty. It was a game changer.\n\"I saw Craig Pawson after the game. I respect the referee but he has not got the benefit of television. He explained they only have one major angle to have a look at it.\n\"Do I have sympathy with the referee? I don't know. It was harsh on us because I thought we were great. I've been here a few times and won, but we haven't played as well as that.\nDefender Bruno Martins Indi said: \"It was not a challenge. I touched the ball and it was not a penalty. The referee had a different view or something and gave it.\n\"I could not believe it. It cost us because we played very well. It killed the moment. I've seen it back; I think the referee's angle was not good enough.\n\"He said that I stretched my leg and I made a foul. He needs to watch it again.\n\"Mesut Ozil is of course going to say it's a penalty - if I was in his position I would say the same. It was no penalty and the cameras don't lie.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: \"I will have to look at it again. I don't know. From outside it looked like it was a penalty.\"\nTime running out for Stoke\nThe Potters have won just one of their 10 games under Paul Lambert, who has been trying to stamp his authority on the squad he inherited from Mark Hughes.\nErik Pieters returned after being left out of the defeat by Everton for breaking a curfew while this week Ibrahim Afellay was told to stay away from the club.\nLambert said Stoke would try to win at Arsenal and they certainly started with that intent. Rather than leaving Mame Biram Diouf as a lone striker, Shaqiri and Ramadan Sobhi were up in support.\nShaqiri curled an early effort just wide of the top corner and, partly due to Stoke's urgency, Arsenal frequently gave the ball away in dangerous positions.\nBut they failed to create any more clear-cut chances in the first half and, before Shaqiri's corner almost caught out Ospina, the best they mustered in the second was a tame curling effort by the Switzerland forward which was straight at the home keeper.\nLambert's no-nonsense stance looks as if it will have long-term benefits, and he had no complaints about the effort of his players. But Stoke need immediate results and, in the short term, they seem to be over-reliant upon Shaqiri.\nThe suspended Charlie Adam said before the game that three wins from their final seven games would be enough to clinch survival.\nThey now have just six left but, as Adam said, they still have to play West Ham, Crystal Palace and Swansea. This result makes those games even more important.\nMan of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal)\nWenger's big change - key stats\nArsenal have won their past 16 home matches against Stoke in all competitions, a run stretching back to August 1981.\nArsenal made seven changes to the team that started their last league game, more than they had made in any Premier League match since 1 January 2011 (8 v Birmingham).\nStoke are winless in their past 18 Premier League matches in London (W0 D6 L12), since winning 2-1 at Tottenham in November 2014.\nStoke are without a win in 11 away Premier League games (D4 L7), with no side enjoying fewer top-flight away victories this season (1, level with West Brom).\nArsenal have scored three or more goals and kept a clean sheet in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2015.\nThe Gunners have scored two penalties in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2012 (v West Brom).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host CSKA Moscow in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday, 5 April (20:05 BST). The Gunners return to Premier League action at home to Southampton on Sunday, 8 April (14:15 BST), while Stoke host Tottenham on Saturday, 7 April (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-3 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino praised \"fighter\" Dele Alli for coming through a \"tough period\" to score two goals as Spurs won at Chelsea for the first time in 28 years.\nAfter Alvaro Morata headed in Victor Moses' cross to give the hosts the lead, Christian Eriksen hit a stunning equaliser on the stroke of half-time as his dipping effort from 25 yards dropped just under the bar and over a stranded Willy Caballero.\nAlli then took centre stage in the second half, putting Tottenham ahead just after the hour mark when he produced a sublime first touch to bring Eric Dier's ball under control before slotting beyond Caballero.\nThe England midfielder was well-placed four minutes later to stab in following a goalmouth scramble and wrap up a win that moves fourth-placed Tottenham eight points clear of Chelsea, who are fifth.\nIt was also the perfect response by Alli after a disappointing couple of weeks with England on international duty.\nHe failed to make an impact in a 22-minute substitute appearance in the 1-0 win against the Netherlands and was then left on the bench for the 1-1 draw with Italy.\n\"I'm very, very pleased,\" said Pochettino. \"It's been a tough period for him, but for no doubt about his talent, his character. He's a fighter; very competitive.\n\"If he doesn't play for the international team he needs to fight and win trust and confidence again.\n\"In the end, he's a great talent, only 21 years old, and sometimes we lose the focus on that.\n\"Sometimes the expectation is too much. There is too much pressure.\"\nTop four taking shape as Chelsea's troubled 2018 continues\nChelsea full-back Marcos Alonso described this London derby as a 'must-win game' beforehand and it was hard to disagree, given the consequences for Champions League qualification.\nAntonio Conte's side had won just three of their nine league games in 2018 prior to Tottenham's visit but they did have history in their favour.\nSpurs had a torrid record at Stamford Bridge in the league, losing 18 of their 27 games since a late Gary Lineker header secured a 2-1 win in February 1990.\nIt looked as if their miserable run would continue as, despite dominating possession, they fell behind after an excellent ball by Antonio Rudiger found Moses wide right and the wing-back delivered a perfect cross for Morata to score his seventh headed goal of the season.\nThe balance of play then swung in Chelsea's favour as they went on the hunt for a second and Hugo Lloris did well to push away a strong Alonso strike.\nBut Tottenham are a team with momentum. They had not lost in the Premier League since 16 December, winning all four of their previous fixtures, and Eriksen, so often capable of creating something from nothing, delivered a sucker punch with his excellent dipping strike.\nFrom then on, the visitors were in control and Alli's quick-fire not only put paid to Chelsea's chances of getting a result but possibly their top-four hopes as well.\nThey will now need to take at least nine points from the 21 available just to overhaul Tottenham's current total. Given that they have taken just six points from their previous seven games, it would seem a tall task.\n\"We have to try until the end to catch the teams in the Champions League places and in this case it is Tottenham and Liverpool,\" Chelsea boss Conte said.\n\"We have to try.\"\nKane return a boost for Spurs and England\nThe sight of Harry Kane grimacing in pain while clutching his ankle at Bournemouth on 11 March will have been a devastating one for both Tottenham and England fans.\nThe striker has been in scintillating form this season with an incredible 39 goals in just 43 games in all competitions, so the prospect of him being out for a lengthy spell had threatened to upset Tottenham's top-four hopes and England's World Cup preparations.\nHowever, having avoided any significant damage to his ankle, he has made a recovery quicker than anticipated and was fit enough to be on the Tottenham bench at Chelsea. He was introduced with 16 minutes remaining, as Alli's two goals allowed him to be eased back into action.\nWith Tottenham just four points behind second-placed Manchester United and an FA Cup semi-final against Jose Mourinho's men on the horizon, Spurs would appear to have their form - and their key players back - at just the right time.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli\nConte getting the most from his squad? What they said\nChelsea boss Conte, asked if he had achieved the maximum possible return with Chelsea's current squad this term, said: \"Yeah, I'm sure, because we are working, we are working very well, we are working very hard and the commitment of the players is top.\nTottenham boss Pochettino said: \"It's a fantastic weekend for us, a massive three points, and we are in the best way to achieve the top four at end of the season. That is our challenge.\n\"We are so happy for our fans after 28 years to win again at Stamford Bridge.\"\nMore derby delight for Tottenham - the stats\nTottenham ended a run of 27 league visits to Chelsea without a victory (D9 L18), winning there for the first time since February 1990.\nChelsea scored the first goal in a Premier League home game and went on to lose for the first time since 1 April 2017 against Crystal Palace (1-2).\nTottenham have won more points in Premier League London derbies this season than any other side (16 - W5 D1 L2).\nSeven of Alvaro Morata's 11 Premier League goals this season have been headers, more than any other player has managed.\nMorata's seven headed goal haul is also the most ever by a Chelsea player in a Premier League season.\nChelsea have scored a league-high 14 headed goals this season.\nChristian Eriksen has scored 16 goals from outside the box since his Premier League debut in September 2013; the most of any current player in that time in the competition.\nEriksen has been directly involved in five goals in his last five Premier League appearances against Chelsea, scoring two and assisting three.\nDele Alli marked his 100th Premier League game by scoring two in a top-flight game for the first time since January 2017 (also against Chelsea).\nWhat next?\nChelsea host West Ham on Sunday, 8 April (16:30 BST), the day after Tottenham travel to Stoke (15:00 BST)"

Everton were always ready to fight but we didn't give them the opportunity until the late stages. We stopped playing football and were a bit lucky. But that is what we have to take. I think it's an absolutely deserved draw.\n\"For 75 minutes we were completely in charge. I am absolutely OK, it's not the best day in my life, but let's carry on. Now we have to focus immediately and be ready again on Tuesday, let's fight for the next round.\"\nStats - Liverpool's derby dominance\nThis was only the second Merseyside derby in Premier League history without a single card shown and first since their opening match in the competition in December 1992.\nFive of the past six Premier League meetings between these sides at Goodison Park have ended level.\nEverton have scored just four goals in their past nine top-flight Merseyside derbies, failing to score in five of those games.\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 17 games in all competitions against Everton (W8 D9) - their longest run without defeat against their Merseyside neighbours.\nOnly Manchester City (41) have won more points on the road this season in the Premier League than Liverpool (31).\nAllardyce has won just five of his 28 Premier League games against Liverpool as a manager (D8 L15).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool's next game is their biggest of the season so far. They travel to Etihad Stadium on Tuesday (19:45 BST) to face Manchester City for their Champions League quarter-final second leg, holding a 3-0 lead.\nThat is followed by the visit of Bournemouth to Anfield in the Premier League at 17:30 BST on Saturday.\nEverton's next match is a Premier League trip to Swansea on Saturday (15:00 BST)"

It's good to be not so far from teams in the top 10.\"\nOn a dreadful night weather-wise on the south coast, Bournemouth had to wait until late in the game to get the winner.\nHenderson, deputising for injured first-choice keeper Sam Johnstone, had already produced a fine save to keep out Billing's header while Lloyd Kelly headed another great chance wide.\nThe closest Dominic Solanke came to adding to his 16 Premier League goals was when he fired into the side netting in the second half.\nBut Netherlands forward Kluivert sent fans home happy after great work by Semenyo.\nFive of Bournemouth's remaining eight games are away from home, including tough-looking matches at title-chasing Arsenal and Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa.\nThey are unlikely to hold much fear for Iraola's side, who are building confidence and momentum with an unbeaten Premier League run that stretches back to 24 February.\nFamiliar pattern for Palace\nFour months have passed since Crystal Palace supporters booed their own players off the pitch after a 2-0 home defeat by Bournemouth while an object was launched by a fan in the direction of then-manager Roy Hodgson.\nPalace have won just three Premier League matches since - losing seven - while they have replaced Hodgson with Oliver Glasner.\n\"If you don't score a goal you can't win,\" said the Austrian after his side's latest defeat. \"We had many good situations. You need to shoot. Maybe we have to improve, be more decisive in offensive positions.\"\nWith Joel Ward making his 300th top-flight appearance for the club, the Eagles were on their way to securing a hard-earned point when they conceded another late winner.\nIt has been a familiar pattern. Palace led 1-0 at Aston Villa back in September before letting in three late goals, while as recently as 9 March they had to make do with a point at home to Luton after conceding in the 96th minute.\nPalace remain eight points above the relegation zone but it is now just one win in eight, with a tough match at home to Treble-chasing Manchester City coming up on Saturday (12:30 BST)."

They closed the gap on sixth-placed Arsenal to two points and pulled six clear of Leicester in eighth.\nWatford, who had gone ahead just after the hour mark through Roberto Pereyra, drop a place to 12th despite dominating possession and creating more clear-cut scoring opportunities at Vicarage Road.\nBoss Javi Gracia said: \"We should have killed the game and after three minutes we have conceded two goals from two free-kicks again.\"\nDespite this latest setback, which follows heavy defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool and being pegged back in the final minute against Bournemouth last week, the Hornets are still well placed for a best top-flight finish for 31 years.\nWhere do Watford go from here?\nWatford hardly resemble a team that won once in 11 Premier League matches earlier in the season, resulting in the January dismissal of manager Marco Silva.\nWith fixtures looming against Huddersfield and Crystal Palace, they are still more than capable of equalling the feats of the 1986-87 squad, managed by Graham Taylor.\nInspired by a Liverpool-bound John Barnes, the Hornets finished ninth that year.\nGracia's immediate challenge is to eliminate the defensive errors undermining his team, after they slipped to a third defeat in four games.\nDefender Adrian Mariappa's looping header directly assisted the equaliser, and Cork was left unmarked to score the winning goal.\nBurnley's big three\nWhile Burnley's defensive resilience has underpinned their success this season, manager Sean Dyche has also followed a tried and tested formula with his strikers and tactics.\nWhen things are not going to plan, he switches formation and reverts to a 'big three' of Ashley Barnes, Chris Wood and Vokes at the apex of his attack.\nHis decision here to introduce Vokes and be more direct proved the catalyst for a remarkable turnaround on Saturday.\nVokes scored his first Clarets goal since November with his first touch, 22 seconds after entering the field as a substitute.\nThat means he, Barnes and Wood have been responsible for 68% of Burnley's goals this season.\nMan of the match - Nick Pope (Burnley)\nBurnley 'in a position to think of Europe' - what they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche on the possibility of Europa League qualification: \"There's a lot of games to go, a lot of football to be played, but the lads have put themselves in a good position to be thinking that.\n\"The reward for the lads is going into the final few games of the season, knowing the first marker has been achieved. Now they all enjoy their football.\n\"We know we didn't play well, but found a way. We had a scratch of luck, doing the ugly stuff. All that is important.\"\nOn Vokes' goal: \"I didn't think it would come that quickly of course, but a good finish. The players had a good mentality - they got us through.\n\"We're not going to slick it around every week. We played well at West Brom and West Ham, but a different way to win, blood and guts and working hard.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia: \"We dominated for most of the game, had more possession, more shots on target, 10 corners to one, but it wasn't enough. We should have killed the game and we didn't.\n\"They didn't surprise us, we knew their style of play. We lost in a similar way in the last game with two set-pieces. We are not happy today; we'll try to do better next time.\n\"We were ready to defend this and improve in those situations. Today we conceded two goals from two free-kicks.\n\"They score two goals in three minutes; we tried to work on this. We are conceding the last two games many goals this way, and we are losing points.\"\nWatford's first home league defeat under Gracia - the stats\nThis was Watford's first home league defeat under Gracia, with Swansea the last side to win at Vicarage Road in December.\nBurnley have won seven away games in the Premier League this season, their most in a top-flight campaign since 1965-66 (nine).\nThe Clarets won a Premier League away game in which they conceded the first goal for the first time since April 2010 (4-1 at Hull), ending a run of 29 defeats and seven draws when conceding first on the road.\nVokes' leveller was scored with his first touch of the game and just 22 seconds after coming off the bench - the fastest goal scored by a substitute in the Premier League this season.\nCork scored his first goal in 20 Premier League appearances, since netting against Swansea in November.\nPereyra has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time.\nWhat's next?\nWatford travel to the John Smith's Stadium to face Huddersfield next Saturday (15:00 BST).

We wasted a fantastic opportunity for this team to believe in themselves. It was not enough in the first half, it was better in the second half with our reaction, but it's a shame. We will discuss together.\n\"We know when we play sometimes like today against a team with a strong defensive unit, we have to play quickly and with quality. It was too slow. We believe in ourselves to come back with a good mentality, hard work in training and prepare for our next game with a good feeling.\"\nOn Riyad Mahrez's penalty appeal: \"Yeah, he [Paul Dummet] touched his foot, for me it is a penalty.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"It was amazing, the effort of the players, the way they were working, creating chances and the connection with the fans, who were amazing too.\n\"Leicester are always dangerous, they have the players who can hurt you, but we had three or four counter attacks where we could have done better. You cannot complain. We are closer [to safety] but we have to carry on. Nearly, but we have to carry on.\"\nOn whether Harry Maguire should have been sent off: \"I have had players sent off just for touching the face of a player. I cannot argue too much. And the main thing for us was the performance of the team, we deserved to win.\"\nShelvey ends long wait for Premier League goal - the stats\nNewcastle recorded their first victory at the King Power Stadium in all competitions, having previously lost three and drawn two.\nIt was a first defeat for Leicester in seven home Premier League games, since a 3-0 defeat by Crystal Palace in December (won two, drawn four).\nNewcastle have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since September.\nAyoze Perez both scored and assisted in a single Premier League game for just the third time in his career and first time since October 2015 v Norwich.\nJonjo Shelvey scored his first Premier League goal in 868 days, with that strike also his first for Newcastle in the top flight (39 appearances).\nJamie Vardy has scored in seven of his last nine Premier League appearances.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester's next fixture is a Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, 14 April (15:00 BST).\nA day later, Newcastle host Arsenal at St James' Park in the Sunday lunchtime kick-off (13:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Huddersfield Town\nHuddersfield claimed a potentially crucial point in their battle against relegation as they drew with 10-man Brighton at the Amex Stadium in a game that saw both sides end their recent goal droughts.\nThe Seagulls and the Terriers are hoping to secure another season of top-flight football after they were promoted from the Championship last year and three points in this game would have gone a long way to making that a reality.\nBrighton took the lead when the ball rebounded off Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl's head after he had pushed Solly March's shot onto the post.\nHuddersfield responded almost immediately as Steve Mounie pounced on Shane Duffy's terrible back pass to slot in.\nThe visitors' hopes of snatching victory were then boosted when Brighton midfielder Davy Propper was sent off for a late challenge on Jonathan Hogg.\nHowever, it was the hosts who could have taken the three points at the end when Jose Izquierdo was put through on goal - but the forward was superbly denied by Lossl.\nThe draw means Brighton are 13th, seven points above the relegation zone, while Huddersfield are 16th and four points above 18th-placed Southampton.\nRelive Saturday's Premier League action\nGoal droughts ended in a crazy couple of minutes\nNeither of these sides have been the Premier League entertainers in recent weeks.\nBrighton had gone a month without scoring while Huddersfield were approaching seven hours since their last goal.\nIt was, therefore, perhaps not surprising that their respective droughts were ended in somewhat fortuitous fashion.\nLossl can perhaps count himself unfortunate for Brighton's opener as he pushed March's shot onto the post and the ball rebounded back off his head and into the net.\nHuddersfield had come back only once before this season to get a result after falling behind but they were on level terms just two minutes later.\nDuffy inexplicably played the ball straight to Mounie and the Terriers' top scorer kept his composure to round the keeper and slot in his ninth goal of the season.\nA point earned or a missed opportunity?\nBrighton are probably one win away from making sure of their Premier League status for another season and with tough games against Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool to come, this was arguably their most winnable fixture.\nHowever, it would still take a big turnaround in form from the bottom three to see the Seagulls slip into trouble.\nAny away point is an important one in the Premier League but this was the second time in their last four games Huddersfield had failed to take advantage of their opponents going down to 10 men by snatching victory.\nBut the Terriers have given themselves that extra bit of breathing space and this was a considerably improved performance after disappointing displays in defeats by Crystal Palace and Newcastle.\nDavid Wagner's side attacked with pace, created chances and finished with more shots on target - five - than they had in their previous two games combined, when they managed just two. That should give them hope ahead of upcoming home games against Watford and Everton.\nMan of the match - Jonas Lossl (Huddersfield)\n'It wasn't our day' - what they said\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton, speaking to MOTD: \"It was a game where we were not at our best. Huddersfield scored from our mistake and we had the two best chances of the game. It wasn't our day today. I thought we had started very well. Their goal gave Huddersfield the lift they needed.\"\nOn the sending off: \"It is down to a referee on the day whether they want to send a player off for that challenge. You will see numerous challenges like that where there are two competitive players. At the time, I thought it was harsh.\"\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner, speaking to MOTD: \"An away point in the Premier League is a good point. It was a good performance from my side, it could have been a defeat or a win.\n\"The whole team showed great character today to come back in the circumstances, at this stage of the season, to come back when you are 1-0 down is good. I am absolutely happy with the performance.\n\"We fought until the final second. Both teams really wanted to win the game, that is what we have seen. I am still confident that more or less over the whole season we are capable of the chance to survive.\"\nSeeing red against the Terriers - the stats\nBrighton are unbeaten in their last six home league meetings with Huddersfield (W3 D3), since a 3-2 loss in League One in April 2011.\nHuddersfield have conceded in each of their past 14 on the road in the Premier League - the longest such run in the competition this season.\nThere have been more own goals scored in Premier League games involving Brighton this season than any other team (6 in total - 5 against, 1 for).\nCourtesy of Steve Mounie's 32nd minute strike, Huddersfield netted their first goal in 426 minutes of Premier League action.\nMounie has bagged three goals in his two Premier League games against Brighton this season, 43% of his total top-flight haul this season (3/7).\nHuddersfield have seen an opponent sent off four times in the top flight this season, a figure only Burnley can better (6).\nWhat next?\nBrighton travel to rivals Crystal Palace on 14 April (15:00 BST) while Huddersfield host Watford at the same time."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Swansea City\nWest Brom caretaker manager Darren Moore praised the \"first class\" response of his players as they ended their eight-game losing streak by drawing with Swansea.\nThe Premier League's bottom side remain 10 points from safety with five games left after Jay Rodriguez's second-half goal was cancelled out.\nSwansea took a point in their own fight for survival courtesy of Tammy Abraham's headed equaliser.\n\"I'm really delighted even though we couldn't hang on for the win,\" said Moore, who is in charge after the Baggies parted company with Alan Pardew earlier this month.\n\"I've had three days to work with them and I thought the players were first class.\n\"They did what I asked them to do and we almost came away with a good three points.\"\nMoore's side were kept out by an impressive display from visiting goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, who denied top scorer Rodriguez and Chris Brunt - before Rodriguez eventually put them ahead when he poked in Salomon Rondon's flick-on.\nCarlos Carvalhal's side stay 15th in the table - and four points clear of danger - after on-loan striker Abraham rose above marker Jake Livermore to head in a Sam Clucas corner.\nIt could have been better for the visitors, but striker Andre Ayew spurned a great chance, shooting wide after being played in by Clucas during an otherwise drab first half.\nThe only other opening had come when Albion midfielder Brunt struck a powerful drive that Fabianksi beat away.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nPlenty to work on for Moore\nWest Brom almost got the immediate new manager bounce they would have been hoping for after parting company with Alan Pardew five days ago.\nPopular former defender Moore took the reins with a call for unity and renewed fight - even if he admitted before this match that relegation looks likely.\nThat fate remains on the cards despite an improved first half from the hosts against a sluggish Swansea.\nMoore can take heart from the fact Rodriguez's goal came from a slick move - Matt Philips crossing for Rondon to flick on to Rodriguez to convert at the back post - and even more from his players' heads not dropping when Swansea levelled.\nCircumstances are bleak at The Hawthorns. They face the prospect of losing a clutch of players on the cheap should they go down.\nRondon, captain Jonny Evans, and at least two other players have relegation release clauses meaning they could move for fixed prices below their current value, which will add to the financial impact if they lose their top-flight status.\nBut Moore spoke afterwards about stopping the rot and that remains his brief in the short term.\nAs a former defender he might be frustrated that they conceded from Swansea's only effort on target, and that it was such a basic failure to properly mark Abraham.\nBut mathematically they still have a chance of staying up - and if he can help them cut out those errors, the most unlikely of survivals remains at least possible.\nSwans must improve for tough run-in\nLittle by little Swansea's revival under Carvalhal continues.\nThe charismatic Portuguese took over in December, winning five of his opening 10 Premier League matches and raising a smile with his colourful post-match metaphors.\nThe Welsh club were four points adrift at the bottom of the league before Carvalhal's appointment, but are now four above the relegation places.\nHowever, their form on the road remains patchy - they have won just one of their past 15 Premier League away games, losing nine.\nAnd this was far from convincing as Swansea - who lost defender Mike van der Hoorn to injury - laboured against the division's worst side.\nEven Abraham's first league goal since October was only a brief, if pivotal, moment of purpose.\nTheir remaining six fixtures feature Manchester City and Chelsea, along with two other sides fighting for survival in Stoke and Southampton.\nIt is a tough run-in and the Swans are going to have to do far better than this if they are to keep daylight between themselves and the Saints, who are 18th.\nOne positive was the display of Clucas, who created their best chance - wasted by Ayew - and delivered the goal.\nWest Brom keep dropping points - the stats\nWest Brom have lost 26 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, the most by a club in a single campaign since the 2012-13 season (Southampton 29 and Aston Villa 28).\nSwansea scored with their only effort on target in this match. They have had just 75 shots on target in the Premier League this season, fewer than any other side.\nAbraham's goal was his first in the Premier League since October, ending a run of 17 games without scoring in the competition.\nRodriguez has scored six Premier League goals this season - only in 2013-14 (15) has he scored more.\nRondon has either scored or assisted a goal in four consecutive Premier League games for the first time.\nJames McClean has failed to finish on the winning side in his past 23 Premier League games, the longest current run in the competition.\nMan of the match - Sam Clucas (Swansea)\n'They showed character to dig in' - what they said\nWest Brom caretaker boss Darren Moore: - \"I'm always one for if you don't win the game, you don't lose the game - but I'm really pleased they showed character to stay in it, dig in and work well with each other.\n\"One game at a time. We've come through this one with an overall team performance against a well-organised Swansea team that carries a threat. The way we played today was very good.\"\nSwans boss Carlos Carvalhal: \"I am pleased. After the game, we didn't talk too much about it but we knew West Brom would still be a difficult game even though they changed the manager.\n\"We must do better in the first half when we have the ball, but after the goal, we react and have a lot of strength in our head. The team had a fantastic reaction. We didn't give many opportunities to them in return to create chances.\n\"We aim to collect points with a good number and this is one more. We wanted more but luckily for us, we had time to react and collect one point.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom head to Old Trafford to face Manchester United next Sunday (16:00 BST), while Swansea host Everton at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-3 Manchester United\nManchester City must wait to secure the Premier League title after Manchester United mounted a remarkable second-half derby fightback to come from two goals down to win at Etihad Stadium.\nCity needed victory to be confirmed as champions but Paul Pogba scored two goals in two minutes to overturn City's first-half lead before Chris Smalling's volley completed the dramatic turnaround.\nPep Guardiola's side had delivered a first-half masterclass with captain Vincent Kompany scoring with a thumping header after 25 minutes and Ilkay Gudogan adding a second five minutes later after a clever turn and finish.\nOutclassed United remained in contention after Raheem Sterling skied two golden chances over the bar with the goal at his mercy and Gundogan headed straight at keeper David de Gea when unmarked eight yards out.\nIt gave United hope and how Jose Mourinho's team responded as Pogba - out of sorts at Old Trafford recently and at the centre of claims by Guardiola before the game that he had been offered to City in January - stole in to pull a goal back after 53 minutes and head the equaliser two minutes later.\nThe remarkable turnaround was complete when Smalling, badly at fault for Kompany's goal, arrived unmarked to steer Alexis Sanchez's free-kick past the exposed Ederson in the 69th minute.\nIn a furious finale, players from both sides clashed and Ashley Young was fortunate that his wild lunge on City substitute Sergio Aguero in the area was ignored by referee Martin Atkinson.\nDe Gea made a world-class one-handed save from Aguero as City attacked furiously - but United held out and Guardiola's title party must wait for another day.\nCity will win the title next weekend if they beat Tottenham at Wembley on the Saturday (19:45 BST kick-off) and United lose at home to bottom club West Brom on Sunday (16:00).\nChaotic & defying logic - how Man City's party fell flat\nMan Utd deserve more respect, says Mourinho after amazing comeback\nCity collapse puts title party on hold\nWhen Gundogan turned sweetly and poked a right-foot finish beyond De Gea after half an hour, the champagne was being placed on ice by Manchester City's supporters - and on the evidence up to that point no-one could blame them.\nCity were tearing United's fragile defence apart and Gundogan's goal was a fitting return for domination that had already brought them the lead through Kompany's header.\nIt was hard to see how the visitors, so passive and pedestrian, could do anything other than mount a damage-limitation exercise before City's title celebrations got under way.\nAnd then came what proved to be the decisive passage of play when Sterling sent two easy chances wildly over the top and Gundogan provided a tame headed finish to another great opportunity.\nIt left the door ajar for United - and they burst through it once manager Jose Mourinho had delivered his half-time message.\nWhen Pogba slipped through eight minutes after the interval to beat Ederson and give United hope, the defensive demons that put the skids under City in the Champions League quarter-final first leg at Liverpool on Wednesday surfaced once more.\nNicolas Otamendi, so solid and improved before that 3-0 loss, lost Pogba in the area as he headed home to restore parity in the space of two minutes, and City's defenders were once again caught off-guard when Smalling was left totally unmarked to turn in Alexis Sanchez's free-kick after 69 minutes.\nCity were stunned - flaws exposed. Pep Guardiola's side conceded three in 19 minutes at Anfield and three in 16 minutes here. Lightning had struck twice in the space of four days.\nIt was only the brilliance of De Gea, with a world-class save from substitute Aguero, that stopped City rescuing the respectability of a point - but there was a serious sense of anti-climax around the Etihad at the final whistle.\nCity felt they were on the wrong end of several decisions from referee Martin Atkinson, particularly when Young clearly followed through on Aguero in the area in the second half, but they only have themselves to blame after the failure to take those first half chances and that second-half defensive collapse.\nIndeed, one City supporter - and not a child either - was in tears in his seat in the stand. He will cheer up when the title formalities are complete, but this was a bitter pill to swallow for Guardiola, his team and their fans.\nPogba raises game to lift United\nPogba's first-half performance aroused comment for two reasons - the manner in which he was outmanoeuvred in midfield and a hair colour that looked suspiciously like an unwitting title tribute to Manchester City with its flashes of blue.\nThe man Guardiola claimed was offered to Manchester City in January was as off the pace as his team-mates and social media would not have made pleasant reading for the France playmaker.\nBut how it all turned in the space of two minutes early in the second half as the tall, long-striding Pogba flipped the game on its head and opened up the possibility of a United victory that seemed light years away at half-time.\nAnd what resolve Mourinho's side showed to dig their way out of the hole they found themselves in after 45 minutes, stirring themselves for a comeback that will at least give them pride that they did not allow City to have their title celebration at their expense.\nTrue, they rode their luck as Young somehow escaped punishment for that reckless challenge on Aguero in the area, but they scrapped it out and relished the feisty later exchanges when City's discipline deserted them.\nThis will not stop City winning the title but it will give United a real sense of satisfaction in a season where they have been comprehensively overshadowed by their neighbours.\nRelive Manchester United's stunning comeback win at Manchester City\nFootball Daily podcast: Man Utd delay City's title celebrations\nCan City pick themselves up for Champions League?\nLiverpool, who come to the Etihad protecting that 3-0 lead in the Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday, will have watched events unfolding here with mixed emotions.\nIn the first half, City looked every inch a side with the capability to overturn that deficit as they dazzled in attack and left United chasing shadows in midfield.\nIn the second, they looked like a team who would be easy prey for Liverpool's goalscoring triumvirate of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and, if fit, Mohamed Salah.\nCity's performance was two-faced and Guardiola will know that just one piece of the frailty they have demonstrated in conceding six goals in their past two games will be fatal against the Reds' potent attack.\nGuardiola will also know City must sustain the level of the first half for 90 minutes and eradicate the errors of the second or their Champions League campaign will be over.\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\n'Can we improve enough next season?'\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho speaking to Sky Sports: \"We moved the ball more than any team has against Manchester City. We pressed a bit higher and we kept the shape to get a good result.\n\"I think mathematically we need six points to stay in the top four and this win is part of that.\n\"Our challenge is to finish second but I want to congratulate City for the title - because they are going to win and deservedly. They gave no chance to the others because they had this season of not stopping winning.\n\"My objective here was to get points and not spoil any celebrations. The point is can we improve enough to catch them next season?\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Sport: \"To concede three goals against a very good team is tough.\n\"We were the team that conceded the least goals. United created four chances, which isn't too much. How many chances did we create? Much, much, more. But you have to put the ball in the net.\"\nUnited's comeback kings - the best of the stats\nCity lost a Premier League game they were winning by a two-goal margin for the first time since October 2008.\nUnited have won nine Premier League away games when trailing by at least two goals - four more than any other side in the competition.\nThis was the first time a side managed by Pep Guardiola has conceded at least three goals in consecutive games in all competitions, having lost 3-0 to Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nGuardiola lost a game in which his side was winning by a two-goal margin for the first time since December 2013, when his Bayern Munich side lost 3-2 to Manchester City.\nBoth Smalling and Pogba have won all nine Premier League games in which they have scored - only former Liverpool forward Ryan Babel has a better 100% record in the competition (11/11).\nThere were just 97 seconds between Pogba's first and second goals.\nUnited forward Alexis Sanchez has provided two assists in a Premier League game for only the second time, also doing so against Newcastle in December 2014.\nSanchez has had a hand in four goals in his past two Premier League games for Manchester United (one goal, three assists).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City welcome Liverpool for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday (19:45 BST kick-off) before travelling to Wembley to take on Tottenham in the Premier league on Saturday (19:45).\nManchester United host bottom side West Brom to Old Trafford in the league next Sunday (16:00)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-2 Southampton\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger praised the \"exceptional\" mental strength of Danny Welbeck after the striker ended a goalless run of 16 Premier League games to score two and assist the other as the Gunners fought back to beat Southampton.\nWenger had made seven changes with Thursday's Europa League quarter-final second leg against CSKA Moscow in mind, and his side trailed when Shane Long capitalised on a first-half mix-up between keeper Petr Cech and centre-back Shkodran Mustafi.\nBut the hosts recovered with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang prodding in his sixth goal since joining from Borussia Dortmund for \u00a356m in January to level before Welbeck - who created the equaliser with a clever flick - put them ahead.\nSouthampton then drew level when substitute Charlie Austin turned in Cedric Soares' cross but Welbeck headed Arsenal back in front after both sides missed a string of chances, leaving the visitors deep in relegation trouble.\n\"It's not easy because we played against a team who fights not to go down, mentally it is very difficult,\" Wenger said.\n\"Some of our players had heavy legs but we still won the game when we were questioned, I really like the spirit in this team.\n\"Every game you win makes you stronger, it's important that you keep your run going. We have gone through a difficult spell, but because the players are proud we came back. Now we hope to keep this going.\"\nSouthampton must 'go to war' - Austin\nHe singled out Welbeck's contribution in the game at Emirates Stadium after the 27-year-old scored for the first time in the league since September, then got the winner after shooting high over the bar from close range four minutes earlier.\n\"I think I have repeated that I really like Danny Welbeck,\" Wenger said.\n\"I am very pleased for him because he is a guy who went through a very difficult time and has shown exceptional mental strength to come back.\"\nMark Hughes' men, who had defender Jack Stephens sent off in added time before Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny was also dismissed, remain 18th in the table and three points from safety.\nThe south-coast outfit also had a second Long goal ruled out for offside and defender Wesley Hoedt saw his header cleared off the line by Elneny.\nGoalkeeper Alex McCarthy had kept the visitors' second-half hopes alive with a string of impressive stops to deny Aubameyang, Granit Xhaka and Alex Iwobi.\nLate drama lifts Emirates inertia\nA sterile first-half atmosphere at the Emirates, after a similarly muted last league win against Stoke, was transformed by a dramatic second half in north London.\nArsenal won over their supporters with a display of grit to keep their winning momentum going as the focus shifts to Europe again.\nIt is now six consecutive triumphs in all competitions and they sit sixth in the Premier League table.\nAnd this 150th win at their home ground since they left Highbury in 2006, adds more weight to Wenger's claim that their relative woes this term maybe require a little perspective.\nThey seem almost certain to miss out on the top four again this season after that happened last term for the first time in 20 years.\nBut even without the influential Mesut Ozil and Jack Wilshere in their starting line-up they had the mental strength to take all three points against determined opposition.\n\"If you look at our home season, people have seen good football here and I read somewhere that we were the third best team in the league with our home results,\" Wenger said last week.\nAfter leading twice, two late red cards and and a surprisingly loud roar at the final whistle, there was certainly entertainment at the Emirates on Sunday despite the empty seats.\nWenger and his players head to Moscow with a spring in their step, still believing they can reach the Champions League next season by winning the Europa League. They hold a 4-1 advantage from the first leg of the quarter-final.\nSaints show better attacking instinct\nStatistics do not always tell the full story, especially in a game when Southampton gave so much, but the numbers are stacking up against them with time running out.\nIt is just one win in 19 league matches now and they have conceded six goals in two league games since Hughes replaced the sacked Mauricio Pellegrino in the middle of March.\nThe hard luck tales kept coming on Sunday. James Ward-Prowse had a goalbound shot cleared off the line by Hector Bellerin, Hoedt too went close and Welbeck's first Arsenal goal took a deflection off Maya Yoshida.\nBut if they keep alive the battling spirit they displayed against Arsenal, they might still make it to safety.\nWard-Prowse, making his 200th appearance for the club aged just 23, ran further and made more sprints than anyone else on the pitch, and Long constantly stretched Arsenal with darts behind their defence.\nIt does not get any easier for them, though, with fifth-placed Chelsea up next before a trip to Leicester, who are eighth.\nBut while they were toothless in attack during their previous 3-0 defeat at West Ham, this time they had more shots on target than their expensively assembled hosts.\nThe question is whether Hughes has enough time left to implement his ideas.\nSaints have six Premier League games remaining, as well as an FA Cup semi-final, and there were signs here they are finding some resilience.\nGunners shine at home - the stats\nArsenal have won six matches in a row in all competitions for the first time since May 2017 (also six).\nThe Gunners have scored three or more goals in five successive home games in all competitions for the first time since their opening six matches of the 1958-59 season.\nSouthampton have lost three successive away league matches conceding at least three goals in each for the first time since September 2013, under Nigel Adkins (a run of four).\nSouthampton have not won any of their last six Premier League games in which they have opened the scoring (drawn four, lost two).\nDanny Welbeck both scored and assisted in a Premier League match for the first time since September (against Bournemouth), which was also the last time he netted a league goal.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in seven goals in his first seven Premier League games (six goals, one assist), more than any other player in their first seven appearances for the Gunners.\nShane Long has scored four goals against Arsenal in the Premier League, only against Aston Villa (six) has the Irishman netted more often.\nIn fact, only Wayne Rooney (seven) and Robin van Persie (six) have scored more Premier League goals against Petr Cech than Shane Long (five).\nCharlie Austin has scored in each of his four Premier League games against Arsenal (four goals), including in both of his appearances at the Emirates.\n'Wilshere could have been sent off too' - what they said\nSouthampton boss Mark Hughes, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We have difficult games coming up, we know that but we have to show qualities and strength in our mindset. Our confidence has been a bit low but it won't be damaged by today, it will be enhanced.\"\nOn Jack Stephens' red card: \"I've got to be careful, it's not an easy role clearly but Jack reacted to Wilshere pulling him back, he was reacting to get rid of him, and I'm a bit disappointed that the ref didn't see what I thought was a movement with his knee - he could have been sent off as well.\"\nMan of the match - Danny Welbeck (Arsenal)\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to CSKA Moscow on Thursday for the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final (20:05 BST), while Southampton host Chelsea on Saturday (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-1 West Ham United\nJavier Hernandez's second-half equaliser boosted West Ham's Premier League survival prospects and damaged Chelsea's slim hopes of finishing in the top four on an emotional day at Stamford Bridge.\nCesar Azpilicueta had prodded the hosts ahead following Alvaro Morata's knock down, and the Spaniard dedicated his goal to the club's former England midfielder Ray Wilkins, who died on Wednesday aged 61.\nThere was also a minute's applause prior to kick-off, with the Chelsea players wearing black armbands in memory of Wilkins.\nHowever, Hernandez, on as a substitute, struck his ninth career goal against the Blues to earn a point for the Hammers.\nThe Mexican's effort, driven into the corner after Marko Arnautovic's fine cut-back, moves David Moyes' team six points clear of the relegation places.\nIt was only West Ham's third touch inside the Chelsea's penalty area.\nIn contrast, Antonio Conte's men - who are in fifth but 10 points behind Tottenham and Liverpool above them - had 23 shots on goal and were good value for their lead for long periods.\nAnd but for a combination of profligate finishing and excellent goalkeeping from West Ham keeper Joe Hart - on loan from league leaders Manchester City - the Blues would have realised that aim.\nChelsea FA Cup win 'will not save season'\nFootball Daily podcast: 'Chelsea's top-four hopes are over'\nHernandez saves the day for Hammers\nMoyes' horrendous record at Stamford Bridge looked well on course to stretch to a ninth defeat in a 15-game winless run.\nThe Scot has still not managed a victory from 30 outings against a 'big six' side since a 2-1 win for Everton over Manchester City in December 2010 - but Hernandez's strike altered the complexion of the game while delivering a precious point.\nThe 29-year-old, whose future and relationship with his manager has been questioned, once again showed his predatory instincts to turn the ball beyond Thibaut Courtois three minutes after coming on.\nHernandez has now appeared four times as a substitute at Stamford Bridge in the league - and scored on all four occasions.\nThis was the former Manchester United forward's ninth in 14 appearances against Chelsea, more than he has managed against any other Premier League opponent.\nStamford Bridge pays tribute to Wilkins\nAfter an earlier a pre-match tribute, the stadium rose in the eighth minute to acclaim their former number eight Wilkins.\nA midfielder of grace and vision, Wilkins, who also worked as assistant manager at Chelsea, was revered at Stamford Bridge and would have enjoyed the performance of Eden Hazard, a player that exemplifies those qualities in Conte's modern-day team.\nWith West Ham in stifling mode, the Belgium forward cut loose after 20 minutes.\nExploiting the space behind Cheikhou Kouyate, Hazard fashioned a series of chances for the Blues to wrap things up before the break.\nAs his influence grew, Morata also came alive. The Spaniard had two goals disallowed for offside and Hazard was unfortunate to be denied a late winner by Hart's excellent positioning.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\n'We can see our season in this game' - what they said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"I think with this game we can see our season. We can create a lot of chances but we cannot take them.\n\"We are not clinical and then we concede two shots and concede a goal.\n\"When you don't score but create the chances it's very difficult to win. This game explains our season.\"\nOn forwards potentially lacking confidence: \"Morata scored two offside goals. He does not lack confidence and we created enough chances for Hazard, Willian and Morata to score. But I repeat, this game explains our season.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes: \"It certainly is a prized point for us. We were playing against a team who are quality and have some terrific attacking players who played well.\n\"The key was that we were never out of it, because the way they got the first goal was diabolical. Chelsea can get a goal in other ways but from a corner was really bad from our point of view.\"\nOn substitute Javier Hernandez scoring the equaliser: \"Chicharito won't thank me for bringing him on as a substitute, but he's a great penalty box striker and he always gets goals.\n\"Every time you open up against Chelsea it's a bit dangerous, but we defended well on the whole.\"\nFirst-time failure for Conte's Blues - the stats\nChelsea failed to win a league game at home under Conte in which they led at half-time for the first time - ending an 18-match run.\nWest Ham avoided defeat in an away Premier League game against the reigning champions for only the third time. They beat Manchester United in 2001-02 and drew 2-2 at Chelsea in 2015-16.\nAll five of Azpilicueta's league goals in 191 Chelsea appearances have come against teams beginning with W (two against Watford, two against West Brom and now one against West Ham).\nMorata's assist for Azpilicueta was the seventh time the two have combined in the Premier League this season - no two players have combined for more goals this campaign.\nMoyes has not won any of his 20 away matches at Stamford Bridge as a manager with five clubs (Preston, Everton, Manchester United, Sunderland and West Ham), losing 13.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to the south coast to face struggling Southampton on Saturday (12:30 BST kick-off). West Ham welcome relegation-threatened Stoke to London Stadium on Monday, 16 April (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 2-3 Chelsea\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte says his team showed \"the right fire in our eyes\" as they mounted a remarkable comeback from 2-0 down to win at Southampton.\nThe victory - thanks to three goals in eight second-half minutes - kept alive their faint hopes of a top-four finish in the Premier League.\nDusan Tadic's opener, a placed effort following Ryan Bertrand's marauding run, and Polish defender Jan Bednarek's left-footed shot looked to be lifting Saints out of the bottom three.\nBut, with Mark Hughes seemingly on course for a first league victory as Southampton manager since arriving on 14 March, the entrance of substitute Olivier Giroud, who scored twice, sparked a listless Chelsea into life.\nThe France forward's header - his first league goal for Antonio Conte's team - and left-footed drive sandwiched Eden Hazard's left-foot finish as the Blues moved within seven points of fourth-placed Tottenham.\n\"I was very angry from our first half,\" Conte said. \"In the second half we showed great character, great determination and desire to win the game. We showed the right fire in our eyes.\"\nFor an hour, Chelsea's performance epitomised their travails since the turn of the year, with the defending champions having collected just 12 points from the previous 33 available.\nWillian's 55th-minute shot was their first effort on target, and there were question marks over the application of several players in the build-up to both Saints goals.\nOne of those players - wing-back Marcos Alonso who crossed for Giroud's header - was also fortunate to escape without punishment for standing on the back of Southampton forward Shane Long's calf in the first half.\nThe incident left the Southampton manager furious and calling for the Football Association to take retrospective action, which could potentially rule Alonso out of next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final rematch between the clubs.\n\"It was a poor challenge, it should have been a red card in my view,\" Hughes said.\n\"I don't think he was booked, so maybe people need to look at that again, retrospectively. Thankfully he's just about OK, but he's been raked down the calf.\n\"We're not here to accuse people, and no sour grapes, but a decision needs to be made on that because it's not acceptable.\"\nMatch of the Day pundit Alan Shearer agreed that action needs to be taken following the challenge.\n\"I don't know how he didn't see it as he was only five yards away. He has to say he can't see it because if he did, he had to send him off,\" Shearer said.\n\"I'm pretty sure there will be retrospective action. Mike Dean should have seen that.\"\nSouthampton remain 18th as they try to avoid slipping into the Championship for the first time since 2011-12.\nNo respite for Southampton or Hughes\nAfter being sacked by Stoke, Hughes is facing the ignominious prospect of playing a part in the relegation of two clubs this season.\nThe upturn in results the Saints board hoped for when the Welshman was brought in to replace Mauricio Pellegrino just over a month ago has not materialised.\nWhile an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea is on the horizon, Hughes has presided over three successive league defeats, with three goals conceded in each match.\nFollowing an abject 3-0 defeat at West Ham, there were encouraging signs in a 3-2 defeat at Arsenal last Sunday, and more of the same against Chelsea.\nSouthampton controlled proceedings for about 70 minutes, but their biggest problem is turning performances into points.\n\"Some of our guys are up for what we've got ahead of ourselves,\" Hughes said.\n\"I'm learning about the group more and more each training session and match. We're still conceding goals and they're just slips in concentration.\"\nOne victory in 20 league matches - against bottom club West Brom - does not bode well for the Saints though, who could be six points adrift of safety later.\nConte changes the flow\nMuch of Chelsea's display typified the problems that have undermined their defence of the title and have been exacerbated by speculation over the future of Conte.\nThe Italian has not helped himself at times, allowing himself to become embroiled in a public spat with Manchester United counterpart Jose Mourinho and at times cutting a desolate figure on the touchline.\nThere was again an absence of emotion and touchline theatrics that marked first season at Stamford Bridge, but Conte did turn this contest on its head with the introduction of Giroud and Pedro.\n\"In the first half we didn't play well but not just that, they put more into the tempo than us,\" Conte said.\n\"The most important thing is to show in every game the right passion and to fight until the end. We need to finish this season in the best possible way.\n\"I don't know why the desire wasn't there but the coach is the first person to have the fault. It doesn't matter that we won the game 3-2, it was important to see the right reaction and fight in the eyes of my players.\"\nChelsea had lacked conviction in front of goal until Giroud replaced Alvaro Morata, while Davide Zappacosta had a largely forgettable afternoon before being withdrawn for Pedro.\nThe former Torino man was caught out of position for Tadic's opening goal and had just 11 touches in Southampton territory during the first period.\nBy contrast Ryan Bertrand created the opening goal for Saints and appeared to be almost permanently stationed in the Chelsea half, having 23 touches.\nGiroud, though, made the difference - scoring twice from his two efforts on goal.\n\"Chelsea needed someone up front to battle for the team. As soon as Giroud, came on, they were able to play and bomb forward. They didn't have anyone up front to hold it and keep them in the game until he came on,\" Match of the Day pundit Wright said.\n\"Someone like Giroud knows how to come off the bench and make an impact.\"\nMan of the match - Olivier Giroud (Chelsea)\n'Super-sub Giroud' - the stats\nSouthampton have lost consecutive Premier League games after scoring two or more goals for the first time ever.\nChelsea have won a Premier League game from two goals down for the first time since August 2002 under Claudio Ranieri (3-2 v Charlton).\nHughes is only the second manager to lose three Premier League games against the same opponent in a single season after Graeme Souness vs Arsenal in 2004-05.\nThe Blues have won five in a row against Saints in the league for the first time ever.\nTadic has been directly involved in 45 Premier League goals since his debut in August 2014 (18 goals, 27 assists), 14 more than any other Southampton player.\nBednarek is only the third Polish player to score in the Premier League, after Robert Warzycha in 1992 and Marcin Wasilewski in 2015\nGiroud has netted 19 goals in the Premier League as a sub, a haul only Jermain Defoe can better (24).\nGiroud is also the top-scoring sub in the Premier League this season, with six goals from the bench.\nGiroud is the first player to score an away goal against the same opponent for different clubs in a single Premier League season since Mikel Arteta (for Everton and Arsenal v Blackburn 2011/12).\nHazard has scored 69 Premier League goals for Chelsea; only Frank Lampard (147) and Didier Drogba (104) have netted more.\nWhat's next?\nBoth clubs play again before facing each other in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on 22 April (15:00 BST). Southampton travel to Leicester City on Thursday, 19 April (19:45 BST kick-off), while Chelsea visit Turf Moor to play Burnley on the same evening (19:45 BST kick-off)."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 1-0 Watford\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner said his side's \"job isn't done\" despite an \"emotional\" late victory over Watford that moved them seven points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\nSubstitute Tom Ince's goal in injury time won the match for the Terriers with their first shot on target against well organised opponents at the John Smith's Stadium.\nHuddersfield face Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal in their final three games, after hosting Everton on 28 April.\nAsked if Saturday's win over 12th-placed Watford guarantees their safety, Wagner said: \"I have no idea, nobody knows.\n\"We need further points. The job isn't done, but with this performance the players are very focused and sharp. We have good momentum - and that is exactly what we need.\n\"It was a fantastic finish and a great afternoon for us - very emotional. The game was very weary, not a lot of cleat-cut chances for both teams. Both defended well and were very organised.\n\"We have this magic moment and all the emotions came out, and I am so pleased for the players and the fans who pushed us and I am glad we gave them something to celebrate.\n\"This is what it is all about this game - about emotion. Everyone who supports Huddersfield knows how important this is for the history.\"\nThe breakthrough came as Huddersfield defender Mathias Jorgensen latched on to a long punt into the area and squared the ball to Ince, who fired in from five yards.\nCaptain Jonathan Hogg's drive that went narrowly wide and a blocked Ince shot were among the few chances the hosts had mustered until the dramatic finale, with Javi Gracia's side unlucky when two goal-bound efforts were deflected wide.\nWatford keeper Orestis Karnezis had been a virtual spectator before the goal, and his side perhaps deserved a point that would have eased any lingering fears the 12th-placed Hornets have of being dragged back into trouble.\nHuddersfield's Alex Pritchard and Watford's Roberto Pereyra were booked for diving but the game was was free of any major refereeing incidents - which was probably welcomed by fourth official Michael Oliver, who was back on Premier League duty after overseeing Real Madrid's controversial Champions League win over Juventus in midweek.\nWhat else happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nSuper sub Giroud and Burnley match class of 1968 - the best stats\nGoals still hard to come by for Terriers\nThe scenes of delight at the final whistle were reminiscent of last May when Huddersfield clinched promotion from the Championship.\nWhile Christopher Schindler's winning penalty in a tense play-off final shootout did it then, here it was more late drama.\nBut while Premier League survival now feels a lot more likely despite that daunting run-in, staying up again next term could depend on Wagner finding more goals.\nForward Steve Mounie is Huddersfield's top scorer with nine in all competitions and Ince's winner on Saturday was the side's second in their past six games. Owner Dean Hoyle may well be asked to bankroll more attacking talent in the transfer market this summer.\nFor the time being, though, their commendable spirit and perseverance will be a key asset as they face some of the top sides looking for the extra points that will really allow them to relax.\nA dramatic defeat for fellow strugglers Southampton earlier was an early boost on Saturday and the home fans cheered as news of Chelsea's comeback on the south coast filtered through.\nThey were still cheering at the end - 90 minutes of low-quality, tense football forgiven thanks to one vital moment.\nShot-shy Watford unlucky\nThis was a fourth defeat in five games for Watford, whose season continues to meander to its end.\nDespite this setback, which follows heavy losses at Arsenal and Liverpool, being pegged back in the final minute against Bournemouth and defeat by Burnley, the Hornets could still record their best top-flight finish for 31 years.\nThey must now overhaul Everton in ninth to equal the 1986-87 squad, managed by Graham Taylor - but Gracia may well be more concerned with the confidence-sapping effects of another late blow.\nThey saw three points become one back at Vicarage Road against the Cherries when Jermain Defoe's injury-time equaliser went in, and two goals in three minutes undid them against the Clarets.\nOn Saturday in west Yorkshire, they had more possession with 51%, more attempts on target and largely defended well.\nBut then they fell to that late sucker-punch and Gracia must find a way to lift his side before they face another club fighting for survival in Crystal Palace next Saturday.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure was unlucky not to score when his drive was deflected wide by Jonathan Hogg's leg. Troy Deeney also saw a goalbound strike turned behind.\nMidfielder Pereyra did not help their attacking efforts either, sending two corners straight out of play, and like their opponents they struggled in the final third.\nDeeney only managed one effort all game, and substitute Richarlison fared no better.\nAny feelings of misfortune were justified afterwards, but if they are to end the season on a high the hard luck stories cannot be allowed to mount up.\nMan of the match - Jonathan Hogg (Huddersfield)\nHome sweet home again for Huddersfield - the stats\nHuddersfield have won two of their past four Premier League games at home after failing to win any of the previous five.\nIn contrast, Watford have picked up one point from a possible 30 away from home since December.\nGracia is yet to see Watford score a league goal in his first five matches on the road - the last boss to have such a record was Gus Poyet after taking charge of Sunderland in 2013.\nIndeed, the Hornets have failed to score in eight of their past 10 Premier League games on the road, including the past six.\nInce has scored one goal in his past five league games against Watford - only against Bristol City (eight), Rotherham (seven) and Millwall (five) has the winger scored more league goals.\n'It wasn't fair' - what they said\nWatford manager Javi Gracia said: \"The last few games football has been cruel for us - in two games we have lost in added time.\n\"Huddersfield dominated the first half. In the second half we felt better with more possession - but in the last moment conceded.\n\"I prefer to be focused on the next game to try to do better. It wasn't fair and we have to try to get points in the next game.\"\nMatch of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said: \"I think Huddersfield Town got a sense of how important victory was with the relief at the final whistle. You could hear it in the ground.\n\"They believe that win will keep them up.\"\nWhat's next?\nHuddersfield host Everton in the league on Saturday, 28 April AT 15:00 BST, while Watford welcome Crystal Palace to Vicarage Road next Saturday (21 April) at 15:00."

We have had some tough times and some very good times.\n\"Who knows what it will bring but we will just wait and see.\"\nWhat happened in the Premier League on Saturday?\nReaction from Turf Moor and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nLeicester wasted several chances before Jamie Vardy's powerful finish reduced the deficit, but Burnley hung on to open up a nine point lead on their eighth-placed opponents with five games to play.\nFoxes boss Claude Puel said afterwards that his side's chances of qualifying for the Europa League were all but over.\n\"I think so, yes,\" said the Frenchman.\n\"Of course there are games remaining but they [Burnley] now have a lot of chances.\"\nEurope beckons for Burnley after 51-year absence\nThe Clarets are well placed to play in Europe for the first time since the 1966-67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which later became the Uefa Cup.\nDyche and his players have won an army of admirers for an extraordinary season in which Burnley are on course to finish in the top seven on a reported wage bill of just \u00a337m.\n, external\nThis is the first time the Lancashire club have won five consecutive matches in the top flight since November 1968 and the latest success typified their season.\nAll the key ingredients were there - hard work, grit, determination - as Leicester threw everything at them in the second half.\nWood reached double figures for league goals this season after being played in by Ashley Barnes, before an unmarked Long pounced from a corner for his first Premier League goal for the club.\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate witnessed Burnley's latest win, and will have been impressed with goalkeeper Nick Pope.\nHe played his part in his side's 14th league victory of the season by denying Riyad Mahrez and, before he scored, Vardy.\nDyche was singled out for particular praise by Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer for guiding Burnley through their unbeaten run.\n\"Once they score one or two goals, they're difficult to peg back because they don't concede many,\" Shearer said.\n\"Burnley are either going to finish sixth or seventh. They went from December to February without a Premier League win, Sean Dyche has to be one of the, if not the, manager of the season.\"\nRelive the action from Turf Moor\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche on club's Europa League chances\nWasteful Foxes pay the price\nVardy scored for the fourth successive league game to take his top-flight tally this season to 17, but he was also responsible, along with others, for some poor misses.\nAt the end of the first half, and with Burnley 2-0 up, the England striker tamely headed wide after Harry Maguire's pin-point cross.\nMahrez, who clipped the post with a free-kick, also should have scored on a disappointing day at both ends for the Foxes, who gave a first Premier League start to 20-year-old midfielder Hamza Choudhury.\nVardy's goal, after substitute Kelechi Iheanacho's clever pass, was little consolation for manager Claude Puel, who lost goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to injury in the closing stages.\n\"He took a heavy knock and we will have to see whether he can be fit for our next game,\" added Puel.\nThe Frenchman took over in October when the team was 14th in the table.\nAlthough Leicester are on course for a top-half finish, Puel has his work cut out to improve Leicester in the summer.\nExplainer - how seventh place gets into Europe\nThe fifth-placed team in the Premier League will enter the Europa League at the group stage, as will the FA Cup winners.\nBecause Manchester City have already guaranteed their Champions League place, their Europa League place as EFL Cup winners reverts to the league, so the sixth-placed team will also enter the Europa League.\nRealistically, unless Southampton win the FA Cup, the seventh-placed team will also qualify for the Europa League (as the other three semi-finalists - Manchester United, Chelsea and Spurs - look almost certain to finish in the top six).\nFA Cup runners-up are no longer eligible to enter Europe by virtue of being losing finalists.\nIf Arsenal win the Europa League and finish outside the top four, they will qualify for the Champions League, and only two English sides will enter the Europa League as no more than seven clubs from each country can compete in Europe.\nThe run-in - who plays who?\nMan of the match - Nick Pope (Burnley)\nAnother Vardy goal, another defeat - the stats\nVardy has been on the losing side in eight Premier League games this season when he has scored, a record for a single campaign in the competition.\nVardy has scored in eight of his past 10 Premier League appearances (8 goals), after finding the back of net in just three of his 12 games before that (3 goals).\nThis is the first time Burnley have scored two goals inside the opening 10 minutes of Premier League game.\nIt is also just the first time Leicester conceded two goals within the first 10 minutes of a Premier League game since August 2003.\nWood has been directly involved in six goals in his five Premier League games since coming back from injury (5 goals, 1 assists).\nGudmundsson has provided seven assists in the Premier League this season, two more than any other Burnley player has ever managed in a single campaign in the competition.\nLong has registered goal involvements in consecutive league games (1 goal, 1 assist) for the first time since December 2011 for Accrington.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley and Leicester are back in Premier League action on Thursday as they host teams who are involved in next weekend's FA Cup semi-finals.

First they did not track Milivojevic and allowed him to carry the ball into the area after a short corner and then they failed to clear another corner before Tomkins scrambled the ball home.\nMurray pulled Brighton back into the game with his smart finish but defending again cost the visitors when Ezequiel Schelotto let Zaha to head in unchallenged at the back post to restore Palace's lead.\n\"They were three poor goals from our point of view,\" manager Chris Hughton. \"What we will do is talk about the second half and the fact we gave ourselves a chance but it's almost impossible to turn it around when you give away the goals we gave away.\"\nBrighton moved into 10th place when they beat Arsenal on 4 March but have since only collected one point from four games.\nThey have a game in hand over their relegation rivals and a seven-point gap but their remaining five games are all against teams in the top seven.\nThe Seagulls have home games against Spurs and Manchester United to come and also have to travel to Burnley, Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\"We knew we had a difficult run in and knew we would have to get a result that nobody expected us to be able to get,\" Hughton said.\"\n\"We've put ourselves in this position and it's down to us to get those points.\"\nYou can't defend like that and expect points' - analysis\nFormer Newcastle defender Alan Shearer on Match of the Day: \"You can't expect to take points from a Premier League game defending like Brighton did in the first half.\n\"They have conceded more set-piece goals than anyone in the league.\n\"Palace didn't play with a centre-forward and Brighton didn't know who to mark. Wilfried Zaha was excellent and everything they did well went through him.\n\"For his goal he started the move, nobody was tight on him, then it was a brilliant ball in and again nobody was picking him up. He darts in and it was a hell of a header.\n\"Zaha and Andros Townsend did all their good work down the left.\"\nMan of the match- Wilfried Zaha\nZaha's headed first - the best stats\nCrystal Palace ended a run of four top-flight home games without a victory (D1 L3), netting three goals in a league game at Selhurst Park for the first time since May 2017 (4-0 v Hull).\nBrighton have conceded in each of the past 12 Premier League games - the longest current run without a clean sheet in the division.\nThis game saw five first-half goals, the most in any Premier League game this season.\nWilfried Zaha has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March 2015 (v QPR and Stoke).\nIn completing his first-ever Premier League double, Zaha netted his first-ever headed goal in the competition.\nZaha has now bagged five goals against Brighton in all competitions, more than he has managed against any other side, with four of those goals coming in his last three against the Seagulls.\nBrighton have conceded 14 goals from corner situations this season, more than any other side.\nGlenn Murray has scored three goals in the past two league meetings between these two sides in the league at Selhurst Park (excl. play-offs), scoring twice in a 3-0 win for Palace in December 2012.\nMurray is the fifth player to score against Crystal Palace in the Premier League having previously played for them in the competition, and the first since Leon McKenzie in April 2005 (for Norwich).\nWhat's next?\nPalace's next match sees them travel to Vicarage Road to play Watford next Saturday (15:00 BST kick-off).

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-1 Everton\nEverton boss Sam Allardyce praised Wayne Rooney's midfield performance as they picked up a point against Swansea City.\nThe 32-year-old had reacted angrily after being substituted just after half-time in the Toffees' goalless Merseyside derby draw against Liverpool on 7 April.\nDespite a dominant start from Swansea, during which they had two shots cleared off the line, a Kyle Naughton own goal put Everton ahead.\nSwansea kept control however, and their pressure paid off as Jordan Ayew levelled with a cool finish from inside the box.\n\"Wayne only had one shot but his contribution in possession was getting us moving forward better than our other midfield players and I was pleased with him,\" Allarydce told BBC Sport.\n\"I was pleased with everybody's effort but I think everyone's performance could have been better. Defensively we were very good today.\"\nAllardyce highlighted Swansea's performance at the Liberty Stadium, where they are unbeaten in their past six Premier League games, as well as that of Toffees keeper Jordan Pickford.\n\"We want to pass the ball better and should have done. but the fighting spirit of a team at the bottom you have to deal with,\" he continued.\n\"We held our own and it could have been a different story. I'm sure Swansea are saying they should have won it and perhaps they should but our keeper takes some beating.\"\nSeamus Coleman hit the bar for Everton late on, but the visitors' display prompted fury from their fans, who called for Allardyce to be sacked.\nThe draw keeps the Toffees ninth in the Premier League and, although the Swans drop one place to 17th, they are now five points clear of the bottom three thanks to Southampton's defeat by Chelsea.\nSwansea edge closer to survival\nSwansea were four points adrift at the bottom of the league before manager Carlos Carvalhal's appointment in December but they had moved four points above the relegation places.\nHowever, they had plateaued a little having failed to win their previous three league games - and their season's tally of 75 shots on target remained the lowest in the division.\nCarvalhal sought to address that issue with an attacking line-up which included recalls for top scorer Ayew - back from suspension - and winger Luciano Narsingh.\nTheir returns gave Swansea more pace and dynamism, helping the hosts set a fast tempo as they made a purposeful start to the game.\nAyew had a shot cleared off the line by Leighton Baines and, after Federico Fernandez's header was similarly blocked by Cenk Tosun from the corner, Ayew's clever flick set up his brother Andre for a shot which was saved by Jordan Pickford.\nIt was a busy afternoon for the Everton keeper but the longer Swansea allowed their long spells of pressure to continue without turning them into goals, the likelier it seemed they would come to rue their inability to convert their chances.\nDespite conceding against the run of play, however, the Swans kept their foot on the throttle and peppered the Everton goal until their pressure bore fruit as Ayew struck his 11th goal of the season.\nCarvalhal's men pushed for a winner and, although Huddersfield's late winner against Watford consigned the Swans to 17th in the table, this point could prove precious in their bid for survival.\nEverton fans turn on Allardyce\nWhile the spectre of relegation has all but vanished for Everton, there has been a creeping sense of discontent forming at Goodison Park.\nFans have become unhappy with the prosaic playing style under Allardyce, and there was little to quicken the pulse from his side here.\nThe visitors were fortunate not to fall behind in the first half but, at least when their first chance arrived, they took it.\nOn a rare counter-attack, Coleman's clipped cross found Yannick Bolasie unmarked at the back post and, although he and Idrissa Gueye both had shots saved by Lukasz Fabianski in quick succession, the ball bounced up and hit an unsuspecting Naughton before going in.\nIf that seemed like a false reprieve, it did not seem to fool Everton's fans, who expressed their displeasure with a string of derogatory chants about their team and manager.\nAnd once Ayew equalised, the travelling supporters turned their fury specifically towards Allardyce, calling for his sacking after yet another uninspiring display.\nMan of the match - Jordan Ayew\n'We deserved more'\nSwansea City boss Carlos Carvalhal, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We played well enough to win and we did enough to. We tried to help the players to win and made substitutions to do that.\n\"We were the better team on the pitch against an organised team who were very combative.\n\"We deserved more than what we achieved, we had a great game. We believe we'll get the points to stay up.\n\"Like all teams we were lucky and the first goal in games like this is is important.\"\nEverton boss Sam Allardyce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We've come here and got the lead and dug out a point. It was a battling point, no doubt.\n\"There are teams fighting at the bottom and Swansea showed a lot spirit.\n\"Seamus Coleman could have won it but when you get a point away from home you have to respect it in the Premier League.\n\"It's not the best performance but it moves us on. Our home form is our mainstay, we've been brilliant there this season.\"\nStats - Swansea extend unbeaten run at the Liberty Stadium\nSwansea have only lost one of their last eight Premier League meetings with Everton (W2 D5), with the Swans unbeaten in their last four at Liberty Stadium (W1 D3).\nSwansea City have conceded 13 own goals in the Premier League since 2014-15; five more than any other side.\nSince keeping two clean sheets in December, Everton have conceded in each of their last seven Premier League games on the road.\nJordan Ayew has scored in three of his last four Premier League games at Liberty Stadium, including of his last two.\nIn fact, Ayew has scored seven goals this season in the Premier League - equalling his best-ever tally from 2015-16.\nTom Carroll recorded his fourth Premier League assist of the season - double his tally from last season.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea City travel to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, 22 April (16:30 BST) before welcoming Chelsea six days later (17:30 BST).\nEverton have an eight-day wait until their next match, when they take on Newcastle United at Goodison Park on Monday, 23 April (20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth\nManager Jurgen Klopp said it is \"crazy\" the amount of goals Liverpool have scored this season after an \"exceptional\" 3-0 victory over Bournemouth took their tally up to 121 in all competitions.\nHe added that their display ended an \"outstanding week\" as Mohamed Salah scored his 30th Premier League goal to help Liverpool move to within a point of second-placed Manchester United.\nThe hosts made the perfect start when Sadio Mane followed up his own header to prod the ball past Cherries keeper Asmir Begovic.\nSalah then nonchalantly headed Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass over Begovic in the 69th minute for his 40th goal of the season in all competitions - the first player to achieve that figure for Liverpool since Ian Rush in 1986-87.\nKlopp, who described his team as playing \"like lions\", said any initial reservations over Salah - a \u00a334m signing from Roma last summer - had been dispelled.\n\"When you saw him playing in Rome there was this last question around him: if you don't play in England, you can't say yes because it is more physical.\n\"But there was a moment when we said: 'Yes, he is kind of smart and he doesn't need to look like a bodybuilder.'\"\nRoberto Firmino confirmed a fifth win in six games for the Reds with his 15th league goal of the campaign, prompting Klopp to describe their goalscoring record as \"impressive\".\nLiverpool's front three of Salah, Mane and Firmino have scored 82 goals this season, while the Reds have managed 300 goals in 148 games under Klopp.\n\"What a number. Wow! That's really good but we have to carry on - there are a few games to come,\" Klopp said.\nThe Reds beat Premier League leaders Manchester City 5-1 on aggregate to reach the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday, and the hosts were quickly into a rhythm and intensity that Bournemouth struggled to match on Saturday.\nDuring a dominant first half, the hosts created 10 goalscoring opportunities to Bournemouth's one, and by full-time Liverpool had made 618 passes to the visitors' 375.\nThe only downside of an otherwise trouble-free match for the Reds was an injury to Croatia defender Dejan Lovren, who limped off in the 83rd minute.\nBournemouth, who did not test Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius until Andrew Surman's late shot, remain 11th on 38 points.\n\"We played a very good team today - one of the best in Europe - and they are showing that,\" said Cherries manager Eddie Howe.\nKlopp hopes Lovren injury is 'not too serious'\nSalah closes on Rush record\nBefore Saturday, Julian Dicks was the last Liverpool player to score at Anfield on the day of a Grand National, in 1994, but Salah's appearance on the scoresheet against Bournemouth had an air of inevitability about it.\nThe Egypt forward has now netted eight goals in his past five games and is closing in on Liverpool's record of 47, set by Rush in 1983-84.\nHowever, while it took Rush 65 games to reach his total, Salah has currently played 20 fewer games.\nThe 25-year-old's goals and assists have earned Liverpool 15 points this term - more than any other Premier League player - and he is regarded as a strong contender for the Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year award.\nDe Bruyne or Salah? BBC pundits' verdict on PFA award\nCook's calmness\nWhile Bournemouth were overrun by a Liverpool performance brimming with energy, Lewis Cook's showing was one bright spot for the visitors.\nCook, who made his England debut in the 1-1 draw against Italy in March, exuded calmness in midfield, a sign of his growing maturity since joining the Cherries from Leeds as a 19-year-old in 2016.\nBournemouth have earned 18 points from losing positions this season - more than any other team in the Premier League - but not even Cook's best efforts could rally his team-mates into a recovery on Saturday.\nHowever, at the time of his 73rd-minute substitution, he had covered 9.16km - the second-biggest distance of any visiting player at Anfield in 2017-18.\nMan of the match - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool)\n'We have to stay angry' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on BBC Sport: \"A good performance - and a very, very, very, very important one after an outstanding week.\n\"Today it felt like a parade with people in their cars using the horn - wow. But we have to stay angry.\n\"We played Bournemouth, the rest was a few days ago and I said a few times our whole lives is Champions League qualification, so these games are all so important.\n\"We scored one but had chance after chance with really good football against a side full of confidence - good footballers, quick on the counter-attack - which makes your life really uncomfortable.\"\nFormer England and Arsenal striker Ian Wright on Match of the Day: \"The two games against Manchester City were arguably the biggest of Trent Alexander-Arnold's career and how he dealt with Leroy Sane has given him the confidence to move on.\n\"I didn't realise his distribution was as good as it is. It reminds me of when Rob Jones came on the scene.\n\"He put some great balls in. Brilliant awareness. You can see he and Mo Salah work together in training.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe on BBC Sport: \"At half-time we were in the game but their second goal came out of the blue - the ball from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah's header were unbelievable.\n\"We were kicking ourselves really because we always believed we could come back if there was one goal in it.\n\"That is the individual quality they possess. You won't see a better goal than that this weekend, a real team goal. It gave us a mountain to climb.\n\"We had chances after that, didn't take them and the third goal was unfair on us.\n\"We wanted to stay in the game and have a go at them late in the match - at 2-0 that is a lot more difficult. I was pleased there were signs we could compete but it came too late.\"\nFirst African to score 30 Premier League goals - the stats\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their past 19 Premier League home games, the longest current run in the division, and the Reds' longest run since August 2009 (31 games).\nBournemouth have enjoyed just one win in their past 11 Premier League away games, drawing six and losing four.\nMane is now the outright top scoring Senegalese player in Premier League history, netting 44 goals in the competition and eclipsing Demba Ba (43).\nOf players to have hit 10 or more goals in all of their Premier League seasons, only Sergio Aguero (seven) and Eric Cantona (five) have done it more often than Mane (four).\nSalah is the eighth different player to score 30 or more goals in a single Premier League season - he is also the first African to do so.\nSalah is also only the third different player in Liverpool history to score 40 or more goals in all competitions in a single season, after Roger Hunt (1961-62) and Ian Rush (1983-84 and 1986-87).\nFirmino has had a hand in five goals in his past five Premier League games against Bournemouth (three goals, two assists).\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool travel to the Hawthorns to face West Bromwich Albion next Saturday, 21 April (12:30 BST) while Bournemouth host Manchester United on Wednesday, 18 April (19:45 BST)."

Ilkay Gundogan converted from the spot to double City's lead.\nAgainst the run of play Christian Eriksen halved the deficit. Latching onto Harry Kane's through ball, his shot ricochet off Aymeric Laporte and then back off the Dane and in past Ederson.\nAfter the break City withstood a period of sustained pressure from Spurs, before Sterling hammered in the rebound from Jesus' shot to secure all three points in the 72nd minute.\nIt inflicted Spurs' first league defeat since losing 4-1 at City on 16 December, ending an unbeaten run of 14 matches.\nMauricio Pochettino's side stay fourth, seven points clear of Chelsea in fifth.\nReaction to City's Wembley win\nCity's deja vu\nMuch like the first-half of last weekend's Manchester derby, City were totally dominant.\nDavid Silva and Kevin De Bruyne, two nominees for the Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year award, were afforded the freedom of Wembley.\nBut Eriksen's goal sent shockwaves through the City team, with Guardiola throwing his water bottle down in frustration at his team's defensive misgivings.\nSuddenly Spurs were on the front foot and it looked like City might blow a two-goal lead for the second time in a week, after Manchester United's 3-2 comeback win in the derby.\nCity were also wasteful in front of goal, first Jesus scuffed a shot wide from 12 yards with just Lloris to beat.\nThen Sterling, who was guilty of missing two golden chances against United, skipped past the Frenchman, but with the goal at his mercy, hesitated and Ben Davies managed to block his shot.\nIn the end, the Spurs comeback never materialised and City saw out their first win in four games.\nSpurs' slow start\nTottenham started the game poorly and by the time they got into the contest, they found themselves 2-0 down.\nThey afforded so much space to City's attacking talents and were repeatedly caught out of position in defence.\nThe first-half could have been worse, Leroy Sane should have put City ahead after three minutes when he found himself in space in the box and hit the post with a volley, while Davinson Sanchez struggled at the heart of the Spurs defence.\nThey looked a different team after the break, hustling and pressing City, pinning the visitors, preventing them from playing out from the back.\nWhile Eriksen was Spurs' best attacker, Kane was subdued, offering little threat with just 18 touches in the match.\nMan of the match - Kevin De Bruyne\n'After 15 minutes I said we will be champions'\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"In the end, if we analyse the game, they fully deserve the victory.\n\"We struggled to start in the game. When we conceded the penalty, we started to play.\n\"For sure they are going to win the league, but I'm disappointed because we didn't compete in the first 25 minutes.\n\"In football you always want to compete and win. We feel that we are close but it is not enough.\n\"We still need to improve to reach the last level which is the most difficult thing.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"I said to my staff after 10-15 minutes 'After today we will be champions.' After the last week to come here and play like we did, we will be champions.\n\"In the past with [defeats by] Manchester United and Liverpool, maybe it was not easy for the players but we were good and we created chances in the second half to score more goals and we're so happy.\n\"We will try hard to be champions in front of our fans at the Etihad Stadium.\"\nStats - Sterling's goal spree\nThis was City's 14th away win in the Premier League this season - the only side to have won more in a single campaign is Chelsea in 2004-05 (15).\nPrior to the game, Spurs hadn't lost a Premier League home game by a margin of two or more goals since August 2014 (0-3 v Liverpool).\nSterling scored his 22nd goal of the season for Manchester City, which is at least twice as many as he's registered in any of his previous seasons in all competitions (11 in 2014-15 and 2015-16).\nEriksen has netted in each of his past four games for Tottenham in all competitions (five goals); his longest scoring streak for Spurs.\nJesus has been directly involved in 27 goals in 34 starts in all competitions for Manchester City (20 goals and seven assists).\nGuardiola's side are one of four clubs to have won away at all three of Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs in the same Premier League campaign (alongside Coventry in 1993-94, Charlton in 2001-02 and Blackburn in 2002-03).\nTottenham conceded a goal from the penalty spot in the Premier League for the first time in 59 games, last conceding against West Ham in November 2016.\nWhat's next?\nCity host Swansea on 22 April (16:30 BST), when they will definitely wrap up the title with a win.

We have to be realistic. We came out of it with no points and overall we thought we should have got three points.\"\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, playing for the first time together, had linked up for Arsenal's opener in the 14th minute.\nThe Gabon striker received Shkodran Mustafi's chip and clipped the ball to the far post for the arriving Lacazette to slide in and score.\nAyoze Perez equalised just before the half-hour mark, running in past Shkodran Mustafi, to guide in DeAndre Yedlin's cross at the near post.\nCalum Chambers should have put Arsenal back in front towards the end of the half, but he pushed an attempt wide as he slid in to meet Mustafi's header.\nIt took until the 67th minute for either side to have a shot in the second half, with Ritchie then getting the winner a minute later.\nNacho Monreal failed to clear the ball and substitute Islam Slimani's header was flicked on by Perez into the path of Ritchie, who coolly steered his shot past goalkeeper Petr Cech.\nKenedy almost made it three, his shot looping up and hitting the bar.\nThere were some nervy moments in the closing stages as Arsenal pressed for an equaliser, but Newcastle held on for a vital win, their fourth straight league victory.\nIt puts them on 41 points with five games remaining, 13 clear of relegation.\nWenger laments Premier League's 'very bad' VAR decision\nReaction from St James' Park\nArsenal's away-day blues\nThis was another dire away performance from Arsenal, for whom the only way to save their season will be by winning the Europa League to secure automatic Champions League qualification.\nBut they face a semi-final against Atletico Madrid, who are second in La Liga, and based on this display at St James' Park, victory will be a tall order.\nArsene Wenger gave a Premier League debut to 18-year-old midfielder Joe Willock, while Hector Bellerin was not in the squad.\nDespite resting a few players, Arsenal did field their two most expensive signings in a strikeforce with a combined value of \u00a3102.5m, as Lacazette partnered Aubameyang.\nEarly signs looked good, but they were let down by defensive mistakes, with a back four that was there for the taking.\nThe Gunners barely threatened after Newcastle went ahead, failing to register a shot on target in the final 45 minutes.\nDefeat means they have now:\nLost five successive away games in the league for the first time since December 1984.\nLost 11 Premier League games this season; equalling their worst tally of league defeats in a season under Wenger (11 in 2005-06).\nConceded 45 goals in the league this season - one more than in the whole of 2016-17 (44) - only in 2011-12 (49) have they conceded more under Wenger in a league campaign.\nThey stay in sixth place on 54 points, 33 points behind leaders Manchester City (87 points) and the same number away from bottom club West Brom (21 points).\nSpeaking about their away record, Wenger said: \"It's a lot about the head and sometimes there is no rationality in it. It doesn't make sense.\"\nNewcastle reach magic number\nThe 40-point mark is the magic number supposedly needed to guarantee Premier League survival and the Magpies have now passed that.\nGiven the uncertainty over the club's ownership and the lack of funds available to manager Rafael Benitez, Newcastle's move towards survival is one of the stories of the league this season.\nThey have also ended a wretched run against Arsenal, having lost their previous 10 Premier League meetings with Wenger's side.\n\"I think we are safe with 41 points,\" said Benitez. \"It's a massive achievement for the players, the city and the fans. I want to congratulate everyone.\n\"Today we didn't play amazing football because we played an amazing team but you have to manage how you play and compete for the win.\"\nAfter weathering Arsenal's early attacking spell, the Magpies grew into the game and the excellent Jonjo Shelvey dictated play, while Perez was tireless in the lone striker role.\nWith the game petering out in the second half, the introduction of Slimani, making just his second appearance following his loan move from Leicester, lifted Newcastle and they were good value for the win.\nMohamed Diame was a rock in the centre of midfield, making crucial tackles and covering more than 11km, while captain Jamaal Lascelles made vital clearances as he repelled Arsenal's limited attacks.\nMan of the match - Jonjo Shelvey\nStats - Arsenal's youth factory\nLacazette's opening goal was the 100th that Arsenal have scored in all competitions this season - they became the fourth Premier League club to reach this landmark in 2017-18 (after Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur).\nAll seven of Matt Ritchie's Premier League goals have come in home games (four for Bournemouth, three for Newcastle). Only four players have more Premier League goals without scoring away from home (Georginio Wijnaldum, Clive Wilson, Ronny Johnsen and Jeff Kenna).\nJoe Willock (born in August 1999) was just the fourth player who was born after Arsene Wenger's first match in charge to make a Premier League appearance for Arsenal (Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah are the others).\nWillock was the 56th teenager to make a Premier League appearance for Arsenal - the most of any Premier League team - six more than Chelsea and Manchester United (50 each).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal host West Ham in the league on Sunday (13:30 BST), while Newcastle travel to Everton on 23 April (20:00)."

We were a complicated team and let them feel comfortable.\"\nUnited's best chance of the game was a Romelu Lukaku header, which was superbly saved by Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster.\nTransfers, tactics and a text message - how Guardiola turned City into champions\n'City have raised expectations of how to win the title'\nCity manager Pep Guardiola had claimed he would be on the golf course on Sunday afternoon and would not watch the game.\nThe win was West Brom's first since a 2-0 success over Brighton on 12 January and only their fourth all season.\nHowever, Premier League survival still looks unlikely for the Baggies, who are nine points adrift of 17th-placed Swansea with four matches remaining.\nMan Utd leave the handbrake on\nLast weekend saw United complete a stunning comeback victory over City as they came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Etihad Stadium.\nIn that match, Mourinho's side produced a poor first-half display before they rallied to deny City what would have been the sweetest of coronations as champions.\nUnited should have been surfing the crest of the wave following that victory, but instead they fell flat against West Brom.\nWith the exception of the chance for Lukaku - and a penalty appeal when Ander Herrera was caught by Craig Dawson - it was a soporific first half for the home fans.\n\"Attack, attack, attack\" was the call from the Stretford End after the break and while United were more purposeful with the directness of Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial, they could not find an equaliser.\nIt is hard to imagine United would have approached a home game against the bottom club, particularly in the first half, in such a way under Sir Alex Ferguson's management.\nIn situations such as these - with United being second in the table - Ferguson may have trusted his players to play with more freedom and blow West Brom away, which begs the question of whether Mourinho has the same faith in his squad to deliver.\nAfterwards, Mourinho indicated that his players did not execute the game plan as he had hoped.\n\"Everything was slow, one more flick, trick, turn. There was no fluidity,\" he said.\nPerhaps the only comfort for United supporters is that City were denied the kind of thrilling champagne moment that fans crave.\nInstead, the title was decided on a wet Sunday afternoon when the new champions were not playing. It is hard to imagine City's players and Guardiola being too bothered by that, though.\nMoore enhances his credentials\nCaretaker boss Darren Moore is a popular figure at Albion and has quickly introduced the kind of togetherness and organisation so stark by its absence under Alan Pardew, who was sacked at the beginning of the month.\nThe Albion board may want a more experienced hand at the tiller next season, while the fans will probably crave a bigger name in management terms.\nHowever, Moore has done his reputation no harm whatsoever as his players produced a performance which married commitment with tactical discipline.\nWhen asked if he wanted to be the next Albion boss, Moore said he was \"just focusing on the team and performances\".\nWest Brom 'pulling in same direction' for Moore - McClean\nWest Brom finished with their backs to the wall but had chances of their own, and Jake Livermore had earlier tested David De Gea with arguably the best opportunity before the break.\nThis was West Brom's first league away win in 16 attempts and ended a 12-match streak without a victory - a run which included 11 straight defeats.\nIt also emphasises how misguided the appointment of Pardew now appears.\nIf Moore was able to coax such a performance out of these players, then what could he, or an alternative choice, have done with more time?\nAnother miserable day for Pogba\nPaul Pogba's two goals against City felt like a defining moment for the France midfielder during a season which has had more downs than ups.\nHowever, United's record \u00a389m signing followed it up with a underwhelming display on the left of midfield in a 4-3-3 system.\nPogba was substituted by Mourinho in the 58th minute and the player departed proceedings with an air of resignation rather than annoyance at the decision.\nIt will inevitably lead to more questions over whether Pogba and United are such a good fit, given the sense he has yet to fully display his ability on a consistent basis.\nMourinho was asked whether he took off Pogba because he had a yellow card and was at risk of getting sent off.\nThe Portuguese gave a cryptic one-word response: \"Also.\"\nMan of the match - Ben Foster (West Brom)\n'The players expressed themselves' - what they said\nWest Brom caretaker boss Darren Moore: \"We played against a really formidable team today, asked a lot of questions, but everyone worked hard and did their jobs.\n\"I'm proud for players and staff and way they have acquitted themselves today.\n\"I want the players to express themselves, show the outside world what good players they are. I am pleased we managed to show everyone that.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"I won eight titles and I am not on the moon because I won against Manchester City.\n\"I saw lots of people on the moon because we won against City. You could see the difference in the attitude to players compared to last week.\n\"We deserve to be punished, but the defeat was too heavy.\"\nOld Trafford's title record - the stats\nThis was the fifth season in which the Premier League title was decided at Old Trafford - more than any other ground in the competition.\nWest Brom have lost one of their past five Premier League visits to Old Trafford (W3 D1 L1)\nThis was just the second time in Premier League history that United have lost at home to a side starting that day as the bottom club.\nDarren Moore has taken two matches to equal Alan Pardew's total number of Premier League wins (one in 18 games) as West Brom manager.\nMoore has led Albion to four points in his two games as caretaker boss - the same tally of points Alan Pardew secured in his final 11 league games in charge.\nJay Rodriguez has scored three goals in his past four Premier League appearances - as many as he did in his previous 26 combined.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United visit Bournemouth in the Premier League for a 19:45 BST kick-off on Wednesday. They then have an FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham at Wembley on Saturday (17:15). West Brom host in-form Liverpool in Saturday's early Premier League match (12:30)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-1 Stoke City\nStoke City boss Paul Lambert said he \"can't ask for any more effort\" from his players after Andy Carroll's dramatic late equaliser for West Ham took the Potters closer to relegation.\nThe Hammers are now seven points clear of the relegation zone, with Stoke five points adrift of safety with four games left.\nStoke looked set for a first win in 10 games when Peter Crouch took advantage of Joe Hart's fumble to score.\nBut fellow substitute Carroll, in his first appearance since January, volleyed home a last-minute equaliser from Aaron Cresswell's cross.\nDespite only winning the first of his 11 games in charge since replacing the sacked Mark Hughes in January, Lambert thinks his side would be certainties to stay up if they had played like this for the whole of the campaign.\n\"If the team had been playing like that at the start of the season, I wouldn't be here - and they wouldn't be in the position they're in,\" he said.\n\"I still think we need three wins. If we can get a little break on Sunday against Burnley, we're certainly in with a fight.\"\nThe Hammers thought they had won the game when Javier Hernandez scored in injury time, but it was disallowed for a Carroll handball in the build-up.\nIt was the third goal they had ruled out in the game. On the first occasion, Marko Arnautovic was offside when he headed home - and then he was interfering with play from Edimilson Fernandes' shot.\nAll three decisions were correct calls by referee Michael Oliver, following a difficult few days in which he and his wife have been abused after he awarded Real Madrid a last-minute penalty against Juventus and sent off Gianluigi Buffon in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nWith both sides' Premier League places in jeopardy, it was a hotly contested game for the official to deal with - the match produced 36 fouls, the joint-highest in a Premier League game this season.\n\"I think he is a really top referee,\" said Lambert. \"He got unfairly criticised from a lot of quarters. He had a good game today.\"\nIs Stoke's 10-year Premier League stay coming to an end?\nStoke City felt they were unlucky in recent defeats by Arsenal and Tottenham, and manager Lambert said before the game they had to get \"something\" at London Stadium. But this will feel like another loss, having come so close to only a second win in his reign.\nThey did not have too many clear goalscoring chances with Ramadan Sobhi, Moritz Bauer and Mame Biram Diouf all producing straightforward saves from Joe Hart in the first half.\nStoke's best chance - bar the goal - came moments after Arnautovic's disallowed goal when Diouf blazed over from six yards out.\nLambert had to be brave and he was when he brought on 37-year-old Crouch for Bauer, who was playing in midfield but is usually a defender.\nIt looked as if it had paid off in some style when Hart spilled Xherdan Shaqiri's shot and Crouch turned in from close range.\nStoke have been in the Premier League for 10 years - and Crouch's goal made him the Potters' top scorer in that spell, with strike number 44 taking him past Jon Walters.\nBut unless they have a turnaround in fortune in the final four games, he will not have many more chances to extend that record.\nHas Carroll saved West Ham?\nWest Ham are now seven points above the relegation zone - it would have been four but for Carroll's late intervention.\nJust as Lambert gambled to bring on Crouch, Hammers boss David Moyes did the same when he introduced the England striker, who had not played since January because of an ankle injury, in the 86th minute.\nFour minutes later, the 29-year-old was celebrating an excellent equaliser as he swung a boot at Cresswell's cross from near the penalty spot.\nAll of the Hammers' three disallowed goals seemed fair decisions. Arnautovic, a former Potters player, was just offside when he headed in Cresswell's shot.\nHe was then standing in Jack Butland's eyeline when Fernandes scored from distance. And Carroll did appear to control the ball with his arm before laying it off to fellow substitute Hernandez.\n'We bossed the majority of the game'\nWest Ham are now on 35 points, and Moyes is setting a target of 40 for survival.\n\"We certainly didn't deserve to lose,\" he said. \"If we did, the football gods really would be against us. We bossed the majority of the game. In the main, we played well and were on top when they got their goal.\n\"I'm pleased we have got people off the bench who can make a difference - we've not always had the depth this season. I thought Javier Hernandez and Manuel Lanzini helped, all the players have played well.\n\"Joe Hart faced a few similar shots in the first half and he gathered them easily, so it is unfortunate that one bounced up and caught him out [for Crouch's goal]. Up until then we hadn't been threatened a whole lot.\n\"You always think 40 points is safe. A lot of clubs look like they will not be able to get that, hopefully we do as soon as we can.\"\n'Tonight will cement the loss of Stoke's Premier League status'\nBBC Radio 5 live's Chris Sutton, former Blackburn and Celtic striker\nDavid Moyes has done a good, steady job at West Ham. You only have to look at what he took on. They just have to get to the end of the season and however they stay up - by a goal or whatever - write this season off and go again. He should be given the opportunity to go again next season.\nTheir injury list has been unprecedented this season. They have been patched up, scrapping and scrambling. Staying in the Premier League would be a triumph.\nIt may have been a risk putting Andy Carroll on the bench, he has been out 13 games. It showed it was the right call. A fit Carroll is a handful for most defences. There were brave calls from both managers, but they both got them right.\nPaul Lambert will be despairing. What an opportunity - ahead in the last few minutes. It is two points lost and I think tonight will cement the loss of their Premier League status.\nMan of the match - Aaron Cresswell (West Ham)\nPost-match stats - Stoke's London woes\nWest Ham have lost only one of their past seven home games in the Premier League (W3 D3), having lost three of the six before that (W1 D2)\nStoke are without a win on their last 19 Premier League visits to London, drawing seven and losing 12.\nThe 36 fouls is the joint-highest tally in a Premier League game this season with Chelsea v Man Utd on 5 November.\nCrouch is now on 16 substitute goals in the Premier League (level with Javier Hernandez); only four players have more (Defoe 24, Giroud 19, Kanu 17 and Solskjaer 17).\nAndy Carroll has scored three goals in his last three Premier League appearances.\nWhat's next?\nStoke City are at home to Europa League-chasing Burnley on Sunday (13:30 BST), while West Ham visit Arsenal at the same time.\nWhere next?\nListen: Some Stoke players have 'downed tools'\nEngland should not take Hart to World Cup - Sutton\nRelive the action as it happened"

We have three massive games left and we need to get over the line,\" said Howe, whose side have beaten Arsenal and Chelsea in 2018.\nOn another day, Callum Wilson might have won a penalty.

We are looking to get maximum points from every game now.\n\"The players are a little bit flat and we have got a big game at the weekend but we are not in the situation where we are downhearted.\"\nSouthampton's next Premier League match is on 28 April when they host Bournemouth - one of four remaining games of the season.\nSaints miss chance to close the gap\nSouthampton looked short of ideas and low on confidence as they were forced to settle for a draw in a performance symptomatic of a team fighting to get out of the bottom three.\nIt took until the 18th minute for the visitors to have a tame shot on goal and they recorded just one touch in Leicester's box before the half-hour mark.\nAnd when Long fluffed his attempted cut-back just moments before the half-time whistle, manager Hughes thrust his arms into the air in frustration and turned back to the bench with a huff.\nThere was a slight improvement towards the end of the first half - Ryan Bertrand and Cedric Soares had promising efforts on goal - but it was still a timid end to a fairly lacklustre opening 45 minutes.\nSouthampton showed more intensity in the second half and should have taken the lead when Long's poke from close range was blocked by goalkeeper Ben Hamer.\nBut in the end they had to settle for a draw which is not the result Southampton would have hoped for in their quest to avoid relegation for the first time since 2012.\nThe Saints have recorded just one league victory in their last 21 games - against bottom club West Brom - and they missed a chance to pick up all three points against a comfortable Leicester side who had the freedom to experiment slightly.\nSouthampton can enjoy the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday, which is a rare opportunity for fans to be optimistic, but their future in the Premier League looks to be coming to an end.\nThey have four games remaining to pick up as many points as possible but with champions Manchester City visiting on the final day, Southampton's hopes look slim.\nPuel experiments with personnel\nLeicester's performance epitomised that of a team comfortably in mid-table and with little to play for as the season reaches its conclusion.\nEx-Saints manager Claude Puel used the game as an opportunity to test out new formations and partnerships ahead of next season.\nMarc Albrighton played on the right of a back four in a 4-4-1-1 formation but was still able to present a threat with his delivery - providing several chances for Vardy in the second half.\nAnd Vardy also linked up well with Iheanacho - who made his fourth start of the season - creating chances during a bright spell when they dominated in the first half.\nBut aside from a few tweaks, it was a relatively forgettable performance from Leicester as they rarely peppered Southampton's goal in a match which lacked quality.\nAnother goalless draw - the best of the stats\nThis was the 27th 0-0 draw in the Premier League this season, equalling the tally from 2016-17 (27) but with four matchdays remaining.\nSouthampton have been involved in five of these goalless draws in 2017-18; more than any other side.\nThe Saints didn't attempt a single shot on target until the 57th minute of this match. They only attempted one more in the game, and that came in the 90th minute.\nLeicester have collected 44 points this season, level with their points tally in the whole of 2016-17.\nSouthampton (29 points) need three points from their remaining four league games of the season to even match their worst-ever points tally in a Premier League season (32 in 2004-05, when they finished bottom).\nAfter winning the 2015-16 Premier League title with 23 wins to their name, Leicester City have won the exact same number of matches (23) in 72 games since August 2016.\nWilfred Ndidi made six tackles in this match; double the number of any other player. Overall this season, he's made the most tackles in the competition (135); 29 more than any other player.\n'Only time will tell' - what the managers said\nLeicester manager Claude Puel: \"We are a little bit disappointed not to win but I'm happy with our performance. It was important to continue the momentum from the second half against Burnley and I think we did that.\n\"We showed a lot of quality and had two or three good chances to score in the first half and we played with a good tempo and intensity. If we can repeat this performance in the next game against Crystal Palace we will do well.\n\"Kasper (Schmeichel) will play the next game, it was not a big injury but I'm happy with Ben Hamer's performance and he made a good save in the first half.\"\nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes speaking to BBC Sport: \"We hoped to get more out of the game and we had a couple of chances. Their keeper made a good save against Shane Long but we were up against a good side and we had to stay in the game. Clearly we would have liked to have been more expansive but we got a point, and we play at home next which is huge for us.\n\"Only time will tell to see whether the point is enough for us. There was a little bit of apprehension in our play. The players are a little bit flat and we have got a big game at the weekend but we are not in the situation where we are downhearted.\n\"It's the disappointment of not getting maximum points, but the key was to get something from the game. Tonight we probably didn't play as well as in recent weeks but we took something from the game.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester's next match isn't until Saturday, 28 April when they travel to Crystal Palace (15:00 BST).\nSouthampton take on Chelsea in the semi-finals of the FA Cup on Sunday (15:00 BST) before returning to league action on Saturday, 28 April when they host Bournemouth (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 2-2 Liverpool\nWest Brom produced a \"useless comeback\" by scoring two late goals to take a point at the Hawthorns, says Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\nThe hosts were 2-0 down after 79 minutes - Danny Ings and Mohamed Salah on target for the Reds - before goals from Jake Livermore and Salomon Rondon.\nHowever the Baggies will be relegated on Sunday if Swansea beat Manchester City.\n\"I don't think that point will help West Brom massively, it is a complete waste of points. They don't need it, we would have needed it,\" Klopp added.\n\"They are happy now, we are not happy. We stay in the league, they don't stay in the league - it is a strange situation.\"\nThe German also criticised the Hawthorns' \"dry pitch\" after the draw.\nThe hosts' comeback started when Livermore scrambled home at a corner for his first goal at the club before Rondon headed in Chris Brunt's free-kick in the 88th minute.\nSalah had earlier continued his brilliant form with a chipped second-half finish which takes him to 31 Premier League goals this season and sees him equal the record for a 38-game campaign.\nLiverpool, who made five changes to their starting line-up with their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday in mind, were ahead after just four minutes through Ings.\nThe Englishman, who was making just his second start under Jurgen Klopp, stroked home from six yards for his first goal since October 2015.\nThe draw ensures West Brom caretaker manager Darren Moore extends his unbeaten start in charge, but his side remain bottom, eight points from safety with three games left.\nReaction to Saturday's thriller at The Hawthorns\nMoore's Baggies continue to show fight\nWest Brom have been hapless for much of the season, winning just one point in 18 games during Alan Pardew's four months in charge, but in the past two games they have shown plenty of spirit against two of the league's best teams.\nThey beat Manchester United last weekend and have now followed that with another morale-boosting showing against Liverpool.\nThe Baggies battled throughout the game and caused Liverpool problems, particularly with crosses into the box, but when Salah added Liverpool's second in 72nd minute, most in the ground believed the result was sealed.\n\"We're really delighted,\" Moore said. \"Another positive result and solid performance against a very good team.\n\"Today we've earned that result. The support, players and staff have all come together.\n\"The big thing for me is the togetherness.\"\nDespite the comeback, however, there seemed to be a feeling of proud resignation at full-time: the crowd applauded but were not celebratory and Rondon crouched to his knees.\nThey are still two points below 19th-placed Stoke and eight adrift of Swansea in 17th who have played two games fewer.\n\"I will only look to the game ahead,\" Moore said. \"This game was a massive hurdle and to come out with a positive performance and a point, we will see what happens this weekend.\"\nBy adding another draw to the win and a draw in his first two games in charge, Moore has at least further strengthened his claim for the job on a permanent basis regardless of which division West Brom are playing in next season.\nHowever, when asked about his future at full-time Moore was again non-committal, saying \"it is about the next game\".\nLate lapses cost changed Liverpool\nIt looked like Liverpool were on course to collect three points despite Klopp resting forward Roberto Firmino, midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dejan Lovren and Andrew Robertson.\nBut despite taking the lead, with Joe Gomez, Ragnar Klavan and Alberto Moreno recalled in defence, Liverpool always looked shaky at the back.\nWest Brom did not create much from open play but they often caused trouble at set pieces and it was defending at a free-kick and a corner which cost the Reds the win.\nBut Klopp will still be pleased that they completed the game without any injury scares and they remain eight points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea.\nSalah's 31st league goal took him alongside Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez, who share the record for a 38-game season.\nAnd Ings, who has recovered from two serious knee injuries, scored his first goal in 930 days and he celebrated his early strike with plenty of emotion.\n\"It has been a long time,\" Ings said. \"I've had to climb a huge mountain to get into this position. But I would have sacrificed that for three points.\"\nIngs was also involved in an incident with West Brom's Ahmed Hegazi when the Egyptian appeared to punch the striker, albeit with little force.\nKlopp criticises Hawthorns pitch\nKlopp also described the match as a \"difficult game\" because of the \"dry pitch\" at the Hawthorns.\n\"West Brom decided not to water the pitch at half-time and that makes it difficult,\" the German said.\n\"It makes a massive difference. A team like West Brom do not need a wet pitch, they can do it next year playing on a dry pitch in the Championship.\"\nMoore responded to those comments by saying the pitch \"was not a tactic\" and was \"the same for both teams\".\n\"It was a hot afternoon - we watered the pitch before the game,\" said Moore. \"The heat has dried out the pitch.\"\nMan of the match - Matt Phillips\nThe best stats\nWest Brom avoided defeat in a Premier League game in which they were two goals down for the first time since February 2015.\nSalomon Rondon has equalled the record for most Premier League games scored in a single season without winning any of them [seven, level with Jordan Ayew in 2015-16].\nSalah is just the fifth player in Premier League history to register more than 40 goal involvements in a single season [31 goals, nine assists] - also Alan Shearer [47 in 1994-95], Andrew Cole [47 in 1993-94], Thierry Henry [44 in 2002-03] and Luis Suarez [43 in 2013-14].\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been directly involved in 10 Premier League goals this season, (three goals, seven assists), his best-ever haul in the competition. Oxlade-Chamberlain has provided more Premier League assists for Salah [five] than he has for any other player in the competition.\nJake Livermore scored his first goal for West Brom in what was his 50th appearance in all competitions.\nChris Brunt has provided 50 assists for West Brom in the Premier League, 26 more than any other player [James Morrison on 24]. He is the first Northern Ireland player to reach this feat in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom travel to Newcastle next Saturday (15:00 BST) while Liverpool follow their European exploits with a home game against Stoke earlier the same day.

Some were enforced, while others were made with the Europa League in mind.\nRecord signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang started on the bench and Petr Cech missed out with a hip injury.\nMesut Ozil missed the game with illness, while Jack Wilshere and Sead Kolasinac had ankle injuries.\nDespite Wenger's impending departure, the Emirates lacked a celebratory mood as the teams came out. There were empty seats, no fanfare and the Frenchman snuck into his dugout.\nThe first half gave Arsenal fans little to cheer about as the visitors dominated the early exchanges.\nGranit Xhaka had their only shot on target as his free-kick stung the palms of Hart, while Danny Welbeck wasted a number of chances.\nShkodran Mustafi struggled in defence against Arnautovic and there were warning signs ahead of a meeting with one of the world's best strikers in Atletico's Antoine Griezmann.\nDespite deservedly taking the lead after half-time, their defensive frailties were exposed again for the equaliser.\nThe introduction of Aubameyang in the 70th minute lifted the team and the fans.\nHart was twice forced into action, first by Xhaka and then by Welbeck, before Ramsey's goal started a late flourish as Arsenal finished in style.\nHammers unravel\nThe Hammers, unchanged from their 1-1 draw with Stoke on Monday, caused Arsenal plenty of problems in the first half and they looked in the mood to ruin Wenger's long farewell.\nOspina saved from Arnautovic while Cheikhou Kouyate hit the bar with a header but, after the 21st minute, they did not have another chance until the hour mark.\nThey were second best after the break, though they were briefly lifted by the introductions of Javier Hernandez and Manuel Lanzini, who helped force the equaliser.\nEngland keeper Hart, who is fighting for a place at the World Cup, had played well in the game with some crucial stops, until he was undone by Rice's indecision, while he could have done better with Lacazette's first.\nDespite the heavy defeat, West Ham will be buoyed by Stoke's draw with Burnley which gives them breathing space in their battle to avoid relegation.\nMan of the match - Aaron Ramsey\n'A good way to prepare' - what they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"I was focused on winning the game. We just tried to be professional and do our job even when the circumstances are different. It was a good team spirit and good preparation for Thursday.\n\"I think we constructed patiently. We didn't make big mistakes. First of all before winning a trophy, you need to get through the semi-finals. This is a good way to prepare - scoring goals against a strong West Ham team who have done well recently.\"\nWest Ham manager David Moyes: \"It [Wenger's announcement] did make it more difficult but I didn't think it played that way. We did a really good job and contained them for long periods.\n\"We just didn't start the second half as well and they got a foothold in the game. We came back into it but in the end we probably had too many attacking players on the pitch and ruined our balance of making sure we did the defensive job well.\n\"Great credit to the lads for how well they stuck at it. Unfortunately a young player [Declan Rice] makes a mistake - but that's how you learn, make mistakes and get on with it and hopefully come back better.\"\nMoyes' Wenger curse - stats\nArsenal have won six consecutive home matches in all competitions, netting at least three goals in each victory (20 goals in total).\nWenger has beaten Moyes in 22 matches in all competitions - more than any another manager during his time as Arsenal boss.\nMoyes is winless in all 18 of his away matches against Arsenal in all competitions (D4 L14).\nThe last three occasions that West Ham have conceded four second-half goals in a Premier League game have been against Arsenal (January 2013, December 2016 and today).\nMonreal has scored three goals in his last seven Premier League appearances - as many as he had in his first 153 appearances in the competition.\nRamsey has been involved in more goals in all competitions than any other Arsenal player this season (19, 11 goals, eight assists).\nArnautovic has had a hand in 14 goals in his last 16 Premier League appearances (10 goals, four assists).\n80% of Lacazette's goals for Arsenal this season have come at the Emirates (12 of 15).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal's focus switches to Thursday's Europa League semi-final as they host Atletico Madrid (20:05 BST) in the first leg at the Emirates. That is followed by a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Sunday (16:30 BST).\nWest Ham's next game is against the Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday (14:15 BST) at London Stadium."

We have to go to Anfield and get a point. There's still a lot of twists and turns here.\n\"One thing you ask is to give it everything you've got. Since I've been here they have - there's been misfortune.\"\nOn Sunday, that bad luck amounted to Mame Biram Diouf spurning a glorious opportunity to double Stoke's advantage, and Lambert appeared to console the forward as he left the pitch at the end of the first half.\nHe said: \"If we score the second with Diouf's chance, it's hard for Burnley to come back. But it was never enough. We had some big moments.\n\"It's important the players see I'm right behind them. The one thing about Diouf is he gives you everything.\"\nBurnley struggled as an attacking force early on but responded after the break, with Barnes touching the ball beyond home goalkeeper Jack Butland with his thigh.\nAnd while Stephen Ireland clipped the outside of the post for the host late on, Sean Dyche's team also created several chances to reinforce their grip on seventh in the table.\nStoke's England goalkeeper, Jack Butland made a string of saves though to prevent Jack Cork, James Tarkowski and Johann Berg Gudmundsson from scoring which limited the damage on a disappointing day.\nPerformances but not enough points\nGood performances have not necessarily materialised into points recently for Stoke, who ran Tottenham close before losing 2-1 on 7 April, and then conceded a 90th-minute equaliser at West Ham on Monday.\nThat result left Lambert setting his team a target of winning three of their remaining four Premier League games.\nHis players initially delivered a performance that suggested they had been galvanised by their manager's call.\nMidfield pair Joe Allen and Ndiaye typified a first-half performance brimming with industry and passion.\nHowever, Diouf's failure to convert an excellent chance just before the break proved pivotal.\n\"It probably looked as bad from where you were sitting as it did from where I was standing,\" Lambert added.\n\"If that ball had come to him when he was more confident in the game, he'd have probably hit it first time. But I'm not going to criticise him because he's been excellent for me.\"\nBurnley respond after slow start\nDevoid of attacking thrust for much of the first half - registering just two shots on target - Burnley ramped up their efforts after the break.\n\"I reminded the players at half-time of how tight it was, that we just had to raise a few things,\" Dyche said.\n\"Second half, we gave a good performance; we were worthy of at least a draw.\"\nA point was secured after a change a change in tactics and intensity, as Dyche's side shortened their game and got the ball wide, instead of knocking long balls in the direction of Barnes and Chris Wood,\nIcelandic winger Gudmundsson suddenly came to the fore and the Clarets carved out a succession of opportunities before Barnes grabbed a merited equaliser.\nIf Gudmundsson had converted any of three efforts on goal within a 90-second spell before the final whistle, it would have brought a fourth consecutive top-flight away win for the first time since September 1961.\nHowever, Dyche's team still look likely candidates for European football next term, for the first since 1966-67.\nThey are nine points clear of eighth-placed Leicester, and look set to qualify for the Europa League barring an unlikely sequence of results.\nMan of the match - Joe Allen (Stoke City)\nStoke's winless run - the key stats\nStoke have gone 11 league games without a win (D6 L5), their joint-longest run without a victory in the Premier League, equalling a record set between April and September 2012.\nPaul Lambert has failed to win all of his five league meetings with Burnley as a manager (D3 L2). Only against Everton (eight) and Manchester United (seven) has he taken charge of more games in the top four tiers of English football without earning a victory.\nBurnley have lost only two of the past seven Premier League games in which they have conceded the first goal (W2 D3), having lost each of the seven beforehand.\nThe Clarets have kept one clean sheet in 15 league games in 2018; only Brighton (none) have kept fewer in the Premier League this calendar year so far.\nBadou Ndiaye is the fourth different Senegalese player to score for Stoke City in the Premier League (also Abdoulaye Faye, Salif Diao and Mame Biram Diouf). Only Newcastle United (six) have had more.\nIndeed, Ndiaye was the ninth different player from Senegal to score a Premier League goal this season, the most number of different scorers the nation has had in any season in the competition (previously eight in 2016-17).\nAshley Barnes has scored six goals in his past eight league games, as many as in his previous 44 appearances.\nWhat's next?\nStoke City travel to Anfield next Saturday to face Champions League semi-finalists Liverpool (12:30 BST) while Burnley welcome Brighton & Hove Albion to Turf Moor (15:00 BST) on the same day."

If we are improving it will be good for the new season, finishing in a good way.\"\nRaheem Sterling's cut-back set up David Silva's early opener before the winger poked in from six yards to make it two within 16 minutes.\nKevin de Bruyne scored with a sensational 25-yard drive before Bernardo Silva pounced on the rebound of Gabriel Jesus' saved penalty.\nThe Brazilian eventually found the back of the net when he headed in Yaya Toure's chipped pass.\nSwansea are without a win in five league matches and remain four points above the relegation zone with four games to play.\nAnd the Swans must take on fifth-placed Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium next week before hosting relegation-threatened Stoke and Southampton in a tough run-in.\nManchester City can look forward to their penultimate home game of the season against Huddersfield on 6 May, when they will be presented with the Premier League trophy.\nChampions' guard of honour and pitch celebrations\nIt was a day of celebrations for Manchester City, who were crowned Premier League champions last week following Manchester United's defeat by West Brom.\nSupporters gathered at Etihad Stadium before kick-off to parade replica trophies, fly flags and welcome the champions on arrival.\nThey also stormed the pitch in numbers to celebrate at full-time - singing, taking pictures and setting off flares to revel in Manchester City's third Premier League title.\nAnd Guardiola's side were applauded by the Swansea players and staff in a guard of honour before kick-off.\nThe hosts' performance was worthy of a title-winning side, too.\nThey cut Swansea's defence apart in the opening stages and passed the ball around with flair and creativity.\nIt was a display of intent from the champions, and while they can still break Premier League records before the season ends in May, they are also chasing individual and club accolades.\nManchester City have now also broken their own record tally of 89, set in 2011-12, and Guardiola could beat his previous best points tally in a single league season as a manager - 99, with Barcelona in 2009-10.\nNo team has accrued 100 points or more in a single top-flight campaign, but City would become the first that if they pick up 10 from their remaining four games.\nRecords Manchester City can still break:\nMost points (previous record - 95 set by Chelsea in 2004-05)\nMost wins (previous record - 30 set by Chelsea in 2016-17)\nMost goals (previous record - 103 set by Chelsea in 2009-10)\nBiggest title-winning margin (previous record - 18 points set by Manchester United in 1999-00)\nSwansea's continuing relegation battle\nCarlos Carvalhal's Swansea have improved dramatically since December, but they still remain in a relegation battle.\nThey currently sit four points above the drop zone - though they would not have expected to pick up points at the Etihad.\nBut with four games to go, including a tough match against FA Cup finalists Chelsea to come next week, the Swans cannot yet feel that their survival is guaranteed.\nThey have lost only four times in their last 14 Premier League matches, though, a record that will give them confidence heading into those crucial games against Stoke and Southampton.\nAnd though there were not too many positives to take from their performance in Manchester, they were simply outclassed by the best side in the country this season.\nAlfie Mawson came close with a headed effort in the second half, but there was not too much to get excited about for the Swans and their attentions will have already turned to their remaining four games.\n'We have to keep improving' - what the managers said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"It was a happy atmosphere around the stadium, getting off the bus and of course the supporters. The most important thing was a good performance.\n\"You have to keep improving. We spoke to the players in the week about that. If we are improving it will be good for the new season, finishing in a good way.\n\"When Swansea had the ball we pressed so good and so intense and then when we had the ball we had to keep it moving, moving, moving, playing simple, until we had the chance to play a final pass.\n\"Swansea have had good results under Carlos Carvalhal against Arsenal and Liverpool and that's why it was so important to focus, play well and score.\"\nSwansea boss Carlos Carvalhal told BBC Sport: \"It was a difficult game for us. They had just lost one home game against Manchester United. They are champions; they are a team from another planet.\n\"We are playing to survive. We lose one game and at this moment we are still four points from the teams behind us.\n\"This game, we forget it and we move to the next game to try and achieve the points.\n\"We have recovered nine points in three months, we have four games left. It is in our hands. I hope we can solve the things before the last two games but if we don't, we have the two games at the end I think with the determination and commitment we have we will achieve it.\"\nMan City's season of domination - the best of the stats\nManchester City have now won 29 games in the Premier League this season; their most ever in a top-flight league campaign.\nTheir total of 90 points is already more than 16 of the previous 22 champions in a 38-game Premier League season.\nManchester City have won each of their seven Premier League games against Swansea at the Etihad, scoring 19 goals and conceding only three in return.\nThis was Swansea's joint-heaviest defeat in the Premier League, and the fifth time they've lost by a five-goal margin (also against Liverpool twice, Chelsea and Spurs).\nSince winning their first away game under Carlos Carvalhal in the Premier League (2-1 at Watford), Swansea have gone seven away trips without a victory (D4 L3).\nRaheem Sterling has scored 18 goals in the Premier League this season; twice as many as he did in his previous best campaign (9 for Liverpool in 2013/14).\nDavid Silva (nine goals, 11 assists) has been directly involved in 20 or more goals in a Premier League season for the first time since 2011-12 (21).\nPep Guardiola's side recorded 83% possession and completed 942 passes over the course of 90 minutes; both of which are the most by any side in a Premier League game since 2003/04.\nKevin De Bruyne has now scored five goals from outside the box in the Premier League this season; the most of any player.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea host Chelsea in their next Premier League match on 28 April (17:30 BST), while Manchester City travel to London to take on West Ham on 29 April (14:15 BST)."

You can't knock our football,\" he said to Sky Sports after the match.\n\"You can knock some of our passing that went astray, but you can't knock me for that. I don't pass the ball.\n\"Apart from the last 10 minutes we dominated the game and there was only going to be one winner.\"\nA dull first half bore all the hallmarks of an end-of-season, mid-table encounter with goalscoring opportunities at a premium.\nHowever, the deadlock was broken soon after the break when Yannick Bolasie's cross deflected off DeAndre Yedlin to Walcott, who took a touch before driving the ball into the roof of the net.\nThe game briefly opened up after that and Newcastle substitute Dwight Gayle should have done better when he hooked a shot over from close range, before Seamus Coleman made an important headed clearance in stoppage time.\nUltimately, a lack of quality in the final third proved Newcastle's undoing as they spurned several other opportunities to create something and Everton recorded a first win in four games to move onto 45 points.\nNewcastle remain in 10th place on 41 points and need just one more point to be mathematically safe from relegation.\nFootball Daily podcast: 'Nothing to get excited about watching Everton'\nRobot helps 'inspirational' 14-year-old be Everton mascot\nA win, but is it enough for Everton fans?\nAllardyce has taken Everton to mid-table safety from just above the relegation zone, but there has been growing discontent among some supporters at what they perceive to be a negative playing style.\nThere were calls for Allardyce to be sacked during the 1-1 draw at Swansea earlier this month, with some fans unhappy with their side's display - and his critics were unlikely to be appeased by this performance.\nEverton seemed uncertain how to break down a disciplined Newcastle side, while Cenk Tosun found himself far too isolated from his team-mates in attack.\nThe hosts failed to manage a shot on target in a drab first half and it was one moment of quality from Walcott that proved decisive in a game both sets of fans will be keen to forget.\nEverton are now on course for a top-eight finish and Allardyce, who succeeded the sacked Ronald Koeman in November, added: \"I think eighth in the league compared to fifth from bottom tells you we're getting the players better.\n\"We've moved up the league one place again, so we're on the right track and moving in the right direction.\"\nBut former Toffees midfielder Leon Osman, commentating on the game for BBC Radio 5 live, said: \"This may be a victory but it is hardly an exciting one.\n\"Sam Allardyce sends his teams out to win, he is not always fussed about performances. He will be delighted with a win and a clean sheet.\n\"People expect a standard of performance. The three points will be important but the crowd come to be excited. There was hardly a chance in this game and not enough excitement. That is the story of the season for Everton.\"\nMan of the match - Theo Walcott\n'Final ball missing' - what they said\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"I am pleased with the effort of the players but this final pass in the final third can make the difference.\n\"We are really strong.

This is not for the faint-hearted. We are in a fight. I will take the fight for anything, and so will the lads.\"\nLiverpool winger Mohamed Salah missed the chance to break the record for most goals in a 38-game Premier League season when he clipped wide after being sent clear on goal after five minutes.\nThat let-off focused the visitors, who could have won the game late on but Ryan Shawcross poked narrowly wide moments after Liverpool had a penalty appeal for handball against Erik Pieters turned down.\n\"We deserved it - we came with a good gameplan and played a really good game; the commitment, throwing bodies into challenges, and we might have sneaked it,\" said Lambert, who replaced Mark Hughes in January.\n\"If we had played like that from the start of the season, I would not be here and they would be cruising in the league.\"\nPieters stars for dogged Potters\nStoke's resolute defensive performance was epitomised by Pieters.\nThe Dutch defender, who was at fault for Salah's chance, rarely let the Liverpool winger get more than an arm's length away from him for the rest of the game.\n\"I thought Pieters played brilliantly\" said Lambert. \"Salah has been on fire this season but Erik was outstanding.\"\nPieters was canny in how and when he fouled Salah - harassing but never aggressive enough to pick up a booking - while he was on hand to fell the Egyptian before he could get a shot away with Jack Butland out of his goal following a poor spill by the Stoke keeper.\nPieters was lucky too. Liverpool should have had a penalty when Georginio Wijnaldum's cross struck the Stoke defender's arm on 87 minutes but referee Andre Marriner and his team waved away the hosts' appeals.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport it looked a \"clear\" penalty and that his side \"should have got more penalties\" in the league this season.\nLambert said: \"If that was a penalty we may as well all just have left. It is never a penalty. You can understand Jurgen Klopp's frustration about it but it's no penalty.\"\nThe visitors were physical but not excessively so - capable of frustrating an in-form attack that has scored 80 Premier League goals this season, with Kurt Zouma also impressive in defence.\nAnd they had a chance to steal a shock win two minutes from time as Mame Biram Diouf's effort evaded Loris Karius and the back post, with Shawcross stealing in but unable to turn it in.\nUltimately it was not enough for victory but it was enough to stave off relegation - for now at least.\nSalah's off day\nSalah will have to wait at least another week to set a new record for most goals scored in a Premier League season since the league was cut to 20 teams in 1995.\nHis 32nd strike seemed like a formality when Jordan Henderson slid a pass from deep through a chasm in the Stoke defence to play Salah through, but his chip over Butland drifted wide.\nIt set the tone for a rare off day for both Salah and Liverpool, with the hosts creating little of note until the 20th minute when Salah played in Trent Alexander-Arnold on the overlap but the right-back could not get the ball out of his feet.\nDanny Ings then had a goal disallowed for offside shortly before the break after he crashed a volley high past Butland from a narrow angle when Wijnaldum's blocked shot fell to him, just the wrong side of the last man.\nAfter the interval, passes became wayward, crosses were not quite met and frustration showed for a Reds side showing five changes from the team that glided past Roma on Tuesday.\n\"I saw everything I wanted to see except fluency and fun and joy, it is hard on a day like this. Stoke were a little lucky in some situations,\" said Klopp.\n\"We had to make changes, that is always a bit of a rhythm breaker, in the final third everything is instinct between the regulars, and we missed a bit of that. But no-one was seriously injured so we carry on.\"\nLiverpool's second straight league draw against relegation candidates may not be ideal preparation but they can move on quickly by focusing on Wednesday night in Rome.\nMan of the match - Erik Pieters (Stoke)\nLambert frustrates Liverpool again - match stats\nLiverpool failed to score at Anfield in the league for the first time in nine games (since a 0-0 v West Brom in December), after scoring 27 in total in the eight before that.\nStoke City are without a win in 12 Premier League games, their longest run without a victory in the top flight since December 1984 (17).\nTheirs is also the current longest winless run across the top four divisions of English football.\nThe Potters are without a win in 13 away league games (D6 L7), since a 1-0 win against Watford in October.\nLambert has taken charge of more Premier League games at Anfield without ever losing than any other manager in the competition (5 - W2 D3).\nSalah had seven shots (none on target), the most he has had without scoring in a single game for Liverpool in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool play Roma in their Champions League semi-final second leg at 19:45 BST on Wednesday, 2 May before travelling to Chelsea on Sunday, 6 May (16:30 kick-off).\nStoke host Crystal Palace on Saturday, 5 May at 12:30."

We can talk about ifs and buts - we ain't going to change what's gone on at the start of the season.\n\"We just look to the next game, and this was a difficult game and we have had to work extremely hard to get a positive result.\"\nThe Midlands club are at home to Tottenham next Saturday before travelling to Crystal Palace for the final day of the season. A point for the Swans at Bournemouth next week would see West Brom relegated.\nWest Brom just needed one goal to see off Newcastle on Saturday, with Matt Phillips smashing in a 29th-minute strike after being picked out by Jake Livermore.\nJames McClean and Jay Rodriguez also went close for the Baggies, while their keeper Ben Foster made a sensational save to keep out Dwight Gayle's header.\nThe Magpies were also denied by the post after Kenedy had beaten Foster with a poked shot.\nRelive the action from St James' Park\nA stay of execution?\nAlthough footballing miracles are possible - remember Leicester's title win in 2015-16? - the Baggies remain strong favourites to go down.\nAt least Moore - loved by the fans and, seemingly, the players - has injected the team with some belief, which was sorely missing under the stewardship of former managers Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew.\nAt St James' Park, the Baggies showed the sort of gutsy performance Newcastle had shown in recent weeks. However, with safety assured, Newcastle's levels have dropped and the Baggies took advantage.\nThey went ahead just before the half-hour mark as Phillips, who was brilliant on the wing, rifled the ball past Martin Dubravka.\nHad striker Salomon Rondon been at his sharpest, West Brom might have added to their lead, while Rodriguez forced a good low save from the Newcastle keeper.\nThe Baggies defence was barely tested, with Newcastle's attack lacking bite.\nMagpies on holiday\nNewcastle appear to have switched off since securing their Premier League status - defeat on Saturday was the first time they had suffered back-to-back losses in 2018.\nThe influential Jonjo Shelvey, Matt Ritchie and Kenedy were all off their game, although the latter went closest for the home side when his shot came off the foot of the post in the first half.\nSubstitute Joselu, who has failed to make an impact since arriving on Tyneside in the summer, should have earned Newcastle a late equaliser but inexplicably headed wide from six yards.\nMan of the match - Matt Phillips (West Brom)\n'We'll enjoy today and look forward' - reaction\nWest Brom caretaker boss Darren Moore: \"We did everything that was asked of us. We came to a tough arena, against a good team, and we needed to perform well to come away with a result.\n\"I was pleased with the result, it was a good, solid performance. We could have scored more goals, we had plenty of chances, and after we scored our defence was resolute too.\n\"We're just continuing to look forward to the next game now, we'll enjoy today, and look forward.\"\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez on BBC's MOTD: \"We tried to do it, but I'm not happy with our performance on the ball, without the ball. Everything we did in the last few games, we didn't do.\n\"We wanted to get more points to finish higher in the table, but we didn't do well today, we made a lot of mistakes, and we weren't good enough.\n\"We didn't think the job was done, but it's a pity because we've had a good season, but we want to finish better, too. I congratulate the players for a good season, but we need to be better than today.\n\"The target was to stay up, but if we can finish ninth we want to do that.\"\nBenitez's run against Baggies ends - the stats\nIn just four matches, Moore (W2 D2 L0) has won more Premier League games for West Brom than Pardew (W1 D5 L12), and as many as Pulis (W2 D4 L6) did for the Baggies this season.\nWest Brom kept their first league clean sheet at St James' Park since September 1977, ending a run of 15 straight games in which they had conceded at the ground.\nNewcastle have lost back-to-back league games for the first time since a run of four in December.\nThis was Benitez's first Premier League defeat against West Brom as manager (W7 D1 L1), meaning Stoke are now the side he has faced the most without defeat in the competition (seven games).\nPhillips' goal was his first in 22 games in all competitions for West Brom, since netting against Manchester City in October.\nThere were 15 shots in total in the second half in this game (10 for Newcastle, five for West Brom), but none were on target.\nWhat's next?\nThe Baggies face Tottenham at home next Saturday, 5 May (15:00 BST).

He was also the target of less-than-complimentary chants.\nAllardyce, in his defence, can point to a Premier League table that shows Everton lying in a comfortable eighth place after another three points, and a joyless season will end without anxiety.\nHe will regard this as the successful completion of the task he was recruited to perform - but it is increasingly hard to see how Allardyce's pragmatic style will win over the cynics among Everton supporters.\nFan scepticism is something Allardyce has lived with at various stages in his career and it shows no sign of changing any time soon.\nHuddersfield face anxious finale\nThis was a potentially crucial game for Huddersfield Town, and the mood of anticipation around the atmospheric John Smith's Stadium reflected the fact that victory here would have virtually assured Premier League safety.\nHuddersfield's supporters delivered their usual magnificent backing and the work-rate of Wagner's players was prodigious - but they simply could not find the composure and quality required at the vital times when they had periods of supremacy.\nIndeed, Tosun's opener came at the end of Huddersfield's best spell and switched the entire emphasis of a game in which moments of class were in short supply.\nAnd now, from a position where this one win could have given them relative comfort, they face a potentially anxious end to the season, with a hazardous final three games away to Manchester City and Chelsea, and at home to Arsenal.\nSchneiderlin's upturn in fortunes\nMorgan Schneiderlin's season of misery hit a nadir shortly after Allardyce's arrival, when he became the butt of fierce criticism from Everton's supporters.\nIt was all in stark contrast to the manner in which he distinguished himself after his \u00a324m move from Manchester United in the January transfer window last season.\nSchneiderlin, to his credit, has worked hard to rehabilitate himself and was outstanding again here. It must have been sweet for the talented France midfielder to hear his name being chanted loudly by Everton's fans.\nIt is hardly enough to salvage a miserable season at Goodison Park, but at least he is ending the season on an upward curve.\nMan of the match - Morgan Schneiderlin\n'It's still match point' - Manager reaction\nHuddersfield boss David Wagner: \"The support from the stands was great. We gave everything but we were beaten by quality in the end.\n\"We missed opportunities and they scored with their first effort on goal and then in the second half we were not at the same level.\n\"We have to deal with it and we will deal with it. We had four match points before this game and now we have three left.\"\nEverton boss Sam Allardyce: \"Confidence grows and performances are getting better and better. That's 14 points from the last seven games.\n\"Let's see if we can go to the end of the season undefeated. I have every respect for every club I have worked at and am trying my very best.\n\"I'm sure the fans have gone home happy today and so they should. They haven't seen many results and performances away from home in the last two and a half years.\"\nHuddersfield's goal problems - the stats\nEverton have won two of their past three Premier League away games (W2 D1 L0), more than they had in their previous 23 on the road (W1 D9 L13).\nHuddersfield have failed to score in 19 different Premier League games this season, the joint-most by a promoted side in their debut season in the competition (level with Cardiff in 2013-14).\nThis was Everton's first away win in the league by more than one goal since 26 December 2016, when they won 2-0 at Leicester.\nCenk Tosun scored his fourth away Premier League goal of the season - no Everton player has scored more on the road in 2017-18 (level with Wayne Rooney).\nBaines has been involved in 82 Premier League goals for Everton (29 goals, 53 assists), behind only Romelu Lukaku (91) and Duncan Ferguson (83) for the Toffees in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nEverton host relegation-threatened Southampton on Saturday, 5 May (17:30 BST), while Huddersfield travel to Premier League champions Manchester City a day later for a 13:30 kick-off."

It was a huge effort.\"\nTadic put the home side ahead with a low finish after a swift counter-attack, only for Bournemouth forward Joshua King to fire in an equaliser seconds before half-time.\nTadic restored the advantage with a precise finish after a penetrating run, although Saints needed keeper Alex McCarthy to make a flying save from Ryan Fraser in stoppage time.\nSouthampton hung on to earn their first home league win since beating Everton in November, ending a run of nine games without victory at St Mary's.\nHughes' side visit fourth-bottom Swansea in what looks set to be a pivotal match on 8 May.\nFollow all the post-match reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive Southampton's hard-fought win\nSaints marching on to survival?\nHughes failed to chalk up a victory in his opening four Premier League matches after replacing Mauricio Pellegrino, which left his new club in the relegation zone and at risk of being cut adrift.\nNo wonder the Welshman described the visit of Bournemouth as \"arguably\" the most important of a managerial career spanning almost 600 matches.\nA nervy atmosphere around St Mary's changed when Tadic punished the away side for switching off, Saints swiftly turning defence into attack as Mario Lemina sprang forward before picking out the Serb, who coolly converted with a low angled shot from 15 yards.\nSaints have had a nasty habit of throwing leads away this season - and it was a case of deja vu as Bournemouth levelled with almost the last kick of the first half.\nThe Cherries, who were looking for their first win at St Mary's, only managed their first shot on target seconds before King pounced at the far post when Saints were unpicked by an away corner.\nA furious-looking Hughes marched down the tunnel at half-time, presumably to have some stern words with his side for switching off defensively, and they returned after the break with renewed purpose.\nTadic pounced on an error from Cherries defender Steve Cook, who tried to chest down a long punt by McCarthy, the Serb surging forward before precisely slotting in the winner.\nHughes was unusually animated in the closing stages, a mark of how important the match was to Saints, urging more noise from his team's supporters.\nThey obliged and the home team responded with a dogged - and sometimes desperate - defensive display to keep Bournemouth out.\n\"The new coach gave us extra power and experience and finally we gave him something back,\" said Tadic.\nCherries on the verge of safety\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe has refused to accept his team are safe from relegation, despite sitting in 12th place and six points above third-bottom Saints.\nVictory at neighbouring Saints - something they had not achieved in 13 previous attempts - would have mathematically assured Howe's side of a fourth consecutive season of Premier League football.\nThat they are already so far ahead of the drop zone is testament to the hard work and resilience of Howe and his players.\nHaving lost seven of their opening 10 matches, the Cherries did not emerge out of the bottom three until early November and were also there as recently as 26 December.\nA fine run of form has since prevented any serious concerns, but after a performance which he described as \"disappointing\", Howe says he is still looking over his shoulder.\nHis side threatened more in the latter stages as Southampton retreated and almost nicked a point when Fraser's arcing drive was stopped by McCarthy.\n\"The goals we conceded were big mistakes and we got punished for them,\" Howe said.\n\"I am disappointed with how we played, it was a game we could and should have won if we play like we can, but we didn't.\"\nMan of the match - Dusan Tadic (Southampton)\n'A draw or a loss wouldn't do' - post-match reaction\nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes: \"Everyone knew the circumstance, we needed a win and draw or a loss wouldn't do. This is only a part of what we need to do, but good for us.\n\"I thought we were good value for the lead, then we conceded from a set-piece. Worry sets in about how the guys react, we have been damaged by previous results, but to a man they all stepped up, dug in, got back in the lead.\n\"At the end we were throwing bodies to keep them out. It is a huge result for us, doesn't mean anything yet but potentially significant.\n\"We need to have the teams above us looking over their shoulder, and this result does that. They know we have good quality.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"The spirit is there and the will to do well is there, but for whatever reason we complicated the game, made too many bad decisions individually which hurt us collectively.\n\"We have got to show that pride in trying to achieve and win. We have got two games to do that now.\"\nSouthampton not a great day out for Bournemouth - the stats\nBournemouth have now failed to win any of their 14 trips to Southampton in all competitions, losing nine and drawing five.\nSaints have scored two or more goals in both of their home league games under Hughes, as many times as they managed in their last 14 matches at St Mary's under Pellegrino.\nThe Cherries have now conceded at least 60 goals in all three of their seasons in the Premier League.\nOnly two other sides have conceded 60 or more goals in three or more successive Premier League seasons - Southampton (1992-93 to 1994-95) and Wigan Athletic (2009-10 to 2012-13).\nTadic, who scored his first Premier League brace since April 2016 against Aston Villa, became only the third Serbian player to score 20+ Premier League goals, after Savo Milosevic (29) and Branislav Ivanovic (22).\nKing became the first Bournemouth player to score away at Southampton in any competition since October 1987, and the first to do so in a league match since February 1960.\nWhat's next?\nAnother important game for Southampton's Premier League survival hopes. The Saints go to Everton next Saturday (17:15 BST), while Bournemouth host Swansea at 15:00 BST."

I thought we were the better side, more likely to score. Burnley are very effective and we had to defend well, but I thought we had the better opportunities.\n\"We have the points in the bag and those below us have to win games. We will go into every game with the possibility of getting the points in all of them - we have every chance if we go into the games with the endeavour we did today.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to Sky Sports: \"It was a game of huff and puff, lacking quality. A lot of endeavour, good habits and doing the basics. It's hard to question these lads, you have the odd dip in form and to come out with a point is a good measure.\n\"It's still a good point, still a clean sheet, but not the performance we're used to. I'm very pleased with the whole season, to say the least.\"\nMan of the match - Kevin Long (Burnley)\nBurnley keep it clean - the key stats\nBurnley ended a run of eight top-flight home games without a clean sheet.\nBrighton have scored a league-low nine away goals in the Premier League this season.\nBrighton have lost on just one of their past eight league visits to Turf Moor.\nOnly in eight games against Tottenham has Dyche faced an opponent more often as Burnley manager than seven against Brighton without a single victory.\nBrighton have been involved in a joint-league-high five goalless draws in the Premier League this season, level with Southampton.\nA league-high 17 of Burnley's Premier League games this season have been goalless at half-time, with Brighton, Huddersfield and West Brom next on 15.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Arsenal in their next Premier League match on Sunday, 6 May (16:30 BST), after Brighton host Manchester United on Friday, 4 May (20:00 BST)."

No-one wants to tempt fate too much in that respect, but it would take a lot for a team with 38 points and such a good goal difference as we have to go down.\n\"If we survive, which I believe we will, it's going to be a very heart-warming occasion for everybody.\n\"In some way we did expect to get that last win and secure our status, so it's more a relief than celebration.\"\nLeicester, who are ninth, look to be finishing the season with a whimper after picking up only four wins in their past 18 league matches.\nThis latest result and performance puts more pressure on manager Claude Puel, with speculation already mounting about his future.\nFollow all the post-match reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive Palace's big win over Leicester\nUps, downs and European qualification\nHodgson's great escape (nearly)\nSince taking over from Frank de Boer in September, when the club were bottom of the table with no points and no goals to their name, Hodgson has steadily turned things around at Selhurst Park.\nThe former England boss has won nine and drawn 11 of his 32 games in charge, and Saturday's performance against Leicester - in particular their first two goals - showed the positive effect the 70-year-old has had on the team.\nZaha was once again a shining light and he opened the scoring, with his fourth goal in as many games, when he thundered the ball into the top of the net from a McArthur back-heel.\nThe Ivory Coast international returned the favour when he side-footed across the box to McArthur, who swivelled and struck past Hamer.\nPalace continued to push for more in the second half and were able to make the extra man count, earning them their biggest win of the season.\nHodgson said after the game: \"I am so proud of the players and happy for them. We have not had an easy time.\n\"We have shot ourselves in the foot at times but to overcome that and keep going it makes me very proud. It is a testament not just to their ability but their character.\"\nIs Puel in trouble?\nIt could have been a very different story for Leicester had Jamie Vardy pounced on a loose back pass by Mamadou Sakho inside three minutes, but the Foxes striker was denied by the quick reactions of goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.\nThe England international then had another first-half chance cleared off the line by Joel Ward, but they were just two of the nine touches he took in the entire game.\nAlbrighton's sending-off set Leicester back even further and they ran out of substitutes after 50 minutes, as Kelechi Iheanacho and Hamza Choudhury were replaced at half-time, and Wilfred Ndidi was forced off through injury.\nSeveral newspapers have claimed this week that Puel will be let go as part of an overhaul at the King Power Stadium this summer.\nLeicester may be tucked safely in mid-table but the manner of this defeat, and their run of four games without a win, means the pressure is on for the Frenchman, who was sacked by Southampton after one season last June.\nHe refused to be drawn on the speculation after the game, saying: \"I pay no attention to it. No comments about it. At the moment it is difficult for my team.\"\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha\nZaha in form - the best stats\nZaha has scored four goals in his past four league games, as many as in his previous 24.\nOnly Chris Armstrong (23) has scored more Premier League goals for Palace than Zaha (21, level with Andrew Johnson).\nMcArthur scored and assisted in a single top-flight game for only the third time in his career, the first since September 2016.\nLeicester have picked up five red cards in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nThe Foxes shipped five goals without scoring themselves for the first time in the league since January 2004.\nWhat next?\nCrystal Palace's final two games come against relegation-threatened Stoke City (5 May, 12:30 BST) and West Brom (13 May, 15:00 BST). Leicester face West Ham at home next Saturday, 5 May (15:00 BST)."

Kyle Naughton, Tom Carroll and Wayne Routledge also went close.\nSwansea claimed for a penalty when Gary Cahill challenged Nathan Dyer, with the Chelsea defender also involved in a clash with Jordan Ayew in injury time after a late barge from the Ghanaian.\nWith Southampton seemingly having the momentum, Swansea might have to take more chances at Bournemouth next weekend to avoid a do-or-die final week.\n\"When we arrived we were five points away from the teams above,\" Carvalhal said.\n\"We depended on others to try and get out of this position.

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal\nArsene Wenger's final trip to Manchester United as Arsenal manager ended in an agonising defeat after an injury-time winner from Marouane Fellaini.\nThe Belgium international flicked a header past Gunners goalkeeper David Ospina from an Ashley Young cross.\nJust three minutes earlier he had headed against the post, with Marcus Rashford bundling home the rebound from an offside position.\nUnited had opened the scoring on 16 minutes when a header from former Arsenal player Alexis Sanchez was knocked on to the post by Hector Bellerin and Paul Pogba stabbed home the rebound for his third goal in four league games.\nThe hosts lost striker Romelu Lukaku to injury early in the second half, and moments later Henrikh Mkhitaryan was left in plenty of space to weave and strike through the legs of Victor Lindelof.\nThe game's tempo petered out after the equaliser - until Fellaini - who Jose Mourinho says is close to a new contract - popped up to snatch the win for United, and secure Champions League football for next season.\nThe best of frenemies\nWenger had joked before Sunday's match that he \"always got a great reception at Old Trafford\" - referring to his long-standing rivalry with United.\nOn this occasion, it was true. Old foe Sir Alex Ferguson was master of ceremonies in a pre-match presentation for the Frenchman, who will leave Arsenal at the end of the season after 22 years as manager.\nThe crowd applauded as Wenger was given a silver vase by former United boss Ferguson, and the pair embraced during a photo opportunity in which they were briefly joined by current Red Devils manager Mourinho.\n\"It was very nice and classy. I enjoyed it,\" Wenger said after the game. \"I have come here for a long, long time. Next year, someone else will be in the dug-out and it will be a hostile environment again.\"\nThe atmosphere did change after Pogba's opener, with the home crowd chanting 'we want you to stay' and the Arsenal fans responding: 'Arsene Wenger, he won the league here.'\nWenger - whose team won the title at Old Trafford in 2002\n, external\n- started the game smiling, but left disappointed after his side stretched their winless run here to 11 matches.\nThe Frenchman admitted he was unsure whether he would meet Mourinho again, saying: \"He will be at Man Utd next year certainly and I don't know where I will be.\n\"I have worked at a top level for 35 years without any interruption and I think I am the only one who has done that. I am in unknown territory.\n\"Will I take a break? I will be surprised if I meet him next year.\"\nWhen asked about his gift, Wenger revealed: \"I don't know [what it is]. I haven't looked at it. I want to have a glass of red wine with Sir Alex because it is always good wine. Once you are not a danger any more, people love you.\"\nArsenal's winless away run goes on\nWenger opted to make eight changes to his team, with one eye on Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Atletico Madrid, which is poised at 1-1.\nWith an average age of 24 years and 67 days, it was Arsenal's youngest starting XI in the Premier League since August 2011 - in their infamous 8-2 defeat at Old Trafford.\nIt was a different story this time around. The Gunners made few mistakes and looked lively in parts, with Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Danny Welbeck testing United keeper David de Gea.\nMkhitaryan produced a cool and accurate finish for his goal, before being taken off with a knee injury which will be assessed before Thursday.\nBut three defenders failed to deal with a rising Fellani in the box as he headed home a winning goal that meant Arsenal remain the only team in England's top five tiers without an away win in 2018.\n\"The players are destroyed because they gave everything and were caught in the final minute,\" said the Gunners boss.\n\"There were many question marks if we would be strong enough to fight but the quality was good the spirit was good, many players stood up. It was a negative result and a positive performance.\"\n'We want second'\nUnited's final chance for silverware this season comes on 19 May, when they face Chelsea in the FA Cup final.\nVictory over Arsenal means they will definitely finish in the top four in the league, but Mourinho is adamant they are aiming for second behind champions Manchester City.\n\"We won three points and that kills the Champions League story,\" he said after the game.\n\"But we still need four points to finish second which is what we want.\"\nUnited now have a five-point advantage over third-placed Liverpool with a game in hand.\nWenger's Old Trafford hoodoo - the stats from Man Utd's win\nOther than at Emirates Stadium and Highbury, Wenger has lost more matches at Old Trafford as Arsenal manager than at any other ground.\nUnited completed a Premier League double over the Gunners for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign.\nFellaini's goal was the first 90th-minute winner United have scored against Arsenal in the Premier League, and the first in this fixture since January 2007, when Thierry Henry scored one at the Emirates in the home side's 2-1 win.\nUnited have won all 10 of the Premier League games in which Pogba has found the net.\nMan of the match - Ashley Young\nWhat's next?\nManchester United visit Brighton in the Premier League on Friday (20:00 BST).

It puts us in a very good position fighting for the top four and that is the objective for the rest of the season.\"\nSpurs capitalised on an error from Hornets goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis as Christian Eriksen set up Alli and the England midfielder scored from 12 yards out.\nKane doubled Spurs' lead early in the second half from Kieran Trippier's pull-back and Jan Vertonghen later headed against the post.\nSpurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris denied Andre Gray and Richarlison, with the Brazilian also shooting over from six yards out.\nThe visitors are still not guaranteed Premier League safety and this defeat extended their winless run to seven matches.\nRelive Tottenham versus Watford as it happened\nKane v Salah for the Golden Boot\nIt was a welcome goal for Kane, who had only scored twice in his previous eight games, with one of those efforts - the winner at Stoke on 7 April - controversially awarded to him by the Premier League goals accreditation panel after he claimed Eriksen's free-kick had touched his shoulder before going in.\nNevertheless, there was no doubt about Kane's 27th league goal of the season - his 38th in all competitions - in the 49th minute when he steered in Trippier's pass.\nThat goal means Kane is four behind Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, who has 31, as the England centre-forward aims to win the Golden Boot - awarded to the Premier League's leading goalscorer - for the third successive season.\nKane had earlier wasted two chances, with a weak side-footed effort directed at Karnezis, and another opportunity slipping away with a heavy touch when collecting a pass from Son Heung-min.\nWith England manager Gareth Southgate watching on, Kane had further chances to add to his tally but failed to connect with the rebound after Vertonghen's header hit the post and then had a goal ruled out when he was offside, moving too early from the Belgium defender's pass.\nGracia and Watford's poor run goes on\nWatford's disappointing end to the season continues. They are 13th, but only six points above Southampton in 18th, who have three games left to play.\nThe Hornets' biggest problem has been in front of goal; they have scored nine times in 13 matches under Javi Gracia. Four of those goals came in one game - a memorable 4-1 win over Chelsea on 5 February.\nAndre Gray, with four goals in 31 matches since an \u00a318.5m move from Burnley last August, should have done better with a low strike that was comfortably saved.\nSpurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris also produced a fine one-handed save to deny Richarlison, who later wasted a glorious chance when he blasted over from six yards out after substitute Troy Deeney's knockdown. In injury-time, Lloris secured another clean sheet for him with a fine save to block Andre Carillo's powerful strike.\nWatford sacked former boss Marco Silva in January with the club 10th in the table, but on a run of only one win in 11 games after the Portuguese coach had been repeatedly linked with the managerial position at Everton.\nGracia led Watford to an initial upturn in form, with 10 points from his first five league games, although they have picked up two points from seven matches since then.\nA finish of 13th two seasons ago did not keep Quique Sanchez Flores in his job, nor was 17th enough last season to save Walter Mazzarri, and Gracia's future at the club is looking insecure after only 13 games in charge.\nThe Hornets' last two games are at home against Newcastle on Saturday, 5 May before an away game at FA Cup finalists Manchester United on the final day of the season and Watford need two points to mathematically guarantee their Premier League status.\nSpurs keep scoring run going - the stats\nTottenham have scored in each of their past 23 Premier League games, their longest scoring run in the top flight since April 1987 (26 games).\nWatford have gone seven Premier League away games without scoring (drew one, lost six), since Andre Gray found the net against Manchester City on 2 January.\nHarry Kane made his 150th appearance in the Premier League. In those games Kane has netted 105 goals; only Alan Shearer managed more in his first 150 in the competition (121).\nChristian Eriksen has been directly involved in nine goals in his past eight games in all competitions (five goals, four assists).\nEriksen (10 goals, 10 assists) is the third Spurs player to register 10-plus goals and 10-plus assists in a single Premier League season, after Jurgen Klinsmann in 1994-95 and Emmanuel Adebayor in 2011-12.\nDele Alli has been involved in seven goals in his past seven games for Spurs in all competitions (five goals, two assists).\nWatford are the only side to have more than one goalkeeper make an error leading to goal this season in the Premier League (two each for Heurelho Gomes and Orestis Karnezis).\nKieran Trippier has notched one goal and five assists in his six top-flight appearances against Watford.\nMan of the match - Kieran Trippier (Tottenham)\n'There was tension in the stadium' - analysis\nFormer Tottenham and England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on BBC Radio 5 live\nIt was job done for Tottenham, but it wasn't the most vintage performance. There was a lot of tension in the stadium and that transmitted to the players.\nThere were a few dodgy touches and passing was not on the money. They got three points, which is the most important thing.\nThey had Chelsea slowly creeping up on them too, so they now have an opportunity to start looking upwards rather than behind them.\nWatford are a bunch of individuals; they get broken down too easily. Without that togetherness, they leak goals. In midfield, they are either brilliant or shocking, and those inconsistencies are baffling fans.\n'Lloris was great' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"Hugo Lloris showed he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, he was great.\"\nOn Harry Kane, Pochettino added: \"He is working hard to try to recover his real performance. For him to score 105 goals in 150 games is very good.\n\"He is chasing [Mohamed Salah] but the most important thing is to score goals for the team.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia told BBC Sport: \"I think we had a good performance.\n\"We created many chances in the first half, we did not score and Tottenham with their first chance scored. It was very tough after that to try to get the points.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham play at bottom-of-the-table West Brom on Saturday, 5 May (15:00 BST), while Watford entertain Newcastle United at the same time."

We have come a long way and through some tough periods,\" Hughton added.\nBrighton's first top-flight campaign since 1983 concludes with away games against Manchester City and Liverpool.\nAlbion - who had not won in their previous seven games - had the better chances against United and David de Gea did well to deny Glenn Murray and Izquierdo.\nMarcus Rashford forced a good save from Mat Ryan in the second half.\n'Why always Lukaku? You know now' - Mourinho takes a swipe at fringe players\nSeagulls can plan for next season\nThe Seagulls were looking comfortable on 4 March when they beat Arsenal 2-1 to move into the top half of the Premier League. But seven games without a win in all competitions since then had seen some doubt creep in.\nHowever, after moving on to 40 points and into 11th place, they cannot be caught by the bottom three - prompting a party atmosphere at the final whistle - and Chris Hughton can start getting ready for the club's second season in the top flight since 1983.\nAnthony Knockaert and Izquierdo were fantastic on the two wings - likewise Gross in the centre - and caused United problems from start to finish.\nAlbion started brightly and Dale Stephens shot wide in the eighth minute. United keeper De Gea made two decent saves to stop Gross - and two fantastic diving saves to keep out Murray's 25-yard shot on the bounce and Izquierdo's rising hit.\nThe Seagulls fully merited their goal when Gross beat Ashley Young in the air to send Izquierdo's cross past De Gea.\nThe summer signing from Ingolstadt has been involved in 45% of Brighton's Premier League goals all season - seven goals and eight assists.\nBrighton did not create many chances following that goal but showed good game management to see the game out.\nAlbion are now eight points above the relegation zone, but because Swansea and Southampton, who have three games left, play each other on Tuesday, it is impossible for both sides to get enough points to catch Brighton.\nBlunt United fail to impress\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho says whether his side finish second in the league will determine whether the FA Cup finalists have had a good season overall.\nThey remain five points clear of third-placed Liverpool, although Tottenham - one point further back with a game in hand - can also catch them.\nWith Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez injured, Marcus Rashford got his chance in the centre-forward position but failed to take his opportunity.\nUnited only had one touch in the Albion area in the first half, and their first effort on target did not come until the 49th minute when Paul Pogba's low shot was saved from 16 yards out.\nThey did create some chances after Gross' goal with Rashford and substitute Jesse Lingard forcing saves from outside the box and Anthony Martial striking two efforts over the bar from 20 yards.\nThe Red Devils did have one final chance but Lingard shot wide under pressure from Shane Duffy.\nThis is the first time United have ever lost away to three newly promoted clubs in a league season - they have been beaten at Huddersfield, Newcastle and now at the Amex Stadium, the 58th different ground they have visited in the Premier League.\n'They beat us in the attitude' - manager reaction\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton to BBC Sport: \"Manchester United showed the quality they've got. Without us putting in the work we did, we wouldn't have got anything from the game.\n\"We've had three results - against Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United - where we've had to put in that kind of performance, and be good with the ball too. We deserved it tonight. Knockaert was outstanding, not just with the ball. Against teams like this you've got to work as hard without possession. It's good to see him in that kind of form.\n\"With Pascal Gross, what's been important for us is he hasn't been injured and he's always been available for us. We've probably been fortunate we've had a lot of players available in that area of the pitch.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho to BBC Sport: \"Football was fair to the Brighton boys, they had a big target, they showed the point would be a big thing for them and gave everything for that.\n\"I couldn't persuade my players that second place was very important to us. I know we can do it, we only have two matches to get the four points we need. They beat us in the attitude.\n\"For 10 months I get asked 'why always Lukaku? Why always Lukaku, why always Lukaku? Why always this player? That guy doesn't have a chance to start, the other one is on the bench.' You know why now.\"\nMan of the match - Anthony Knockaert (Brighton)\nStats - United's first Friday Premier League defeat\nBrighton registered only their second win in 19 matches against Manchester United, their first since a 1-0 victory in the top flight in November 1982.\nJose Mourinho has lost six of his past 10 away Premier League matches in the month of May (W1 D3).\nAll seven of Pascal Gross' Premier League goals have come at home - only four players have scored more Premier League goals exclusively at home in the competition's history - Georginio Wijnaldum (18), Clive Wilson (9), Ronny Johnsen (8) and Jeff Kenna (8).\nThis was Manchester United's first league defeat on a Friday since December 1978, when they lost 3-0 at Bolton - they had been unbeaten in 16 such matches.\nThe Red Devils have now lost at all three of the stadiums they've played at for the first time in the Premier League this season (John Smith's Stadium, Wembley and the Amex).\nIt the first time they had lost three matches against newly promoted sides in a league season since 1989-90 - as well as the first time ever losing all three away from home.\nWhat's next?\nBrighton will be glad their safety has been secured as they visit Premier League champions Manchester City on Wednesday (20:00 BST). United go to David Moyes' West Ham, who are not safe yet, on Thursday (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 1-2 Crystal Palace\nStoke's 10-year stay in the Premier League has come to an end after they were relegated to the Championship by Crystal Palace's second-half resurgence.\nHome fans streamed out of the Bet365 Stadium immediately after Patrick van Aanholt's winner, with long-time chairman Peter Coates looking on miserably.\nThe afternoon had started far better for the hosts.\nManager Paul Lambert - appointed in January to turn the Potters around - had celebrated wildly with Xherdan Shaqiri after the midfielder's free-kick opened the scoring just before the break.\nBut James McArthur skipped clear down the left and side-footed home the leveller, before Van Aanholt pounced on Ryan Shawcross' under-hit backpass to consign Stoke to the second tier.\nThe Potters' players - who finished 13th last season - collapsed to the turf as a first top-flight relegation since 1985 sank in.\nCrystal Palace's Mamadou Sakho was one of a number of visiting players to console their opponents after the final whistle, with goalkeeper Jack Butland in tears as some of the remaining home supporters defiantly chanted their lifelong allegiance to the club.\nReaction: Stoke too big to stay down - Lambert\nCrowd loud, Stoke quiet\nBefore kick-off, a fan implored the rest of the Bet365 Stadium to do \"whatever it takes\" for victory over the public address system.\nThe crowd responded with incessant noise, but - for the vast majority of the match - the Stoke attack was too quiet.\nAs so often, it was only when Shaqiri got on the ball that the hosts looked able to unpick the opposition defence.\nThe Switzerland international's cross was headed weakly wide by Mame Biram Diouf in Stoke's best chance before his free-kick found the net with the game's first shot on target.\nThe 26-year-old's pass should have put Badou Ndiaye clean through on goal in the second half, but the Senegal midfielder miscontrolled when a settling second goal beckoned for Stoke.\nShaqiri has spoken this season of a \"lack of quality\" among his team-mates\n, external\nand was planning talks with the Stoke management in the summer regardless of whether the club had stayed up.\nFormerly of Inter Milan and Bayern Munich, he will surely be playing top-flight football somewhere next season, with the likes of England international Butland and Wales midfielder Joe Allen also likely to exit.\nAll the reaction after Stoke are relegated\nThe big-money missing men\nStoke's demise is even more damning on those who do not share the teamsheet with Shaqiri.\nRecord signing Giannelli Imbula has spent the campaign on loan at French strugglers Toulouse.\nDefender Kevin Wimmer, bought last summer for \u00a318m, has been dropped down to the club's under-23 side, where he is joined by out-of-favour \u00a312m striker Saido Berahino.\nLambert's midfield options on the bench consisted of the ageing trio of Darren Fletcher, Charlie Adam and Stephen Ireland.\nThe club have not lacked for funds from Coates, but too many of their big-money purchases have been missing in inaction.\nPalace safe with time to spare\nIt was a result that mathematically confirmed Crystal Palace's place in the Premier League next season, even if survival had become increasingly clear through an unbeaten April.\nConsidering the visitors' start to the season, it will also ensure an almighty final-day party at the always-boisterous Selhurst Park.\nPalace lost their first seven league matches this season without scoring a single goal.\nThe appointment of Roy Hodgson in September was greeted with doubts by many whose most recent memory of the 70-year-old was leading England's calamitous Euro 2016 campaign.\nBut he has shored up the Eagles' defence while, less predictably, giving the likes of Wilfried Zaha and Ruben Loftus-Cheek the freedom to pose a threat at the opposite end.\nIn the final, wide-open exchanges, the visitors looked more likely to add to the scoreline than the hosts salvage their survival chances.\nMan of the match - James McArthur (Crystal Palace)\n'We never had enough' - what they said\nStoke manager Paul Lambert, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It is a tough afternoon. I am feeling for everyone connected with the club.\n\"When teams don't get results you can be sleep-walking into positions you don't want to be in. We never had enough. Since I came in the lads have given everything, but we came short. It is a chance to rebuild.\n\"It is difficult to come in mid-January to try to assess the team and I had a chat with the players on what went wrong.\n\"No-one can point a finger at the effort of the players.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"After seven games, or after 11 games with four points, I never saw it coming.\n\"I was hoping it would be a low-scoring year in terms of points for the lower sides and we'd just scrape over the line.\n\"But we came here basically safe. I couldn't see us going down with 38 points, so I think it was a great show of character from us to come here and play really well.\n\"It's not easy having that euphoria from last week and then to come to a place like this, where they're fighting for their lives, and put on a performance like we did.\"\nPalace pull off century-old escape act\nCrystal Palace are the first top-flight team since Liverpool in the 1899-1900 season to avoid relegation despite losing their first seven matches of the season.\nSince beating Huddersfield in his first Premier League match in charge, the Potters have collected just seven points from 13 games under Lambert.\nCrystal Palace have not lost any of their past 13 Premier League games against sides starting the day in the bottom half of the division, winning eight.\nOf players with at least 15 Premier League goals, no player has scored a higher percentage from outside the box than Shaqiri (67%, level with former Newcastle and Tottenham winger David Ginola).\nStoke have failed to win any of the four Premier League matches they have been leading at half-time under Lambert.\nBy contrast, Crystal Palace have won three of their past seven Premier League games they have trailed at the break.\nWhat's next\nStoke head to Swansea on Sunday, 13 May for their final Premier League game for at least a year, while Palace take on West Brom at the same time."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur\nJake Livermore's last-gasp goal gave West Brom a victory against Tottenham which ensures they still have a chance of avoiding Premier League relegation.\nLivermore forced the ball over the line in the 91st minute with relegation certain had they lost or drawn at The Hawthorns.\nJust hours later, the Baggies were seconds from relegation again when Southampton were denied victory over Everton by a 96th-minute Tom Davies' equaliser.\nA Saints win would have sent West Brom down but they can still stay up if a series of results go their way.\nWest Brom beat Tottenham - as it happened\nRelive all of Saturday's action\nIn a first half of few clear-cut chances, Harry Kane had the best of Spurs' opportunities and his header from Erik Lamela's cross was saved by Ben Foster.\nWest Brom's Jay Rodriguez went close as half-time approached, sneaking in behind Victor Wanyama only for his header to be cleared off the line.\nKane nearly became the Baggies' hero when a mis-hit clearance almost flew into the back of his own net with Hugo Lloris acrobatically keeping it out.\nTottenham's Danny Rose and West Brom's Allan Nyom were both booked following a second-half altercation, with Nyom's team-mates desperately trying to keep the defender calm to avoid a red card in the aftermath.\nAnd The Hawthorns exploded when Livermore found the back of the net after a scramble from a corner.\nWhat needs to happen for West Brom to stay up?\nIt would be one of the greatest ever survival stories, against all the odds.\nThere is only one way West Brom can stay up, and this is how.\nOn Tuesday, Swansea and Southampton must draw in their meeting in Wales, and on the final day of the season on Sunday, 13 May Swansea must lose at home to Stoke and Southampton must be beaten at home to Manchester City.\nWest Brom have to win at Crystal Palace in their final match and the Baggies must improve their goal difference to be better than Southampton's.\nMoore gives Baggies glimmer of hope\nWhatever the outcome at the end of the season, it has largely been a dismal campaign for West Brom. But because of their side's resurgence in recent weeks, it's one the fans won't forget in a hurry.\nCaretaker boss Darren Moore has given them a glimmer of hope since taking over at the start of April when the Baggies were 10 points from safety with six games remaining.\nWest Brom's season had started promisingly, when they picked up seven points from their opening three games, but it wasn't until mid-January - 20 games later - that they picked up their next win.\nBy that point, they were 19th in the table and Alan Pardew was eight games into his brief reign following Tony Pulis' sacking.\nIt was only when Moore was made caretaker boss that their season turned around, although it might still be too late.\nA 1-0 win at Manchester United on 15 April was the second of a four-game unbeaten streak that also included a draw with Liverpool and victory over Newcastle.\nSaturday's win over Tottenham was the most thrilling - an astonishing lesson in never giving up when all seemed lost.\nMissed opportunity for Spurs\nThis could, and perhaps should, have been a routine win for Tottenham, but they found themselves up against a resolute West Brom defence.\nThough they enjoyed a huge 74% of possession during the match, chances on goal were few with only two shots on target in the first half.\nVictor Wanyama had one of those, a curling effort sent towards Foster's top left corner, and it was the goalkeeper's agility that kept West Brom in the game.\nKane went close on multiple occasions, including a fluffed chance when in scoring territory, and his missed opportunities may well have cost him the Golden Boot with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah four goals clear in the standings.\nTottenham's Champions League place for 2018-19 is not guaranteed either. Had they beaten West Brom and Chelsea lost to Liverpool on Sunday, their place in the top four would have been confirmed but they must wait with five points separating the Blues and Mauricio Pochettino's men.\nMan of the match - Chris Brunt (West Brom)\n'We wanted to get some pride and commitment back' - what they said\nWest Brom caretaker manager Darren Moore: \"It was a pulsating game, up against a very good team who asked us a lot of questions. We trusted the commitment of the players and needed to play a tight game because of the quality Spurs possess. It worked in the end and we got the goal.\n\"We have been on this road for four, nearly five weeks. We wanted to get some pride and commitment back. The supporters have been excellent. I am the one up here but it is we as a football club - the supporters, staff and officials - and through hard work and commitment results are coming.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"Of course I am disappointed. We are in a race to be in the top four and play in the Champions League next season and that defeat disappoints us. It is certainly a bad feeling after the game.\n\"We dominated the game. We created enough chances but didn't score. In the end West Brom have quality and physical condition at set pieces and can create problems for any team. If you do not score you put at risk the game.\n\"I am not upset or angry, only disappointed because we created chances and did not score. We need to be clinical.\"#\nBBC pundit Martin Keown on Match of the Day: \"West Brom were compact, well organised, disciplined and focused.\n\"The manager has to take an enormous amount of credit. They were trying to force Tottenham wide and had some magnificent defending. They're well drilled and look a completely different animal.\n\"The two central defenders were pillars. When they did get in Dawson was there and he was immense.\n\"They took responsibility and communicated. Spurs just couldn't find a way through. Where were Spurs leaders? West Brom peppered them. They wouldn't be denied. You could see what it meant to them.\n\"Fair play - the spirit is back within that football club.\"\nThe stats\nTottenham have lost 20 Premier League games thanks to goals scored in the 90th minute or later, more than any other side in the competition.\nWest Brom are unbeaten in their past five Premier League games (W3 D2) - only Liverpool (six) are on a longer current run in the competition.\nThe Baggies are the only non-'big six' side to avoid defeat against two 'big six' sides in the Premier League this season (W1 D1 v Spurs, D2 v Liverpool).\nIndeed, West Brom have won 10 points against big six sides in the Premier League this season - only Man City (24), Man Utd (19) and Spurs (13) have won more.\nSpurs failed to score for the first time in 24 Premier League games, since a 2-0 loss at Arsenal in November.\nJake Livermore has scored two goals in his past three Premier League games for West Brom, after failing to score in his first 46 for the club.\nIndeed, Livermore's strike was West Brom's only shot on target in this match."

They are 13th, but only six points above Southampton in 18th, who have three games left to play.\nThe Hornets' biggest problem has been in front of goal; they have scored nine times in 13 matches under Javi Gracia. Four of those goals came in one game - a memorable 4-1 win over Chelsea on 5 February.\nAndre Gray, with four goals in 31 matches since an \u00a318.5m move from Burnley last August, should have done better with a low strike that was comfortably saved.\nSpurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris also produced a fine one-handed save to deny Richarlison, who later wasted a glorious chance when he blasted over from six yards out after substitute Troy Deeney's knockdown. In injury-time, Lloris secured another clean sheet for him with a fine save to block Andre Carillo's powerful strike.\nWatford sacked former boss Marco Silva in January with the club 10th in the table, but on a run of only one win in 11 games after the Portuguese coach had been repeatedly linked with the managerial position at Everton.\nGracia led Watford to an initial upturn in form, with 10 points from his first five league games, although they have picked up two points from seven matches since then.\nA finish of 13th two seasons ago did not keep Quique Sanchez Flores in his job, nor was 17th enough last season to save Walter Mazzarri, and Gracia's future at the club is looking insecure after only 13 games in charge.\nThe Hornets' last two games are at home against Newcastle on Saturday, 5 May before an away game at FA Cup finalists Manchester United on the final day of the season and Watford need two points to mathematically guarantee their Premier League status.\nSpurs keep scoring run going - the stats\nTottenham have scored in each of their past 23 Premier League games, their longest scoring run in the top flight since April 1987 (26 games).\nWatford have gone seven Premier League away games without scoring (drew one, lost six), since Andre Gray found the net against Manchester City on 2 January.\nHarry Kane made his 150th appearance in the Premier League. In those games Kane has netted 105 goals; only Alan Shearer managed more in his first 150 in the competition (121).\nChristian Eriksen has been directly involved in nine goals in his past eight games in all competitions (five goals, four assists).\nEriksen (10 goals, 10 assists) is the third Spurs player to register 10-plus goals and 10-plus assists in a single Premier League season, after Jurgen Klinsmann in 1994-95 and Emmanuel Adebayor in 2011-12.\nDele Alli has been involved in seven goals in his past seven games for Spurs in all competitions (five goals, two assists).\nWatford are the only side to have more than one goalkeeper make an error leading to goal this season in the Premier League (two each for Heurelho Gomes and Orestis Karnezis).\nKieran Trippier has notched one goal and five assists in his six top-flight appearances against Watford.\nMan of the match - Kieran Trippier (Tottenham)\n'There was tension in the stadium' - analysis\nFormer Tottenham and England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on BBC Radio 5 live\nIt was job done for Tottenham, but it wasn't the most vintage performance. There was a lot of tension in the stadium and that transmitted to the players.\nThere were a few dodgy touches and passing was not on the money. They got three points, which is the most important thing.\nThey had Chelsea slowly creeping up on them too, so they now have an opportunity to start looking upwards rather than behind them.\nWatford are a bunch of individuals; they get broken down too easily. Without that togetherness, they leak goals. In midfield, they are either brilliant or shocking, and those inconsistencies are baffling fans.\n'Lloris was great' - what they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"Hugo Lloris showed he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, he was great.\"\nOn Harry Kane, Pochettino added: \"He is working hard to try to recover his real performance. For him to score 105 goals in 150 games is very good.\n\"He is chasing [Mohamed Salah] but the most important thing is to score goals for the team.\"\nWatford manager Javi Gracia told BBC Sport: \"I think we had a good performance.\n\"We created many chances in the first half, we did not score and Tottenham with their first chance scored. It was very tough after that to try to get the points.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham play at bottom-of-the-table West Brom on Saturday, 5 May (15:00 BST), while Watford entertain Newcastle United at the same time."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-2 West Ham United\nManager David Moyes says he \"wants to look up the table\" after his West Ham team secured their Premier League status with a comfortable victory at Leicester.\nMark Noble's stunning volley capped a dominant performance from the visitors, who opened the scoring through Joao Mario.\n\"I feel as if I want to look up the table and win the last two games,\" Moyes said.\n\"The team is more than capable of winning lots of games. We defended better than we did in other games which gave us a good chance.\"\nAnd with the Hammers now on 38 points and holding an unassailable five-point advantage over Swansea and Southampton, who play each other on Tuesday, the West Ham manager has cause for optimism.\nMaximum points from their two remaining fixtures against Manchester United and Everton could bring mid-table finish.\nIt was a disappointing afternoon for the hosts, who wrapped up the Premier League title two years ago this week.\nThe Foxes' meek surrender leaves them ninth after a fourth defeat in five games and is also likely to intensify pressure on manager Claude Puel, who was given a vote of confidence by the club's owners on Friday.\n\"Sometimes there's tough periods without a good performance. It's normal that we can have some negative activity,\" said Puel, whose team were booed off at half-time.\n\"It's not the time to discuss about the summer. Now it's just to try and finish the last two games.\"\nAll the reaction to Saturday's Premier League action\nSafety confirmed for West Ham\nA combination of West Ham's win and results elsewhere confirmed that their Premier League place had been preserved.\nSwansea's defeat at Bournemouth coupled with Southampton's draw at Everton in the late Saturday kick-off, meant that the Hammers could not be caught.\nGoing into Saturday's contest, Moyes' team had won one match in eight but looked resolute in defence and showed a sense of urgency the hosts were unable to match.\nNoble exemplified their efforts, urging his team-mates forward at every opportunity and covering more ground that any other player (11.66km).\nHis volley was a fitting reward for his effort - though Marko Arnautovic also lauded by Moyes, played a key role.\n\"It was a great goal from Mark Noble, he epitomises much about West Ham. He's been there every week for us and he deserves it. He's got that in his locker.\n\"Marko Arnautovic has been terrific since I came in. He's always close to a goal. All season I've been really pleased with him.\"\nWhile the Austrian did not add to his tally of 10 league goals but his presence was felt by the home defence all afternoon.\nHe teed up on-loan Inter Milan midfielder Mario for the opening goal - but was perhaps fortunate to escape a harsher punishment when his flailing arm caught Harry Maguire in the first half.\nPressure on Puel?\nLeicester started this fixture still capable of catching Everton and earning a top-eight finish for only the second time since the 1999-00 season.\nHowever, another limp display extended a dismal sequence of results that has included two victories in 12 outings.\nPuel's hand was admittedly limited given he was hampered by injuries and suspensions.\nYet even without nine senior players he would surely have hoped for greater urgency and fight from his players with owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha present in the stands.\n\"It was a tough game for us,\" Puel said.\n\"We started without a lot of confidence because we had young players played and things like referee's decisions can give a boost to the other team.\"\nHad Aaron Cresswell been dismissed for deliberately grabbing the ball after falling over with Jamie Vardy set to run clear on goal with the score at 1-0, the momentum of the game may have shifted back towards his team.\nHis future, though, remains a matter of conjecture despite a club statement offering the owner's full support on Friday.\nMan of the match - Mark Noble (West Ham)\nFirst win at Leicester since 2000 - the stats\nLeicester are without a win in six home Premier League games, their longest such streak since a run of six ending on 26 December 2014.\nWest Ham registered their first clean sheet in their past nine top-flight away games.\nThe Foxes have lost four of their past five league games (D1), as many defeats as they had suffered in their previous 13.\nWest Ham have scored in their past 11 away league games - their longest scoring run in the top flight since December 1966 (14 games).\nLeicester have failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February 2017.\nArnautovic has been directly involved in nine goals in his past eight away league games for West Ham.\nNoble scored his 37th Premier League goal - only two players have scored more for West Ham (Paolo di Canio 47, Carlton Cole 41), with Trevor Sinclair also on 37.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester welcome Arsenal to King Power Stadium on Wednesday, 9 May (19:45 BST), while West Ham host Manchester United on 10 May at London Stadium (19:45)."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur\nJake Livermore's last-gasp goal gave West Brom a victory against Tottenham which ensures they still have a chance of avoiding Premier League relegation.\nLivermore forced the ball over the line in the 91st minute with relegation certain had they lost or drawn at The Hawthorns.\nJust hours later, the Baggies were seconds from relegation again when Southampton were denied victory over Everton by a 96th-minute Tom Davies' equaliser.\nA Saints win would have sent West Brom down but they can still stay up if a series of results go their way.\nWest Brom beat Tottenham - as it happened\nRelive all of Saturday's action\nIn a first half of few clear-cut chances, Harry Kane had the best of Spurs' opportunities and his header from Erik Lamela's cross was saved by Ben Foster.\nWest Brom's Jay Rodriguez went close as half-time approached, sneaking in behind Victor Wanyama only for his header to be cleared off the line.\nKane nearly became the Baggies' hero when a mis-hit clearance almost flew into the back of his own net with Hugo Lloris acrobatically keeping it out.\nTottenham's Danny Rose and West Brom's Allan Nyom were both booked following a second-half altercation, with Nyom's team-mates desperately trying to keep the defender calm to avoid a red card in the aftermath.\nAnd The Hawthorns exploded when Livermore found the back of the net after a scramble from a corner.\nWhat needs to happen for West Brom to stay up?\nIt would be one of the greatest ever survival stories, against all the odds.\nThere is only one way West Brom can stay up, and this is how.\nOn Tuesday, Swansea and Southampton must draw in their meeting in Wales, and on the final day of the season on Sunday, 13 May Swansea must lose at home to Stoke and Southampton must be beaten at home to Manchester City.\nWest Brom have to win at Crystal Palace in their final match and the Baggies must improve their goal difference to be better than Southampton's.\nMoore gives Baggies glimmer of hope\nWhatever the outcome at the end of the season, it has largely been a dismal campaign for West Brom. But because of their side's resurgence in recent weeks, it's one the fans won't forget in a hurry.\nCaretaker boss Darren Moore has given them a glimmer of hope since taking over at the start of April when the Baggies were 10 points from safety with six games remaining.\nWest Brom's season had started promisingly, when they picked up seven points from their opening three games, but it wasn't until mid-January - 20 games later - that they picked up their next win.\nBy that point, they were 19th in the table and Alan Pardew was eight games into his brief reign following Tony Pulis' sacking.\nIt was only when Moore was made caretaker boss that their season turned around, although it might still be too late.\nA 1-0 win at Manchester United on 15 April was the second of a four-game unbeaten streak that also included a draw with Liverpool and victory over Newcastle.\nSaturday's win over Tottenham was the most thrilling - an astonishing lesson in never giving up when all seemed lost.\nMissed opportunity for Spurs\nThis could, and perhaps should, have been a routine win for Tottenham, but they found themselves up against a resolute West Brom defence.\nThough they enjoyed a huge 74% of possession during the match, chances on goal were few with only two shots on target in the first half.\nVictor Wanyama had one of those, a curling effort sent towards Foster's top left corner, and it was the goalkeeper's agility that kept West Brom in the game.\nKane went close on multiple occasions, including a fluffed chance when in scoring territory, and his missed opportunities may well have cost him the Golden Boot with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah four goals clear in the standings.\nTottenham's Champions League place for 2018-19 is not guaranteed either. Had they beaten West Brom and Chelsea lost to Liverpool on Sunday, their place in the top four would have been confirmed but they must wait with five points separating the Blues and Mauricio Pochettino's men.\nMan of the match - Chris Brunt (West Brom)\n'We wanted to get some pride and commitment back' - what they said\nWest Brom caretaker manager Darren Moore: \"It was a pulsating game, up against a very good team who asked us a lot of questions. We trusted the commitment of the players and needed to play a tight game because of the quality Spurs possess. It worked in the end and we got the goal.\n\"We have been on this road for four, nearly five weeks. We wanted to get some pride and commitment back. The supporters have been excellent. I am the one up here but it is we as a football club - the supporters, staff and officials - and through hard work and commitment results are coming.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"Of course I am disappointed. We are in a race to be in the top four and play in the Champions League next season and that defeat disappoints us. It is certainly a bad feeling after the game.\n\"We dominated the game. We created enough chances but didn't score. In the end West Brom have quality and physical condition at set pieces and can create problems for any team. If you do not score you put at risk the game.\n\"I am not upset or angry, only disappointed because we created chances and did not score. We need to be clinical.\"#\nBBC pundit Martin Keown on Match of the Day: \"West Brom were compact, well organised, disciplined and focused.\n\"The manager has to take an enormous amount of credit. They were trying to force Tottenham wide and had some magnificent defending. They're well drilled and look a completely different animal.\n\"The two central defenders were pillars. When they did get in Dawson was there and he was immense.\n\"They took responsibility and communicated. Spurs just couldn't find a way through. Where were Spurs leaders? West Brom peppered them. They wouldn't be denied. You could see what it meant to them.\n\"Fair play - the spirit is back within that football club.\"\nThe stats\nTottenham have lost 20 Premier League games thanks to goals scored in the 90th minute or later, more than any other side in the competition.\nWest Brom are unbeaten in their past five Premier League games (W3 D2) - only Liverpool (six) are on a longer current run in the competition.\nThe Baggies are the only non-'big six' side to avoid defeat against two 'big six' sides in the Premier League this season (W1 D1 v Spurs, D2 v Liverpool).\nIndeed, West Brom have won 10 points against big six sides in the Premier League this season - only Man City (24), Man Utd (19) and Spurs (13) have won more.\nSpurs failed to score for the first time in 24 Premier League games, since a 2-0 loss at Arsenal in November.\nJake Livermore has scored two goals in his past three Premier League games for West Brom, after failing to score in his first 46 for the club.\nIndeed, Livermore's strike was West Brom's only shot on target in this match."

We will be ready Tuesday.\"\nEverton, who stay eighth in the table, were booed at the final whistle of their final home game of the season, and the result means they can no longer overhaul seventh-placed Burnley who have qualified for the Europa League.\nPickford denied the visitors twice in the first half, saving Charlie Austin's sweetly-struck 20-yard volley and Oriol Romeu's low deflected strike.\nEven after Yoshida's dismissal Southampton continued to threaten with Redmond's clever running causing problems for the hosts.\nBut it took a vital save by Alex McCarthy to turn away Leighton Baines' goal-bound free-kick before Davies' strike deflected in off Wesley Hoedt in added time.\nBattle to beat the drop\nThis was the last act on a dramatic day of action for the clubs fighting for Premier League survival.\nStoke's defeat by Crystal Palace ended their 10-year stay in the top flight, while Swansea's loss at Bournemouth left them still in real danger and winless in seven games.\nWest Brom had given themselves faint hope with their dramatic late win over Spurs - and went from facing certain relegation to clinging on still thanks to Everton's late goal.\nWest Ham's comfortable victory over Leicester - coupled with Southampton's draw - confirmed that David Moyes' side are safe.\nBut Huddersfield, who have 35 points, must travel to champions Manchester City on Sunday (13:30 BST), and then play Chelsea on Wednesday before hosting Arsenal on the final day.\nBoos amid Goodison unrest\nThe reverse of this fixture at St Mary's in November was one of the low points of Everton's season. That day the Toffees, under caretaker boss David Unsworth after Ronald Koeman's sacking, lost 4-1 and were 16th in the table.\nJust three days after a 5-1 defeat by Atalanta in the Europa League, it was another stark example of the malaise that prompted owner Farhad Moshiri to turn to Sam Allardyce.\nHis brief was to halt their free-fall down the league - Everton were two points from the bottom three after defeat on the South coast - and instil some organisation and resolve to a leaky defence.\nIn that regard - they remain eighth and have long been safe - the former England manager can claim to have done his job. Yet some supporters remain deeply unhappy with what they feel is his risk-averse style of football.\nThose hoping this would be the last time Allardyce was in the home dug-out distributed leaflets calling for a \"peaceful protest\" beforehand, aimed to signal they will not \"robotically accept the dross served up\".\nWhile few, if any, turned their back on this lacklustre game as suggested, there were boos at half-time following an abject first 45 minutes with only three shots on target in total.\nAllardyce's decision to replace winger Yannick Bolasie with defender Ramiro Funes Mori at the break prompted more puzzlement from some fans, but the switch to three central defenders allowed attacking full-backs Seamus Coleman and Baines to press further up the pitch.\nDespite the extra defender there was still nobody marking Redmond as he headed past Pickford at the back post, prompting even louder boos.\nAnd after a subdued performance from the hosts, Moshiri, watching in the stands, will have been left with no uncertainty over the feelings of many supporters concerning Allardyce's future.\nSouthampton buy themselves more time\nOn the day his former club Stoke City were relegated, Mark Hughes' Southampton gave themselves a lifeline in their fight to stay up.\nHughes, who was sacked by the Potters on 6 January, was close to overseeing back-to-back victories for his latest employers and leading the Saints to their first win at Goodison in 21 years before the late setback.\nHe has found it difficult to emphatically revive Southampton's fortunes since taking over from Mauricio Pellegrino in March, but victory over Bournemouth last weekend was a major boost and this result buys them more time.\nHughes admitted it \"felt like a defeat\" and blamed referee Jonathan Moss \"as he usually is 30 yards behind play\" for wrongly awarding Everton a free-kick in the build up to their goal.\nBut after the disappointment subsides he may reflect on a performance that saw his team out-play a club nine places above them in the table. The visitors created more chances and had five shots on target to Everton's three.\nBy contrast Swansea, who they must aim to beat on Tuesday, lost despite having more possession at Bournemouth and lack cutting edge in the final third.\nHughes, whose side host champions Manchester City on the final day of the season, will hope for a little more luck in Wales than they got on Merseyside.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond (Southampton)\n'An anguishing performance' - what they said\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce said: \"It was an anguishing performance to stand and watch the players.\n\"They have worked extremely hard from the day I walked into the club. But look at the record and the results they have achieved.\n\"We have nicked something out of it we didn't really deserve today. We didn't have much to play for other than to try to entertain the fans in the final home game and we haven't done that.\n\"The loss of Wayne Rooney, Theo Walcott, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin - that's a lot. But the lads who stepped in, as hard as they tried, didn't match up to the levels of those other guys.\"\nSouthampton boss Mark Hughes told BT Sport: \"We clearly haven't got what we deserved today. The referee has made a decision to give the free-kick in the corner.\n\"He allows it to be taken from a false position, then we're on the back foot, and we're down to 10 men too because of a decision he made and he has given free-kicks when our lads didn't touch them. I'm really upset with the officials.\n\"We have got something out of the game though and we are out of the bottom three.\"\nBBC pundit and former England midfielder Frank Lampard on Match of the Day: \"I understand Mark Hughes raging. Southampton worked incredibly hard, were organised and got themselves in front.\n\"Nathan Redmond wins the ball cleanly and the referee gets it wrong. It's then two mistakes because the ball isn't played from where it should be. It gives Everton one last push.\n\"Everton didn't really deserve anything from the game. Typically, when you're in the position Southampton are in, it takes a nasty deflection and it's one point instead of three.\"\nSaints' Goodison hoodoo continues - the stats\nEverton have lost just one of their 19 Premier League home games against Southampton (W13 D5).\nThe side playing at home has only lost one of the past 18 league meetings between these sides (W11 D6), with Everton picking up a 3-0 victory at St Mary's in August 2015.\nSouthampton have now dropped 21 points from winning positions this season - only West Brom have lost more (26).\nThe Toffees have lost their final home league game in just two of their past 14 seasons (W10 D2).\nEverton have conceded 55 Premier League goals this season - the last time they conceded more came during the 2003-04 campaign (57 goals conceded).\nThe Saints have now conceded 14 goals from outside of the box this campaign - the most in the division.\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to West Ham on Sunday, 13 May (15:00 BST) for their final game of the season, while Southampton face Swansea at the Liberty stadium on Tuesday (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 0-0 Huddersfield Town\nManchester City lifted the Premier League trophy amid jubilant scenes despite Huddersfield gaining a vital point in their battle to avoid relegation with a goalless draw at Etihad Stadium.\nWalking out to a guard of honour as thousands of blue and white flags fluttered in the stands, Pep Guardiola's side had been expected to collect a routine three points, as the champions faced the 16th-placed Terriers with celebration the tone of the day.\nBut City could not produce the style of football fans have become so accustomed to this season, with Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus going closest in a game of few clear-cut chances.\nAnd while Huddersfield players will have watched the trophy presentation knowing their place in the top flight is not yet secure, they produced a resolute performance worthy of a Premier League future.\nAs the final whistle sounded, City fans proved they cared little for the result on the day as they spilled on to the pitch on a special occasion for east Manchester, delaying the trophy presentation.\nIt was not quite a perfect performance for City on the podium either as the trophy was knocked off the plinth while players jumped on Yaya Toure, the veteran Ivory Coast midfielder who will depart the club at the end of the season.\nBut no harm was done as captain Vincent Kompany lifted the silverware aloft - his third Premier League title as a Man City player.\nHarder to win Premier League than La Liga or Bundesliga - Guardiola\nManchester City v Huddersfield - as it happened\nThe Terriers had done their best to spoil the party and contained City in the first half, although De Bruyne almost opened the scoring for the hosts on two occasions.\nAlex Pritchard came agonisingly close for the visitors, unleashing a drive from 25 yards out that an outstretched Ederson could only push around the post.\nThere were few obvious chances for either side after the break as Huddersfield became ever more defensive in pursuit of a precious point, Jesus heading one of City's better opportunities high over the bar as the clock approached 80 minutes.\nAnd as the nerves started to get to the Huddersfield fans, City continued to press, and almost snatched the win three minutes into stoppage time when Nicolas Otamendi's curled effort edged just wide of the post.\nA City season to remember\nWhile City's coronation may be the main talking point of the day, their record-breaking run to the title deserves another mention.\nMore records could yet fall in their final two matches of the season, against Brighton and Southampton, with only one more goal needed to equal the highest tally in a Premier League season - the 103 scored by Chelsea in the 2009-10 campaign.\nFor City fans, it is a title-winning campaign that will no doubt go down in club folklore, turning a 15-point deficit to champions Chelsea last season into a runaway success just a matter of months later.\nWith only two league defeats to his side's name, Guardiola has quickly learned key lessons from his first season in charge in English football.\nIf he undoubtedly has vast spending money at his disposal, his talent as a coach has shone through this season as he continually brought out the very best in his players while rejuvenating the old guard at the same time.\nRaheem Sterling has perhaps benefited most from the Spaniard's tutelage, having enjoyed the most consistent season of his career with 18 goals to date. Sunday was an uncharacteristically quiet day for the 23-year-old - he was one of only three home players who failed to have a shot.\nGuardiola now faces his next big challenge - bring back-to-back Premier League titles to the Etihad while making City successful on the European stage. Pull that off and he will be on the way to going down as one of the greatest managers the Premier League has seen.\nConfidence-booster for Terriers\nFor David Wagner's Huddersfield, ambitions for next season are more modest - and first they must ensure they are in the same division.\nAlmost a year ago, the Terriers were living a fairytale after securing promotion to the top flight for the first time since 1972.\nTwelve months later they are scrapping to keep that fairytale going. Victory over the champions would have guaranteed their safety - but that was always likely to stretch credulity a bit too far.\nThey were not prepared to sit back and let City revel in their glory, however. They started strongly and refused to allow their opponents to play their own way, with Aaron Mooy and Pritchard proving nuisances for the home defence.\nThey started the second half on the front foot too, and with the unlikeliest of points gained, this is a performance from which they will take confidence heading into their final two fixtures.\nThree points clear of the relegation zone, their fate is still in their own hands - but with Chelsea and Arsenal their remaining opponents, they can take nothing for granted.\nStill, relegation scraps can sometimes bring out the very best in teams under pressure and Wagner's men will have their tails up entering a big week for the club.\nMan of the match - Mathias Jorgensen (Huddersfield)\nHow Man City reacted\nManager Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports: \"England is a special place and is so tough. Today we saw it. You never know if you are going to win, but I had no doubt what I had to do.\n\"You win or lose, you have to try and do what you believe. Today was proof we can do better, 11 players were playing in the Premier League.\n\"We lost a bit of focus, but that is normal. To make back-to-back titles in this league will be tough, but we accept the challenge.\"\nCaptain Vincent Kompany, speaking to Sky Sports: \"The celebrations, this team deserves more than ever. We had many players who had been on and off this season and it has had no impact on the season and is credit to the coaching staff.\"\nDefender John Stones, speaking to Sky Sports: \"It's literally a dream come true. Me and Kyle Walker were saying it's why we came here. I never knew what it would be like to lift the title and it's a dream come true.\"\nForward Raheem Sterling, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We have done it and let's go again. Now we have lifted this, it is an amazing feeling.\"\n'The impossible is possible' - how Huddersfield reacted\nManager David Wagner, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: \"In football sometimes the impossible is possible. For sure before the game a clean sheet and getting a point looked impossible, but the players have done it and done it again.\n\"It makes this even bigger that a club of our size and circumstances, who are with no disrespect more like a League One club more than a Premier League club, can stick together and believe. That makes us special as a football club.\"\nA rare goalless day for Guardiola - the stats\nManchester City are without a home league win against Huddersfield since November 1987 (D2 L2), although this was the first such meeting since 1999.\nIndeed, that victory in 1987 was a 10-1 mauling, but City have not scored a single goal in any of their four home league matches against the Terriers since.\nMan City have only failed to score in two previous home Premier League games under Guardiola - vs Stoke in March 2017 and vs Man Utd in April 2017.\nThis was only Guardiola's 25th 0-0 draw as a manager of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, in what was his 519th game.\nHuddersfield are the first side since Chelsea in April 2014 to stop the team at the top of the table from scoring at home in the Premier League (Liverpool 0-2 Chelsea).\nThe Terriers are also the first promoted side to stop Manchester City scoring at the Etihad since Reading won 2-0 in February 2007.\nHuddersfield have failed to score in 20 of their 36 Premier League games this season. Only two sides have ever failed to score in more - Derby County (22 in 2007-08) and Leeds United (21 in 1996-97).\nIn fact, Huddersfield have been goalless in 13 Premier League away trips this season - a joint-record (also Norwich City 1994-95, Southampton 1998-99 and Middlesbrough 2002-03).\nScott Malone's 91st-minute strike was Huddersfield's first shot since the 30th minute and the first shot on target in the game since the 35th minute."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 5-0 Burnley\nArsene Wenger said his farewell to Emirates Stadium with a thrashing of Burnley to leave in the same way it all began for him as Arsenal manager 7,876 days ago - with victory.\nIn a season of discontent and occasional open rebellion, this was a day for a united front to celebrate the career of the manager who has brought so much success and style to Arsenal since starting his reign with that 2-0 win at Ewood Park in 1996.\nAnd in a campaign of disappointment that will now be viewed as the end of an era, the last hope of success snuffed out by the Europa League semi-final loss to Atletico Madrid, Wenger at least got the home send-off he so deserved - with a stylish win over Burnley.\nThe Clarets, who have a wonderful story of their own this season, were outclassed as Arsenal ran out 5-0 winners to give Wenger his 475th win in 826 Premier League games.\nThis was not the time to celebrate a single victory but to reflect on all the triumphs and pleasure Wenger has brought to Arsenal in almost 22 years, and everyone played their parts perfectly on and off the pitch. The differences of this season were set aside as the good and the great of Wenger's reign came into sharp focus.\nThe Emirates was draped in tributes to Wenger, with giant \"Merci Arsene\" banners outside the ground, while red T-shirts bearing the same slogan and the date were placed on each one of the 60,000 seats in the stadium.\nWenger, who is clearly departing with reluctance with 12 months still to run on his contract, made his entrance through a guard of honour formed by Arsenal and Burnley players, along with their manager Sean Dyche.\nAs he made his way towards the centre circle, huge applause reverberated around the arena that can stand as a monument to his footballing wisdom and financial expertise in the transfer market.\nThere have been fallow years and subsequent fall-outs with some Arsenal fans, but this was an occasion viewed through the prism of three Premier League titles - including two league and FA Cup doubles in 1997-98 and 2001-2002 - and \"The Invincibles\" season of those 38 unbeaten games in 2003-04.\nWenger's seven FA Cup wins have also earned him a place in history and many of the figures central to his achievements were here to pay their own tributes.\nMartin Keown and the great France midfield man Emmanuel Petit were backstage, and perhaps the most poignant sight of all was the return of David Dein to the Arsenal directors' box for the first time in 11 years.\nIt was a reminder of a once-unstoppable partnership between Wenger and the man who brought him to Arsenal - and perhaps things have never been quite the same since vice-chairman Dein left the board citing \"irreconcilable differences\" in 2007.\nAnd looking on from behind dark glasses was Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke, who, along with Arsenal's board, must replace the man Dein says is \"an impossible act to follow\".\nIn contrast to so much here this season, this was a day of complete satisfaction on and off the field, the sea of 60,000 red T-shirts watching a comprehensive attacking display that was Wenger's trademark from those glory days.\nAnd it was the potent strikeforce Wenger will leave behind that set up this easy win, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette establishing the platform by half-time.\nSead Kolasinac, Alex Iwobi and a second from Aubameyang wrapped up sixth place - but this was Wenger's day.\nHis name swept around the stands inside the first two minutes, swiftly followed by that of Patrick Vieira, who has been linked as a potential successor.\nThe other great names who brought glory under Wenger were also recognised in song, from Thierry Henry and Keown to Dennis Bergkamp.\nBurnley's fans sang their own tribute to Wenger, but were also quick with a cutting comeback to the adulation by singing \"You Wanted Him Sacked\" at Arsenal's fans.\nOther former Arsenal players, such as Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires, Kanu and Sol Campbell, were there to join in the emotional post-match scenes.\nNo Arsenal fans left their seats once the real celebrations began at the final whistle - although the one note of dissent came when Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick was jeered as he emerged to make presentations to retiring veteran Arsenal backroom man Vic Akers, ladies' captain Alex Scott and Per Mertesacker, who was given a final appearance before becoming the club's academy coach.\nArsenal's great statesman and double-winning goalkeeper Bob Wilson, who was goalkeeping coach when the French visionary was appointed, then paid homage to \"the greatest manager we have ever had\". His long-time assistant Pat Rice then presented Wenger with the gold Premier League trophy that was handed to the club after the Invincibles season.\nIt was then Wenger's turn to speak, and the Emirates fell silent for his final words, which started with a touch of typical Wenger class and humanity as he sent his best wishes to his old adversary and latterly friend Sir Alex Ferguson.\nWenger was receiving another presentation at Old Trafford just seven days ago, from Sir Alex Ferguson.\nListen: Wenger has been a great man for Arsenal - Wright\n'I will miss you'\nWenger, with his own giant image paraded on a floating flag behind him, spoke quietly with genuine emotion, ending with the message: \"I will miss you.\"\nA lap of honour saw Wenger being applauded with huge affection, the fractiousness of the last few months forgotten, especially by one youngster who got his wish after spending most of the afternoon holding up a placard reading: \"Arsene - please can I have your tie?\"\nWenger will cut the ties that have bound him to Arsenal at Huddersfield Town next week before this giant club starts to navigate a path away from the Wenger era.\nWith giant letters spelling out the day's main message \"Merci Arsene\" behind him, he waved one final goodbye as he disappeared down the tunnel. Now a new chapter will begin for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger.\nMan of the match - Alex Iwobi (Arsenal)\n606 and out for Wenger in north London - the stats\nThis was Arsenal Wenger's 606th and final home game in charge of Arsenal (W415 D120 L71), with this the 27th time that his team have won by five or more goals on home soil.\nIndeed, no manager has taken charge of more Premier League home games than Arsene Wenger (414), winning 286 of those. Only Sir Alex Ferguson has won more in the competition's history (305).\nArsenal will finish the season having scored 54 league goals at the Emirates, their joint-highest tally of home goals in a Premier League campaign, along with 2004-05 (54).\nSean Dyche suffered his 50th defeat as a manager in the Premier League, however only 11 of those have come this season, compared with 19 in 2014/15 and 20 in 2016-17.\nThis was Burnley's joint-heaviest defeat in the Premier League and the third time they've lost by a five-goal margin (also 0-5 v Spurs and 1-6 v Man City in 2009-10).\nThe Clarets have conceded more goals at the Emirates than any other away venue in the Premier League (13 in four games).\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang has now scored 20+ league goals in each of his last three seasons in the top five European leagues (25 in 2015-16 and 31 in 2016/17, both for Borussia Dortmund).\nAubameyang has scored seven league goals at the Emirates this term, the most of any Arsenal player in their first seven home appearances in the Premier League.\nAlexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in nine goals in his last nine games in all competitions (eight goals and one assist), while also scoring and assisting in the same game for the first time for Arsenal.\nAmong players to have scored 10+ goals in the Premier League this season, the Frenchman has scored the highest percentage of his goals in home games (79% - 11 of 14).\n'It is impossible to feel nothing' - what they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: \"It is impossible to feel nothing unless you are completely robotic.\n\"It is 22 years of total commitment and togetherness. Overall I would like to thank everybody. I had the luxury of doing this job for 22 years at the same club and I am grateful for that.\n\"It is difficult to analyse this season for what this team has done. At home it has been championship stuff, but away from home it has not been enough. We also went to the League Cup final and Europa League semi-final.\n\"The fans may be lost at the start next season, but they will have a new manager and they can continue the work as the basics are here.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to MOTD: \"I think Arsenal raised their performance considerably. After the results yesterday we suddenly had nothing to play for and that affects players, they need something on the game.\n\"Today Arsenal really turned up. It will be a different feel at home next weekend - our fans were great today and they know how good a season it has been.\n\"Arsene Wenger means a lot to the game, the only thing he'll be asking is if they could have done that more often. It's still quite fresh but in 10 years they'll probably be looking back and thinking 'what an era'.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal travel to Leicester for their penultimate game of the season on Wednesday (19:45 BST), while Burnley host Bournemouth on Sunday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool\nManager Antonio Conte said Chelsea were \"putting pressure\" on their rivals as they boosted their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League with victory over Liverpool.\nOlivier Giroud expertly headed in Victor Moses' cross in the first half after the visitors had dominated possession and failed to capitalise.\nChelsea remain in fifth but move within three points of third-placed Liverpool.\n\"We are winning and our opponents are dropping points,\" said Conte.\nWith two games remaining to Liverpool's one, Chelsea can move level on points with the Champions League finalists when they face Huddersfield on Wednesday.\nBut, given their superior goal difference, the Reds would almost certainly ensure a top-four finish with victory at home to Brighton on the final day.\n\"We had the will to win, to keep the hope alive that we can get a place in the Champions League,\" Conte added.\n\"Probably one month ago it was impossible to imagine we would arrive at the end of the season fighting for the Champions League.\n\"I don't know if this will be enough but we have to try. It's important to face this situation with a lot of pride and show we are still alive.\"\nLiverpool had more than 66% possession in the first half and created plenty of chances - the best falling to Sadio Mane, who was denied twice by Thibaut Courtois - but it was Chelsea who came closest.\nTiemoue Bakayoko's header bounced inches wide just moments before Giroud leapt high to nod home Moses' cross.\nAnd Cesc Fabregas' smart run in behind the defence created an opening which he could not convert from a tight angle.\nChelsea had the best chances of the second half too. Hazard almost danced his way through before Antonio Rudiger's header was ruled out for offside and Marcos Alonso's volley flew inches wide.\nHow did you rate the players?\nRelive how it happened\nNervous conclusion to Liverpool's top-four bid\nLiverpool looked set to secure a place in the top four last month when they comfortably beat Bournemouth 3-0 just days after knocking Manchester City out of the Champions League with a 5-1 aggregate win.\nThey were 12 points ahead of Chelsea and seemingly out of sight.\nBut back-to-back draws with West Brom and Stoke, as well as victories for Chelsea against Southampton, Burnley and Swansea, have made things difficult for Liverpool.\nIt would take a remarkable effort for Chelsea to overturn the 15-goal deficit but it could still be a nervous afternoon at Anfield on the final day of the season should Chelsea win their remaining games against Huddersfield and Newcastle.\nLiverpool have had the distraction of their remarkable run to the Champions League final but should they fail to secure a place in next year's competition, it would be a huge disappointment.\nChelsea's surge keeps hopes alive\nThis game was important for both teams but for Chelsea a win was essential to keep their top-four hopes alive.\nIt was Liverpool, however, who showed the greater urgency in the early stages - dominating possession and creating a number of half-chances through Roberto Firmino and Mane.\nThe hosts held firm and took their chance when it arrived to give them a crucial lead at the break. The goal spurred them on, too, and the Blues were the better side in the second half - with five shots to Liverpool's two.\nIt was the type of gritty performance which has helped Chelsea close in on the top four - after their comeback win against Southampton and plucky displays at Burnley and Swansea.\nAnd they deserve great credit for the way they have bounced back from a disappointing start to the year - when they had picked up just 12 points from a possible 33 before Giroud's late double helped them beat Southampton 3-2.\nTwo wins from their final two games could see them over the line if Liverpool or Tottenham drop points but, for now, it is out of their hands.\n'I hate the result' - what the managers said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"Today was a must-win game against a really good team, but it was a good game and a great show of will to keep our hope of finishing in the top four alive. I'm very happy for the players and the fans. They deserve this type of game and this win.\n\"Our target is to finish the season in the best possible way and to give the best satisfaction to all the fans. I think in spite of the difficult season we are still alive and are fighting until the end.\n\"In this league it's very tough, in the past, in the present and in the future, and it could be even more difficult in the future. You start the season with the six top teams and anything can happen.\nOn Olivier Giroud: \"He brought a personality, he's an international player with a lot of experience and we needed this kind of player. Today he played a very good game and worked very hard without the ball, but I am pleased for the whole performance of the whole team.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I hate the result but the performance was good enough to get a good point. It's clear against Chelsea you have to avoid crosses, but the cross came in and it's difficult against Giroud, and that's the goal.\n\"Chelsea were strong but we did well and had a few good moments. But we weren't clinical enough. The performance was OK but the result was exactly the opposite of what we wanted.\"\n\"They had quality and a defensive plan. They played with eight men around the ball, and two very good attacking players. The longer the game goes on, it gets more difficult. We didn't have space to cross.\"\nBogey team - the best of the stats\nLiverpool have only lost more Premier League games against Manchester United (28) than against Chelsea (20).\nThis is the first time that Liverpool have failed to score in consecutive Premier League games under Jurgen Klopp.\nAntonio Conte is the fifth manager to have faced more than 20 Premier League teams and beaten them all, after Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Gordon Strachan.\nAfter going unbeaten in each of Jurgen Klopp's first eight Premier League away games against the rest of the 'big six' (W4 D4), Liverpool have lost four of the last five (D1).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2012, Olivier Giroud has scored more headed goals than any other player in the competition (29).\nGiroud scored in a league game in which he started for the first time since May 2017 for Arsenal - each of his previous six goals in the competition had come from the bench.\nSince the turn of the Millennium, this was the 56th meeting between Chelsea and Liverpool in all competitions, making it the most played fixture between English sides in all competitions in the 21st century.\nChelsea have won four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2017.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host Huddersfield on Wednesday, 9 May (19:45 BST) before travelling to Newcastle on Sunday, 13 May (15:00 BST).\nLiverpool's final league game of the season is at home to Brighton on Sunday, 13 May (15:00 BST)."

I came in late to proceedings and needed to get a reaction out of players who had maybe lost their way somewhat. I have to say, since I've come in they've worked hard and, even when results went against us, never diminished belief.\n\"It is not mathematically certain. We had to come here and we had to win. If we had not won today it would have been very, very difficult for us. It is not done yet but tonight we have put ourselves in the position where we have a great chance to stay up.\n\"We will enjoy tonight, we got what we set out to get. A huge result, we are delighted but there's still got work to do.\"\nOn having to change hotel late on due to a 'virus':\n\"We suspected that maybe it was some of the dark arts at work but we didn't let us affect us, in fact we used it as a motivating factor. That helped our focus and we won't be staying in the vicinity of the hotel Marriott Swansea, I think we will stick to the Vale of Glamorgan.\"\nSwansea manager Carlos Carvalhal, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a push to us because the boys did everything in the game. They played with a fantastic attitude. We played more long balls than normal but it is normal in this kind of situation with the emotion. The goalkeeper made two or three fantastic saves.\n\"I will not put the fault in my players, I never do this. I assume responsibility. It is not a question that they are not good enough, we created chances. We did our maximum, the players did their maximum but we did not score for whatever reason.\n\"In this moment we are not relegated. Tomorrow, we don't know. Definitely we don't depend on ourselves.\"\nSwansea's winless run continues - the stats\nSwansea have failed to score in eight different Premier League home games this season, more than any other side.\nSeven of Southampton's last 11 away Premier League victories have been against sides starting the day in the relegation zone.\nOnly Stoke (13) are on a longer winless run in the Premier League than Swansea (8 - D3 L5).\nSwansea have failed to score in eight of their 12 Premier League clashes with Southampton, scoring just five goals in total in those matches.\nManolo Gabbiadini has netted two goals in his last four away league games for Southampton after failing to find the back of the net in the previous 12.\nGabbiadini's goal was just his fifth in his last 41 games for Southampton in all competitions, one fewer than he managed in his first four games for Saints.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea City host already relegated Stoke on Sunday 13 May (15:00 BST) while Southampton welcome the champions Manchester City to St Mary's on the same day kick-off (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 3-1 Arsenal\nLeicester earned a first Premier League win over Arsenal since 1994 as Arsene Wenger's penultimate game in charge of the Gunners ended in another away defeat.\nKelechi Iheanacho rifled the opener past Petr Cech after poor defending from the visitors, who had 20-year-old defender Konstantinos Mavropanos sent off 92 seconds later for hauling down the forward as he broke through on goal.\nArsenal levelled through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but Jamie Vardy's penalty, awarded after Henrikh Mkhitaryan brought down Demarai Gray, and Riyad Mahrez's late breakaway goal sealed victory for the hosts.\nArsenal remain the only side without an away point in English league football in 2018, while victory for the Foxes means they could still overhaul Everton for eighth place with victory over Tottenham on the final day.\nVardy's penalty means he has now scored six goals in seven Premier League games against the Gunners, who have lost seven consecutive top-flight away matches for the first time since 1966.\nIn the final minutes Arsenal fans chanted Wenger's name and were joined by the home supporters, many of whom stood to applaud the Frenchman.\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League games\nPuel gets instant response\nBefore the match, Foxes manager Claude Puel had called on his side to \"be positive, play with quality, tempo and desire\" - and they duly responded.\nThe Frenchman has been under pressure in recent weeks and received a vote of confidence from the club's board last Friday, but on this evidence he certainly appears to have his players' backing.\nFousseni Diabate and Mahrez provided constant threat down the flanks, and an attack force of Vardy and Iheanacho had Arsenal's inexperienced backline constantly troubled.\nPuel played under Wenger at Monaco in the 1980s and 1990s, and the Arsenal boss praised his tenacity before the match.\n\"He can fight,\" said Wenger. \"I had him as a player and that was the same and I'm sure he can turn it around very quickly.\"\nWenger presumably hoped Puel would have waited one more game to get it right.\nWhile this was a good night for Puel, who insists a mid-table finish is acceptable, he surely faces another challenge once the campaign ends, with the future of Mahrez certain to be on the agenda.\nIf he can retain the services of the Algerian, who has put in two transfer requests in the last two windows, and get consistent performances out of players like Iheanacho, then the champions of 2016 have reasons for optimism heading into a new season.\nGunners' grim away run continues\nIf Arsenal were going to get their first away points of the year on the road anywhere, it should have been here.\nThe last time Leicester beat Arsenal in the Premier League, John Major was Prime Minister, Forrest Gump was in cinemas and it took a David Seaman own goal and David Lowe strike to seal a 2-1 win at Filbert Street under caretaker manager Kevin MacDonald.\nFast forward 24 years and a rush of blood to the head from Arsenal youngster Mavropanos helped Leicester to an overdue victory.\nThe Gunners had to play for 81 minutes with 10 men as a result, but after a period of panic when Cech made a string of key saves, the visitors rallied.\nFoxes goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic, making his league debut for the club after arriving from Hull last summer, had to make a made a strong save to deny Mkhitaryan, while Sead Kolasinac hit the post.\nWhen Aubameyang notched his ninth goal in 12 league games since joining in January to draw Arsenal level, the game was wide open.\nBut Arsenal were missing the energy of Jack Wilshere, whose wife went into labour before the match, while Aaron Ramsey disappointed as an attacking threat with no shots on goal from midfield.\nGraham Scott's decision to award a penalty, a call disputed by Wenger, led to more away-day misery as Vardy fired home.\nAnd any hopes of rescuing a point evaporated when Mahrez's goal made it three.\nArsenal have now conceded 50 goals in a top-flight campaign for the first time since 1983-84, when they let in 60.\nVardy remains top six tormentor - the stats\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2014, Jamie Vardy has scored 24 goals against the big six sides - four more than any other player during this period (Sergio Aguero, 20).\nJamie Vardy has scored six goals in seven Premier League appearances against Arsenal; in fact, only against Liverpool has he scored more in the competition (seven).\nArsene Wenger suffered his first defeat against Leicester in his 23rd meeting with the Foxes (P23 W14 D8 L1).\nArsenal have lost seven consecutive top-flight away matches for the first time since January 1966 - the Gunners last went on a longer run of consecutive away defeats in May 1925 (a run of 13).\nThe Gunners have now lost 11 Premier League games on the road this season equalling their highest number of away defeats in a single campaign (also 11 in 1994/95) and are the only side across the top four tiers of English football yet to pick up an away point in 2018 (P7 W0 D0 L7).\nSince making his Premier League debut, only Mohamed Salah (12) has scored more goals in the competition than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (nine).\nMan of the match - Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester)\n'VAR vote destroys me' - what they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: \"Overall I believe we played a great game today. Even with 10 against 11 we should win the game. I'm convinced what changed the game was the penalty. I have complaints about the red card as well but I think we dealt well with the situation. I would like to praise the team for the spirit they showed tonight.\n\"There is always a reason for the defeat, but if you isolate each game, it is unfortunate what happened tonight. I think the Premier League has voted against VAR and it is upsetting. It destroys me because we were in front of the rest of the world, and now we want to be behind.\"\nAsked whether the result may ease the pressure on him, Leicester manager Claude Puel said: \"No comment. It is not my concern, it was just a win for the players and they wanted to give a reward to the fans. Congratulations to my players because they put in place all of the good ingredients to win the game.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester travel to Tottenham on Sunday (15:00 BST) while Arsenal head to Huddersfield for Wenger's final game at the helm (15:00 BST)."

Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte waited patiently to shake hands and congratulate every Huddersfield player.\nAfter the visitors linked arms and clapped their fans, Wagner said his team would be celebrating all the way back to Huddersfield.\n\"We have cancelled the flight and will go home by coach,\" said the German.\nThe Terriers did not have a shot on goal in the first half but took a surprise lead in the 50th minute when Laurent Depoitre finished Aaron Mooy's ball over the top.\nChelsea dominated possession but were guilty of some poor finishing.\nWe believed in the impossible - Wagner\nHow did you rate the players in Huddersfield's draw at Chelsea?\nAntonio Rudiger wasted two glorious chances before the FA Cup finalists finally equalised in fortuitous fashion - Mathias Jorgensen's clearance striking Marcos Alonso in the face before flying into the net.\nHuddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl produced a wonderful save to push Andreas Christensen's header onto the post as Chelsea searched for a winner, but the Terriers held firm to ensure a second successive season in the Premier League.\nChelsea must now win away at Newcastle on Sunday and hope Liverpool lose at home to Brighton to qualify for the Champions League.\nMeanwhile, at the bottom, Swansea must overturn a nine-goal difference on the final day of the season if they are to stay up.\nThey have to win at home to relegated Stoke and hope Southampton lose heavily at home to champions Manchester City.\nOne of the season's great success stories\nGiven they had a run-in against champions Manchester City, Chelsea - both away from home - and Arsenal, few gave Huddersfield much chance of staying up in recent weeks.\nHowever, Wagner's battlers will grace the top-flight again next year after securing an unlikely point for the second successive game.\nHaving held City to a goalless draw on Sunday, they frustrated the 2016-17 champions on Wednesday.\nWagner's side came with a plan to pack the defence and frustrate the hosts - and they executed it to near-perfection.\nHuddersfield were happy to defend deep and allow Chelsea to enjoy most of the possession.\nThere was a touch of fortune, however, that Chelsea's best two chances fell to Rudiger.\nThe Germany defender was guilty of an incredible miss from point-blank range in the 13th minute, after Cesar Azpilicueta's downward header from a corner.

The Chelsea boss has another year left on his contract but said it was up to the club to \"take the best decision\" when asked if he will still be in charge next season.\n\"We have another game to play, the FA Cup final, then the club for sure will do the best to improve the situation,\" said Conte.\nHis side brought the curtain down at home with a result which summed up their underwhelming league form.\nHaving won the title in impressive style 12 months ago, Chelsea's defence of the championship ended long ago.\nWhile they won 51 points from a possible 57 in front of their own fans last term, they managed just 37 this time after a mixed set of results which included an opening weekend defeat to Burnley and a 3-0 loss against Bournemouth on 30 January.\n\"We dropped many points this season,\" added Conte. \"I'm realistic.

We felt we have played 37 games away from home. You can say whatever you want but Wembley is not our stadium.\n\"To finish above Arsenal and Chelsea means a lot. Maybe from the outside no-one expected us to be in the top four again this season. We showed character and we showed we are strong as a team.\n\"It means more than a trophy to be honest. We can be proud of our season.\"\nMauricio Pochettino's side disappointed for much of the game against Newcastle but Kane beautifully guided a shot into the top corner from the edge of the box in the 50th minute.\nNewcastle had created the better openings in the first half with Jonjo Shelvey hitting the post from a free-kick and Jamaal Lascelles' header forcing a good save from Lloris.\nThe home fans had become increasingly frustrated before Kane's goal as Spurs continued the lacklustre form of recent weeks which had put their Champions League qualification in jeopardy.\nNewcastle continued to impress after going behind and Jacob Murphy should have equalised but he smashed his shot from inside the area over the bar moments after coming off the bench.\nKane helps Spurs limp over the line\nSpurs had taken only four points from their previous four league games and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United last month.\nThat form meant that, even with Spurs' win, the race for the top four would have gone to the final day were it not for Chelsea surprisingly dropping points at Stamford Bridge.\nPochettino's side missed half-chances and misplaced passes throughout and their only real moment of quality was Kane's goal.\nThe home fans' nervousness regarding their league position was clear with the groans in the first half and they also cheered loudly when the result at Stamford Bridge became clear.\n\"The pressure was for us and maybe it was not a great game,\" Pochettino said. \"But to finish in the top four and maybe top three, we have to be realistic and be thankful to the players for their achievement.\n\"It is a massive achievement to qualify again.\n\"Next season it will be fantastic for Tottenham to be playing in a new stadium and in the Champions League.\"\nKane himself had been wasteful, skewing a left-footed volley wide early in the first half and completely missing his kick when trying to convert when through on goal with the ball dropping over his shoulder.\nWith the World Cup just over a month away, the England striker has looked below par in recent weeks but has still scored four goals in his past six league games.\nPochettino admitted Kane was not at his best but said he will be in \"perfect condition\" at the World Cup.\nThe Englishman's goal does mean Spurs still have an outside chance of finishing second this season, if Manchester United lose their two remaining games.\nNewcastle prove they are not on the beach\nNewcastle have now lost four consecutive games since passing the 40-point mark by beating Arsenal in mid-April but this performance was not one of a team who were already thinking of the end of the season.\nThey defended well for the most part, with Spurs limited to just a handful of chances, and attacked with intensity.\nShelvey was unfortunate with his free-kick and Lascelles came close with his header while strikers Ayoze Perez and Dwight Gayle both had difficult chances in the first half.\nKane's clinical finish showed a top-class striker is the biggest difference between the two sides and will only add to Benitez's claims pre-match\n, external\nthat the club need to break their transfer record to sign one in the summer.\nWinger Murphy's opportunity was the clearest in the second half and manager Rafael Benitez said his side deserved more from their first visit to Wembley for 18 years.\n\"We put them under pressure,\" the Spaniard added.\n\"We were unlucky but it was a great performance. We wanted to do well. It has been a good season for us and we want to finish on a high.\n\"These games that we have lost we were not worse than the other teams. It has been the same throughout the season. The games are close. Today was another example.\"\nMan of the match - Mohamed Diame (Newcastle)\nKane loving life at Wembley - the best stats\nSpurs have won their past 18 home Premier League games against promoted sides since a 2-1 defeat to Norwich City in April 2012.\nNewcastle United have now lost four consecutive Premier League games on three different occasions this season.\nSince losing their opening Premier League home game at Wembley this season, Spurs have lost just one in the past 17 (W12 D4).\nThis was Spurs' first league double over Newcastle since 2004-05.\nAfter failing to score in his first four Premier League games at Wembley, Harry Kane has since netted 13 in his past 14 appearances.\nSon Heung-Min has been directly involved in more home goals in all competitions for Spurs this season than any other player (14 goals, 9 assists).\nSince winning 3-1 and 4-3 at Arsenal and Leeds United respectively in the space of four days in December 2001, Newcastle have won one of their 51 away Premier League matches against sides starting the day in the top four (D8 L42), a 1-0 win at Arsenal in November 2010.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Leicester on the final day while Newcastle are also home against Chelsea (both 15:00 BST kick-offs)."

Their 31 victories in 37 games passes the 30 registered by Chelsea last term and equals the all-time top-flight record set by Tottenham's double-winning team of 1960-61.\nHowever, Guardiola suggested his side need to win more trophies before comparisons can be drawn between his side and the great Liverpool teams of the 1980s or Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United sides.\n\"To be considered one of the best, you have to win more. To be alongside United in the 1990s or Liverpool in the 1980s you have to win more.\n\"I am not saying we are a legend team, I am not saying we are better than them. No, because you have to make more years to do that, but in one season we were better than all of them in the history of Premier League and the history of English football.\"\nOut with the old in with the new\nMuch of the evening for those in sky blue was devoted to paying tribute to Toure in his final appearance for City at the Etihad, four days before his 35th birthday.\nThe midfielder's name was replaced with the word 'Legend' on the teamsheet and City supporters went through a repertoire of songs paying tribute to the Ivorian.\nAt full-time, his brother Kolo - who also played for City between 2009-2013 - emerged to the tune of 2 Unlimited's 1993 hit 'No Limit', to present his younger brother with a commemorative shirt.\nIf Toure, who has collected seven trophies since being signed by Roberto Mancini in July 2010 represents the past, Leroy Sane, a Guardiola recruit, embodies the present.\nHaving arrived from Schalke for \u00a346.5m in 2016, this has been the 22-year-old's breakthrough season in England and he was at his tricky best against the Seagulls - creating all three of City's goals.\nHis quick one-two and surge through midfield created the opener, a driving run down the left and back-post cross laid on the second and some quick thinking and a precise cut-back delivered the third.\nSane has now been directly involved in more league goals this season than any other German player in Europe's top five divisions - scoring 10 and providing 15 assists.\nTough night for Brighton\nEven facing a City side that made eight changes to their last league outing, this was always going to be a tough assignment for Brighton.\nOnly Manchester United, Everton and Huddersfield had taken points from their visit to the Etihad this term while Chris Hughton's team hold the unwanted distinction of having the second worst away record in the Premier League, after relegated Stoke.\n\"They are, I think, the best footballing side that I have seen, certainly in the Premier League,\" Hughton said.\n\"They just have an abundance and a way of playing. The biggest asset of their game is their pace and intensity, and that is both ways.\n\"When you have gifted players they might not be so good without the ball but this is a team that when they lose possession, even the gifted players they have work hard to get the ball back.\"\nAlbion, who maintained their record of not being beaten by more than two goals on their travels, remained in the game until 18 minutes from time.\nThough generally starved of possession, French winger Anthony Knockaert was a threat throughout and could have restored parity but it was always a case of their work being completed before this evening.\nThe Seagulls guaranteed their Premier League status with a win over Manchester United last week at the Amex, where seven wins and 29 points from their 19 games has proven enough to accomplish their primary aim.\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Manchester City)\nToure captains City for first time since 2016 - the stats\nMan City now hold the outright record for most goals in a single Premier League campaign (105) - overtaking Chelsea's total of 103 goals in the 2009-10 season.\nPep Guardiola's side have won 31 Premier League games this season - the most in single campaign in the competition. In fact, they've equalled the all-time English top-flight record for most wins in a single campaign (31, Tottenham in 1960-61).\nCity have won 97 points in 2017-18, the most by a Premier League team in a single season. Furthermore, City's 97 points is only bettered in the English top-flight by Liverpool's haul of 98 in 1978-79 (adjusting 3 pts for a win).\nCity have conceded in seven of their last eight Premier League home games against newly-promoted sides - only keeping a clean sheet against Huddersfield at the weekend.\nIn eight previous league visits to Man City, the Seagulls have failed to win any (D2 L6), although this was their first visit to the Etihad.\nLeonardo Ulloa scored his first league goal for Brighton in 1467 days, last netting for the Seagulls against Nottingham Forest in May 2014.\nLeroy Sane has been directly involved in more league goals this season than any other German player in Europe's big five divisions (10 goals, 15 assists).\nSane is the fourth player to have registered a hat-trick of assists in a Premier League match this season, and third for Man City (Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and Henrikh Mkhitaryan).\nYaya Toure started a Premier League game as captain for Manchester City for the first time since April 2016 (vs Stoke).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to St Mary's to face Southampton in their final league game of the season on Sunday 13 May (kick-off 15:00 BST).

Manchester United are the same.\n\"The top four is obviously important but it's better to finish second than fourth and it's better to be second for months and months and months than losing that position and that control.\n\"We don't celebrate second position but we are happy because for a few months, we realised it was impossible to win the league and, of course, the target is the second position.\nLawro's final day Premier League predictions v Tracey Neville\nWatch: World Cup countdown - Hagi's famous strike\nListen: 'Everton might be better off without Rooney & Allardyce'\nDavid Moyes' side remain 15th in the table after securing their survival against Leicester last week.\nDespite West Ham's attempts to generate an atmosphere at the London Stadium for this fixture - by adding huge concourse motifs of their former captains and record breakers - there were a large number of empty seats.\nAnd the game was reflective of an end-of-season affair, with the only moment of note in the later stages being a confrontation between both sets of players following Pogba's foul on Noble.\n\"It was hardly worth talking about [the incident at the end]. The referee handled it well,\" said Moyes after the West Ham captain appeared to grab the French midfielder by the neck in a scuffle.\nReferee Jon Moss booked both players, who were on friendly terms by the final whistle.\n\"I was watching the images and Paul and Noble looked in love. Hugs and kisses and changing shirts (at full-time). It was good. It was competitive,\" said Mourinho.\nAudition for Wembley?\nWhile unwanted results in this fixture [a defeat and a draw] contributed to United missing out on top-flight titles in 1992 and 1995, there was no such importance placed upon this encounter.\nWith Manchester City confirmed as champions on 15 April, United required a point to seal a second-place finish and manager Mourinho instead appeared to use the fixture as an audition for a place in his FA Cup final line-up against Chelsea on 19 May.\nDeploying a three-man defence, the Portuguese boss made eight changes to his starting XI from the one that lost at Brighton, reintroducing the likes of Phil Jones, Alexis Sanchez and Luke Shaw.\nCaptain Antonio Valencia created United's best opportunity of the first period, which Hammers goalkeeper Adrian expertly parried from Sanchez before brilliantly deflecting Shaw's blistering follow-up onto the post.\nEngland midfielder Jesse Lingard also restated his case for inclusion at Wembley with a lively performance that carried threat without goals - Adrian repelling three of his efforts.\nAs the minutes ticked down, United appeared to settle for their point instead of chasing all three.\nIsolated Arnautovic\nAfter ensuring the club's Premier League survival at Leicester, Moyes said he wanted West Ham \"to look up the table\" as he sought to end the season with a potential - but unlikely - top-10 finish.\nVictory would have drawn West Ham level with Newcastle in 10th place - albeit with a significantly worse goal difference - but the hosts struggled to match such ambition as they exhibited the symptoms of a team that has failed to win consecutive Premier League fixtures since January 2017.\nDespite the best efforts of Marko Arnautovic, who has delivered 10 goals since being converted into a central striker earlier in the campaign, the Hammers struggled to impose themselves.\n\"Our boys showed a great attitude after getting safe at the weekend,\" Moyes said.\n\"We have conceded a lot of goals this season so a clean sheet is great. At this stage of the season you don't get great games.\n\"Declan Rice played very well tonight, the boys at the back did a good job. With a bit more care we would have scored on the break.\"\nAustrian international Arnautovic appeared to have the better of United defender Chris Smalling from the moment he turned past him in the seventh minute and fired straight at United goalkeeper David De Gea from 20 yards.\nAnd while that narrative continued, he too often cut an isolated figure as West Ham's attacking threat amounted to just two shots on target and one corner in 90 minutes.\nMan of the match - Adrian (West Ham)\nMourinho maintains record over Moyes - the stats\nManchester United have guaranteed second place in the Premier League, their highest position since winning the league in 2012-13.\nThe Reds have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League side this season (18).\nWest Ham kept only their third home Premier League clean sheet against Man Utd in 22 matches against them (also August 1998 and December 2006).\nJose Mourinho has managed more matches against David Moyes without losing (13 - W8 D5) than against any other manager in his managerial career.\nManchester United have won just five of their last 18 away Premier League matches in London (D4 L9).\nSince Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of the 2012-13 season, no Premier League team has drawn more matches nil-nil than Manchester United (19, level with Southampton).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham welcome Everton to the London Stadium on Sunday 13 May (15:00 BST) for their final game of the season.

He was embraced by several of his team-mates, and Mourinho.\nRelive United's win and Carrick's final game\nMan City were behind in games for just 153 minutes this season - final-day stats round-up\nMartial a doubt for Man Utd in FA Cup final, but Lukaku is fit\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nCarrick shows what United will miss\nCarrick joined United from Tottenham in 2006 for \u00a318m and has won five Premier League titles and the Champions League.\nBut appearances in the final season of his 19-year playing career have been limited by an irregular heart rhythm - this was just his fifth match of the campaign, and first since February.\nNevertheless, he showed what United will miss in his absence - making the most passes and having the most touches of any Red Devils player.\nSitting deep in midfield, he was calm in possession and mopped up any trouble at the back, before trying to start counter-attacks.\nHis pass to Mata was trademark Carrick, and United will need to spend in the summer to find a suitable replacement.\nCarrick told BBC Sport: \"It was very special. I had mixed emotions as I have not played a lot of football this year and wanted to win the game going into next week.\n\"I will just cherish the memories. The reception I got will live with me for the rest of my days, and having the kids and my family with me adds up to something special.\n\"It is not a sad farewell or goodbye, I am looking forward to next week for starters and we will take it from there.\"\nSecond is best finish since Ferguson retired\nIt is hard to take much from United's performance, with Mourinho making nine changes from the midweek draw at West Ham.\nDespite Rashford's presence they lacked pace and urgency, and must hope it is a different story when they face Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday.\nRashford's goal was one of only two moments of excitement in an otherwise soporific first half, the other coming when United goalkeeper Sergio Romero made a stunning one-handed save to deny Richarlison just before the break.\nThe second half was little better, with both teams causing few problems.\nVictory meant United ended the season on 81 points and in second place, their highest finish since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\nPrior to the match there were question marks over the absence of France forward Anthony Martial, who Mourinho had said would start the game.\nIt was later revealed he injured his left knee in training, and Mourinho said he is a big doubt for the FA Cup final.\nGracia hoping to stay at Watford\nWatford have finished 14th in their third season back in the top flight, an improvement from 17th 12 months earlier.\nMarco Silva was sacked in January with the club 10th in the table, with Javi Gracia subsequently winning four, drawing three and losing seven of his 14 league games in charge.\nA 4-1 defeat of Chelsea in February was a rare highlight for Gracia, who hopes to stay at Vicarage Road.\nAsked if he would still be in the role next season, the 48-year-old Spaniard said: \"Yes, I think so.\n\"I've already spoken many times with the owner. I can feel he is ambitious. I don't know what happens in the future with different movements but I'm sure he will try to improve the squad for next season.\"\nOne of the few bright spots for Watford was the return of midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah, who made his first appearance since September after a knee injury.\nMan of the match - Michael Carrick\nStats - United are clean sheet kings\nUnited won all 21 of their Premier League matches this season when they scored first, only the second team to achieve this in a Premier League season (also Portsmouth in 2007-08).\nWatford are now goalless in each of their eight away Premier League games - their run stretches to 728 minutes on the road.\nUnder Javi Gracia, the Hornets have attempted 61 shots in away Premier League games without scoring.\nRashford has been involved in 17 goals in his past 18 starts at Old Trafford in all competitions (nine goals, eight assists).\nCarrick made his 481st and final Premier League appearance - this was his first start in the competition for 364 days (14 May 2017 against Spurs).\nRomero has kept six clean sheets in seven Premier League matches for United.\nSince the start of last season, United have kept more Premier League clean sheets than any other team (36)."

I wasn't able to convey that determination to my players.\"\nA barrage at goal from the hosts forced visiting goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to make sharp saves from the impressive Jonjo Shelvey and Mohamed Diame.\nBut Ayoze Perez poked home twice in the second period as his side finished the season in 10th position.\nChelsea's best chance fell to striker Olivier Giroud, but the Frenchman's acrobatic effort was tipped away by goalkeeper Martin Dubravka.\nThey have the opportunity to end the season on a positive note in next Saturday's FA Cup final against Manchester United (kick-off 17:15 BST).\nAfter the game, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley released a statement thanking boss Rafael Benitez for his \"magnificent achievement\", saying he hoped the Spaniard would remain at the club.\nRelive Newcastle's brilliant win over Chelsea\nFinal-day stats round-up\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nAntonio Gon-te?\nChelsea last played in the Europa League in the 2012-13 season, when they won the trophy under the guidance of Benitez.\nBut the 2016-17 champions end this campaign four places, 23 points and 23 goals worse off than last year.\nThere has been much speculation about Conte's future at Stamford Bridge and if it does prove to be his last league game, the Italian went out with a whimper.\nHis side failed to register a shot in the first 45 minutes and the usually passionate Italian watched on with arms folded as his side fell apart by conceding two more after half-time.\nIf Conte does leave, he will have a chance to end his Chelsea career on a high by winning the FA Cup against rival Jose Mourinho at Wembley, but his side will have to show a marked improvement from this showing.\n\"We have six days to prepare for the final of the FA Cup and we have to change,\" Conte said.\nAsked if he will still be at the club next season, he replied: \"I have a contract and I am committed to this club.\"\nGiroud did eventually test Dubravka with an instinctive shot on 52 minutes, while Ross Barkley - making his first Chelsea appearance since 31 January - had an effort kept out by the Slovak goalkeeper.\nAsking about Conte's future on BBC Match of the Day, pundit Ian Wright said: \"It's got to be precarious with how they played today. They were Champions last year but it's been poor.\n\"The signings haven't worked and to clock off like they did, playing really poorly, is worrying.\"\nLate England call-up?\nBenitez is another whose job is in question, not because of the team's performances but because of his relationship with the hierarchy.\nHe said earlier this week\n, external\nthe club need to break their transfer record to sign a goalscorer in the summer as the \u00a316m they paid Real Madrid for striker Michael Owen 13 years ago remains the club's record acquisition.\nThe Newcastle supporters sang the Spaniard's name and chanted \"we want you to stay\" for much of the game, ironically in front of the fans who did not warm to him during his season as Chelsea boss in 2012-13 because of his past at Liverpool.\nBenitez, 58, has worked wonders with a squad largely made up of players who came up from the Championship last season.\n\"When you have the fans behind the team all season, this is the best way to finish,\" Benitez said.\n\"The final day here is always special because of the atmosphere the fans produce. From day one they were pleased with our work.\n\"We can enjoy today but there is still room for improvement. There is another year on my contract and I will try to do my best to move forward.\"\nPerez, who ended the season as the club's top scorer with eight goals in the league and 10 in all competitions, flicked in his first goal from Shelvey's low drive into the area. He then converted Florian Lejeune's cutback into an open net for his second.\nShelvey bossed the middle of the park with 73 passes, more than any of his team-mates, and his imposing showing could earn him a late call-up to the England World Cup squad, which will be named by Gareth Southgate on Wednesday.\n\"I would love to be called up and it would be a dream to be named in the 23-man squad to go to Russia,\" Shelvey told BBC Sport\n\"I have been asked in the street, 'have you heard anything?' I haven't, but I can only play as I have been doing.\n\"I have ended the season very well and from Christmas onwards my performances have been very good.\"\nShelvey's midfield partner Mohamed Diame was excellent too, making six tackles, four interceptions and winning the ball back 11 times in the contest.\n'I hope Rafa stays'\nOwner Ashley said in a statement:\n, external\n\"I would like to thank Rafa Benitez for his magnificent achievement this season.\n\"I would also like to applaud the players, led fantastically by the captain Jamaal Lascelles.\n\"On many occasions throughout the season they have been described as a Championship side, which I personally consider to be derogatory.\n\"Rafa, as always, has my full support, and contrary to some media reports that portray me as a pantomime villain, I will continue to ensure that every penny generated by the club is available to him.\n\"I hope very much that Rafa will remain at Newcastle United.\n\"Finally, I would like to thank the fans for their unrivalled support of Rafa and the team throughout the season.\"\n'Shelvey not a gamble for England'\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer\nJonjo Shelvey controlled the midfield. What we've made in the past with England is errors with gambling on players you can't rely on because of injury.\nJack Wilshere has had 12 starts this season because of injury and I don't think you can take too many gambles.\nShelvey isn't a gamble.\nMan of the match - Jonjo Shelvey (Newcastle)\nPerez on hot form - the stats\nNewcastle are only the third team to score two or more goals in five successive Premier League home games against Chelsea after Liverpool (six between 1992 and 1997) and Leicester (five between 1998 and 2002).\nChelsea failed to find the back of the net for the first time in their last nine top-flight games, since losing 1-0 to Manchester City on 4 March.\nBenitez registered his first win in the Premier League against a club he used to manage.\nGayle has scored 29 league goals for Newcastle since the start of last season, 12 more than any other player.\nGayle is the third player to score both home and away against Chelsea in the Premier League this season after Huddersfield's Laurent Depoitre and Roberto Pereyra of Watford.\nPerez has scored six goals in his past eight Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 55 in the competition.\nPerez also netted his first Premier League double in his 106th appearance in the competition.\nChelsea did not muster a single shot until the 52nd minute of the game, courtesy of a shot on target from Giroud."

        "article_text": "Huddersfield Town 0-1 Arsenal\nArsene Wenger said he was \"sad\" and would find it difficult to adjust to life without Arsenal as his 1,235-game reign as manager came to an end with a victory over Huddersfield on the final day of the Premier League season.\nThe game had little riding on it, with Huddersfield having already avoided relegation and Arsenal finishing sixth no matter what, and was played in a carnival atmosphere at John Smith's Stadium.\nWenger emerged for kick-off to a rapturous reception and went over to applaud the Arsenal fans, taking a bow.\nBoth sets of fans gave him a standing ovation after 22 minutes - to celebrate his 22 years in English football - and two planes flew over the ground in the early stages with banners celebrating the Frenchman.\nWenger brought three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups, including two Doubles, to Arsenal - but leaves them in the lowest position since he arrived, sixth.\n\"Of course it is very emotional after 1,235 games for the same club,\" said the 68-year-old. \"To enjoy it we had to win it. Winning football games is what makes me happy and the boys did it.\n\"Do I feel relief? Not really, I'm sad. At some stage it has to end. I wish everyone well, the fans have been great until the end and I wish the club well for the future.\n\"It will be hard to adjust but I will have to deal with that. I will remain an Arsenal fan above everything else.\n\"I will stay in football for sure. Whether that is managing or not... I am addicted and I don't think that can be cured.\"\nThis win over Huddersfield was the first time in eight attempts Arsenal have picked up any points away from home in the Premier League in 2018 - making them the last professional team in England to do so.\nTheir goal was scored by Wenger's final signing - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - as he slid home a low cross from their longest-serving player, Aaron Ramsey.\nTerriers midfielder Aaron Mooy almost denied Wenger his farewell win late on as his shot crashed off the crossbar.\n\"Twenty two years as a manager at one football club is incredible,\" said Town boss David Wagner. \"Even if you speak about it you can't believe it.\n\"I've been here for two and a half years and already it feels like 22 years. It was an honour for us to host his last game as Arsenal manager because he is a legend - a living legend.\"\nMan City were behind in games for just 153 minutes this season - final-day stats round-up\nSir Patrick Stewart on Huddersfield's 'wonderful' season\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nArsenal grind out final-day win\nWenger had hoped Wednesday's Europa League final would be his farewell game but Atletico Madrid scuppered those hopes in the semi-final, ensuring the Frenchman will not leave the club with Champions League football next season.\nIn truth, they have been poor for much of this campaign, with fans turning on Wenger before his departure was announced in April - enabling him to say goodbye in more pleasant circumstances.\nThe Gunners' sixth-placed finish is their worst under Wenger, and seven consecutive away Premier League defeats before this game tell their own story.\nThey were slightly fortunate to send Wenger off with a victory, with the only goal coming when Alexandre Lacazette passed the ball wide to Ramsey, who delivered an excellent low cross which Aubameyang turned home.\nThe Gunners only had four shots on target, with Lacazette chipping into Jonas Lossl's hands and Danny Welbeck firing straight at the goalkeeper in the second half.\nNow Arsenal have to find a replacement for Wenger and when the 2018-19 season starts, there will be a manager other than the Frenchman in the dugout for the first time since 1996.\n\"It will be strange not seeing him around in pre-season but change happens,\" said Ramsey. \"I am sure whoever comes in, this club is in a fantastic place for them to put their stamp on it. Arsene has created a fantastic team here that is capable of going on with a few tweaks.\"\nWenger said: \"I see a bright future for my successor because the team has a good attitude and quality. The team needs some additions and if they get them I think they will compete for the Premier League title.\"\nHuddersfield unlucky to lose - but they don't really care\nTerriers fans invaded the pitch at the final whistle, keen not to allow this defeat to overshadow a fantastic season in which their side have defied expectations to survive in the top flight.\nThey had ensured their safety with surprise draws at Manchester City and Chelsea in their previous two games - meaning their return to the top flight for the first time since 1972 would not be a one-year stay.\nWagner's side had chances throughout the game - although their two huge opportunities to spoil Wenger's farewell came late on.\nFirst Mooy smacked a shot off the crossbar, then Laurent Depoitre's header was saved by David Ospina on the line with seconds left after keeper Lossl had ventured forward for a corner.\nOn a day to celebrate, and with the clock winding down, the Terriers brought on retiring midfielder Dean Whitehead with three minutes left. He now joins the club's coaching staff.\n'The best lap of honour I've ever had'\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner: \"I think these players, the backroom staff and all the families deserve it for what they have done this season. They have worked very hard from day one.\n\"We're happy our supporters have something to celebrate. It is the best lap of honour I've ever had.\n\"I think staying up is a huge step for the football club. It was a massive step to get promoted last season and to keep our status is even bigger. To finish 16th is huge, an incredible achievement for this football club.\"\n'Arteta the right man to replace Wenger'\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright\nRight from the start when he came in Arsene was all about efficiency. It was about what you ate, how you prepared. He wanted me to be more efficient. He really was a breath of fresh air.\nI like the feel of Mikel Arteta to replace him. He knows the club and you've got to take a chance on someone. They took a chance on Wenger.\nSome of those players need a kick up the backsides and maybe Arteta is the man to do it.\nMan of the match - Arsene Wenger\nMatch stats - Gunners' unusual Sanchez stat comes to an end\nThe John Smith's Stadium was the 48th different ground Wenger has won at in the Premier League - more than any other manager in the competition (Sir Alex Ferguson 47).\nHuddersfield have failed to score in 21 different Premier League games this season - only Derby (22 in 2007-08) have ever failed in more in a single campaign.\nThis was the first away game Arsenal won in the Premier League in which Alexis Sanchez did not score since October 2016.\nIt was also the first time Arsenal kept a Premier League clean sheet on the road since December, having conceded in each of their last nine.\n1-0 was Wenger's third most common scoreline in Arsenal games in all competitions (124), after 1-1 and 2-1 (127 each).\nAubameyang has been directly involved in 14 goals in just 13 Premier League games (10 goals, 4 assists). Only Alan Shearer (16), Mick Quinn (16) and Kevin Phillips were involved in more in their first 13 in the competition."

This group of players really deserve it. They keep moving to the next level.\"\nSalah was the centre of attention as he was feted on his side's home pitch after the match. There was the Golden Boot for Premier League's top scorer to be presented, the club's player of the year trophy too. The forward was clearly moved, and he shared the moment with his wife and young daughter.\nIt was his record goal that set the Reds on course to blowing Brighton away. The opener, a low finish from Dominic Solanke's pass, was his 32nd goal of the campaign - the most by a player in a 38-game Premier League season.\nDejan Lovren doubled the lead by powerfully heading in Andrew Robertson's cross and after the break it was more of the same - Liverpool continued to dominate.\nSolanke smashed in his first goal for the club off the underside of the bar, having met Salah's lay-off at the end of a strong run, while full-back Andrew Robertson also got his first Liverpool goal, sweeping in from close range with five minutes to play.\nLiverpool would have slipped out of the top four had they lost and Chelsea beaten Newcastle, but they made sure the Blues' result - a 3-0 defeat at St James' Park - was irrelevant.\nVictory meant the Reds matched their fourth-place finish of last season - they would have moved up to third had Tottenham not edged a thrilling 5-4 win at home to Leicester - while Brighton ended their first top-flight campaign since 1983 in the safety of 15th.\nFootball Daily: 'Liverpool head to Kiev full of confidence'\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nSalah the record breaker\nWhat a remarkable season it has been for Egypt forward Salah, who signed from Roma for \u00a334m last summer.\nSome doubted his ability to perform in England following his disappointing spell at Chelsea, but the goal that broke the Premier League record was his 44th in 51 games for Liverpool in all competitions this season.\nAlan Shearer scored 31 Premier League goals for Blackburn in 1995-96, Cristiano Ronaldo did the same for Manchester United in 2007-08, and Luis Suarez netted 31 for Liverpool in 2013-14.\nShearer, for Blackburn in 1994-95, and Andy Cole, for Newcastle United in 1993-94, jointly hold the Premier League scoring record for a 42-match season - with 34 goals.\nPerhaps that total is what Salah was thinking of when he was taken off just before Liverpool's fourth, visibly disappointed. He left with Brighton at their most vulnerable, weary and exhausted from an afternoon living on their nerves against Liverpool's attack.\nEarlier on Sunday, Salah added the Premier League's Player of the Season award to the two other major individual prizes he was won this year - the PFA Player of the Year and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year awards.\nBut with the Champions League final against Real - winners of the past two tournaments - to come, the biggest piece of silverware is still to be settled.\nBrighton beaten - but they will be back\nChris Hughton's Brighton team can feel proud of what they have achieved this season. Many will have tipped them for relegation, but they have proved themselves more than capable of competing at English football's elite level.\nThere was the impressive 3-0 victory at West Ham in October, March's 2-1 home win over Arsenal at the end of a five-match unbeaten run, and a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals, where they lost to Manchester United.\nRevenge over United came in the shape of a 1-0 win that confirmed their Premier League status on 4 May, and survival was always the only aim for Brighton this season - Hughton said it \"meant everything\".\nBut perhaps there will be a slight regret over their end-of-season form. The 4 March victory over Arsenal put the Seagulls 10th in the table, after which they fell sharply over a run of seven matches without a win.\nA 10th-place finish would have earned them \u00a321.4m in prize money - the take for finishing 15th will instead be \u00a311.6m. Regardless, the most important thing has been achieved - they will be back next season.\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah\n'I had no clue about the record!'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \"The boys had pressure on them - massive pressure for the last few weeks. It is fantastic to qualify for the Champions League. It's a massive achievement.\n\"We did it in an impressive manner. We tried to win the game from the first second. A point was enough but I have no real idea how to go for a point.\n\"We could have scored many more but I'm glad we didn't. Brighton did not deserve that after a really good season.\n\"James Milner (who was left out of the squad) will be fine, just today was a bit early for him.\n\"I had no clue about (Salah's) record. I took him off and then I heard that Tottenham had scored five - Harry Kane could have got them all! He has been brilliant and he can improve so much. He will score in the future, 100%.\"\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton told BBC Sport: \"It was a very hard afternoon for us. We knew when we came here we would have to play at a very high level and stay in the game but they caused us so many problems.\n\"The only disappointment was that we didn't keep possession well enough today. The season as a whole, we have been in nearly every game and we have had good performances against the big clubs.\n\"We find it hard playing the top six away from home but our season shows more good than bad.\"\n'Unmarkable, unplayable Salah'\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright\nSalah was back to his best against Brighton. I've only seen him have two poor games all season: against Chelsea and Roma.\nBut he got his record-breaking goal and I think he should have had a penalty too.\nHe was unmarkable, unplayable. I was very surprised to see him play in some games recently because I would have been saving him.\nBut he's scored against 17 teams and now he's got the Golden Boot.\nAnother unbeaten season at home - the stats\nLiverpool have gone unbeaten at home in a top-flight season for the seventh time, more than any other side\nThey have finished in the top four in consecutive Premier League seasons for the first time since a run of four campaigns between 2005-06 and 2008-09\nSalah has scored against 17 different opponents in the league this season; a Premier League record\nHe has scored in 34 different club games in all competitions this season, at least four more than any other player in Europe's big five leagues (Paris St-Germain's Edinson Cavani, 30)"

We won 50 points at home and 50 away. It's massive. One hundred points is magnificent.\"\nAs well as winning the most points by an English top-flight side in a single campaign, City's 32nd win broke Tottenham's 57-year-old record for victories in a single top-flight season.\n\"It was such a complicated game. It was so hard. The players suffered. Southampton are a physical team, so many people defending deep,\" added Guardiola.\nSouthampton needed a point to be sure of safety, but Swansea's 2-1 home defeat by Stoke meant Saints will play in the top flight for a seventh successive season despite this defeat.\nWhat happened on the final day of the Premier League?\nMan City were behind in games for just 153 minutes this season - final-day stats round-up\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nRecord-breaking City end season on a high\nRarely has Guardiola celebrated a goal like he did when substitute Jesus' exquisite 93rd-minute chip crossed the line.\nWith just seconds remaining of the three minutes of additional time, the Brazil forward latched on to Kevin de Bruyne's excellent floated cross over the top - delivered from deep in his own half - before beating Alex McCarthy after the keeper had rushed off his line.\nIt was virtually the final touch of a magnificent campaign which saw City end the season with a record 16 away wins and 106 Premier League goals.\nGuardiola leapt out of his seat to punch the air while Jesus whipped off his shirt in celebration in front of City's delirious fans.\nThis was far from vintage City, though. They were frustrated for long spells but, nevertheless, their players were still on the pitch celebrating in front of their travelling fans 20 minutes after the final whistle.\nTeenagers Phil Foden and Brahim Diaz were sent on in the closing stages for their fifth league appearances of the season, ensuring they will both receive a title winners' medal.\n\"They deserve to be champions,\" said Guardiola.\nEderson extends Man City deal by two years - to 2025\nWhat now for Hughes?\nSouthampton were five points from safety with five games to play after a 3-2 home defeat by Chelsea on 14 April.\nHowever, an upturn in results means they end a troubled season three points above the relegation zone despite winning only seven top-flight matches.\nSaints fans stayed after the final whistle as home players, along with manager Mark Hughes, walked round the pitch with their families to applaud supporters.\nIt was more a lap of relief than one of celebration.\nHughes, who joined the Saints on a short-term contract in March, has made it clear he would like to remain in the position on a permanent basis and has urged the Saints board to make a quick decision.\n\"I'm sure the club will have conversations with me this week one way or another,\" he said. \"Clearly they need to get on with planning for next year. We'll wait and see. It's a good club.\"\nWhat will undoubtedly go in his favour is the way his players have performed in the past few games, suggesting he has the support of the dressing room.\nIn fact, Southampton can count themselves unfortunate not to have come away with a point from this game.\nAlthough City dominated possession, the hosts produced a gritty and determined performance. It must, however, be a summer of change at St Mary's if Southampton are to avoid another relegation fight next season.\n\"The players are probably embarrassed by the season they've had because it's a quality squad,\" said Hughes.\n\"They are desperately disappointed at being beaten today and that's a good sign. It has been a huge effort by everybody to stay up. It wasn't an easy situation.\"\n'It must be a joy to watch them as a fan'\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer\nYou can't compare them to the great Manchester United teams of Alex Ferguson just yet but they're definitely here to stay and it's just been a magnificent season.\nIt must be an absolute joy to be a Manchester City fan and watch that football.\nLiverpool are the only team who went head to head with them this season.

That would be nice,\" he said.\nBournemouth's powers of recovery\nBournemouth's campaign has been characterised by their ability to recover from a losing position.\nThey ended their season with the same scoreline as when their string of comebacks began against Brighton at the Vitality Stadium in September.\nAt Burnley, the turnaround was largely due to the contribution of substitutes Dan Gosling, Wilson and Defoe.\nThe presence of Wilson and Defoe in particular unnerved a Burnley defence that had, until their introduction, been unperturbed apart from when Aaron Lennon appeared to trip King in the penalty area.\n\"They are three quality players, the substitutes. I couldn't have picked a better three to come on,\" Howe said.\n\"They came on and helped the momentum to shift back our way like we've done with our substitutes at other times this season.\"\nWith Wilson and Defoe on, the game opened up, allowing the space for King to restore parity.\nWilson's winner - his first goal in 12 matches, created by Defoe's persistence and unselfishness - was ample reward for Howe's boldness and the spirit in the camp.\nMan of the match - Joshua King (Bournemouth)\nFirst victory at Burnley - the stats\nBurnley have won the lowest percentage of their Premier League points in home games this season (48% - 26 out of 54). Last season, they won a league-high 82.5% of their Premier League points at home (33/40).\nThe Cherries enjoyed their first victory in 15 visits to Burnley in all competitions (D6 L8).\nWood has netted six goals in his past nine Premier League games, after scoring only four in his first 15.\nWood is only the third Burnley player to score 10 or more goals in a Premier League campaign, after Danny Ings (11 in 2014-15) and Sam Vokes (10 in 2016).\nKing netted his 30th Premier League goal for Bournemouth, 11 more than any other player for the Cherries.\nKing has scored in three successive Premier League games against Burnley; against no other side has he scored in more consecutive games (also three against Swansea)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 5-4 Leicester City\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said it is a \"very exciting moment\" for the club after they ended the season by winning a sensational nine-goal thriller against Leicester to clinch third place in the Premier League.\nThe hosts trailed 3-1 after 47 minutes, scored three goals in 11 minutes to lead 4-3, only to be pegged back to 4-4 before Harry Kane curled in a 76th-minute winner.\nThe game was Spurs' last at Wembley before they return to the redeveloped White Hart Lane next season.\n\"It was a fantastic season to finish third and guarantee the Champions League next season,\" Pochettino told Match of the Day.\n\"With the move to the new stadium it is a very exciting moment for this football club.\n\"It means a lot for the club, the players and the fans.\"\nKane's winner was his second goal of the game, after he levelled following Jamie Vardy's opener, and takes him to 30 Premier League goals in a season for the first time.\nSpurs were 2-1 behind at half-time after Riyad Mahrez had added to Vardy's early header and three minutes after the break Kelechi Iheanacho smashed into the top corner from distance to give Leicester a two-goal cushion.\nBut Spurs responded with three quick-fire goals, two for Erik Lamela and an own goal from Christian Fuchs.\nIn a remarkable second half, Vardy then drew Leicester level with his side's fourth of the afternoon, smashing into the roof of the net after a trademark run in behind the defence.\nHowever it was Vardy's international team-mate Kane who had the final say with his effort from the edge of the penalty area, meaning Leicester finished the season ninth.\nRelive the action from Wembley\nReaction from Wembley and the rest of Sunday's Premier League games\nMan City were behind in games for just 153 minutes this season - final-day stats round-up\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nRemarkable end to Spurs' temporary move\nSpurs have not always looked comfortable this season playing their home games at Wembley while White Hart Lane is being rebuilt.\nThey have had notable highs including a Champions League win over Real Madrid, a 4-1 thrashing of Liverpool and fine victories over north London rivals Arsenal and top-four challengers Manchester United, but this game was surely the most entertaining of the lot.\nWith Spurs only able to finish third or fourth and Leicester eighth or ninth, both sides attacked with numbers throughout.\nIt came in a losing cause, but Iheanacho's strike was the pick of the nine goals as he drove forward from midfield, held off a challenge and drove a powerful shot into the top-right corner.\nWith Spurs looking unsure defensively - Jan Vertonghen was injured in the warm-up - Leicester were worthy of their 3-1 lead with Vardy and Mahrez impressing.\nBut the game swung with Tottenham's three-goal burst, which began just two minutes after Iheanacho's strike.\nAfter a quiet first half, Lamela twice tapped in from close range after crosses from Kyle Walker-Peters, while he also had the shot which was deflected in off Fuchs for the own goal.\nThe win seals a third successive top-three finish for Spurs and there was a celebratory mood at full-time as the players said goodbye to Wembley with a lap of appreciation in front of a near-capacity crowd.\n\"From the beginning it was tough,\" Pochettino said.\n\"For our fans it was tough to settle here and for the players and the staff. In the end we created that feeling that Wembley was our home and we feel fantastic emotions here.\n\"It is a fantastic achievement for us after 38 games away from home.\"\nPuel removes the shackles\nLeicester manager Claude Puel has reportedly\n, external\nbeen under pressure in recent weeks, despite guiding the club to just a second top-10 Premier League finish since 2000.\nThat comes after accusations of negative football since he took over in October with the team 14th in the table.\nAt Wembley, like in midweek during the Foxes' 3-1 win over Arsenal, Leicester were entertaining going forward. There could be no complaints that the team were not good to watch.\nPuel started with Vardy and Iheanacho up front and both caused problems throughout while Mahrez was his typically threatening self and claimed the assists for both of Vardy's goals.\nPuel described the game as \"crazy\" and said his side should have taken all three points.\n\"It is crazy to lose this game when we scored four goals away,\" the Frenchman said.\n\"We had to do much better after our third goal. It is a shame we saw a good game, a crazy game.\n\"We played a good game with good intensity. We should have won this game.\"\nIt remains to be seen if Puel and Mahrez, who has been consistently linked with a transfer, will be at the King Power Stadium next season.\nSeason of success or failure for Spurs?\nSpurs guaranteed Champions League football at their new stadium next season with a victory over Newcastle on Wednesday and despite the thrilling nature of their final-day win it is still difficult to judge their season.\nIt is the first time since 1995 Spurs have finished as the top club in London but again they finish without silverware - although captain Hugo Lloris said a top-four finish \"means more than a trophy\".\nThey finish the campaign 23 points behind champions Manchester City after being 11 and seven points behind the title winners in the previous two campaigns.\nPochettino's side took 43 points from their 18 home games this season compared to 53 at White Hart Lane last season.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nRecord equalled at Wembley - the best stats\nTottenham's 5-4 victory equals the most goals scored in a competitive club match at Wembley Stadium (Chelsea 5-4 Man City in the 1986 Full Members Cup final).\nLeicester lost after leading by two goals in the top flight for the first time since October 2003 (3-4 v Wolves).\nKane has scored more goals in all competitions versus Leicester than against any other side in his career (13).\nKane is the first Spurs player to score 40+ goals in a season in all competitions since Clive Allen in 1986-87 (49).\nKane has reached 30 Premier League goals for the first time in his career - the first Englishman to do so since Kevin Phillips in 1999-2000 (also 30).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2014, Vardy has scored 26 goals against the 'big-six' sides - six more than any other player during this period (Sergio Aguero, 20)."

I would say more often than not I bet you it's proved wrong.\n\"We've shown we're trying to improve. I don't know if anybody can come and make that big a difference in six months. Even Pep Guardiola took a bit of time to get his team right.\n\"I'd think you'd need to give a bit longer. But every manager now is in transit. I don't think there is a long period.\"\nEchoing that air of uncertainty - Allardyce gave a curt response to questions on his future. He said: \"I can't quite say confident after all the rumours I'm reading in the paper. Generally there's no smoke without fire. We'll wait and see when we meet up.\"\nWest Ham defender James Collins, who is yet to sign a new deal and is out of contract in the summer, received a standing ovation when he replaced Aaron Cresswell near the end and wept at the final whistle, suggesting his 10 years of service over two spells may be coming to an end.\nAnd the Hammers' supporters cheered the players as they made their lap of appreciation around the London Stadium pitch in the sunshine, a markedly more upbeat atmosphere than at times this season.\nMan City were behind in games for just 153 minutes this season - final-day stats round-up\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nStar man Arnie shines\nSeven points from the last three games and another impressive showing from Arnautovic ensured the Hammers signed off the campaign with a smile.\nThe Austrian forward was referred to as the \"star man\" by team-mate Cresswell afterwards and Moyes believes changing his role from the wing to up front was a turning point in their season.\n\"Maybe he wasn't doing as much and tracking back on the wing,\" said the Scot before Sunday's win. \"He's been a sensation up front, he's been playing as well as most strikers.\"\nThe man they call 'Arnie' brushed past the visiting defence with ease to smash the second goal of the game past Pickford and led the line strongly throughout while also making five key passes.\nMoyes' ability to get the best out of a player who underwhelmed initially after joining from Stoke last summer certainly helped West Ham remain in the top flight.\nArnautovic scored 11 goals and applied himself consistently as the club pulled away from danger to secure survival last weekend.\nMoyes could not add further clarity on his future after the final whistle but even if he departs, he can reflect on a job well done in his brief reign since taking over from Slaven Bilic in November.\nUncertainty lingers for Allardyce\nA change in manager ultimately ensured Premier League survival for both of these clubs, but fan unrest continues.\nSome Evertonians have been unhappy with Allardyce's reign in recent weeks, and those dissenters will not have been appeased with this result.\nThe former England boss started with a back three, bringing Argentina international Ramiro Funes Mori into his line-up next to Phil Jagielka and Michael Keane.\nIt didn't work, however, as Lanzini scored an impressive opener and Arnautovic was allowed to turn and run at goal too easily in the build-up to his strike.\nDespite changing to a back four in the second half, which brought Everton back into the contest for a while, they still conceded to Lanzini again when he got ahead of Seamus Coleman and curled a shot into the top corner.\nAllardyce will point to key saves by Adrian which denied his men but supporters in the away end booed his decision to take off striker Cenk Tosun in the second half, with the Turk also visibly unhappy after receiving precious little service throughout.\nDespite having more shots on target than the hosts, Everton came away with nothing.\n\"Overall we managed to seal eighth spot and a few more coffers in the pot for the club,\" said Allardyce, who will meet the club's owner Farhad Moshiri in the next few days.\nMan of the match - Manuel Lanzini (West Ham)\n'There is something to build on here' - what they said\nWest Ham manager David Moyes said: \"I can't say (about the future) because I am no further forward. We will meet and talk next week, we haven't arranged a date or a time.\n\"What will influence me? When you get good performances. It makes you feel 'hey, there's something to build on here'.\"\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is disappointing to lose the game when the chances we missed were better than the chances they scored with.\n\"But then you have to credit Adrian for being absolutely outstanding with three top-class saves.\n\"All three should have gone in - that's where the difference was. I am pleased with the second half, not so pleased with the first half.\"\nMoyes retains upper hand over Allardyce - the stats\nDavid Moyes has won eight of his last nine meetings with Sam Allardyce in the competition (L1), including each of his last six in a row.\nAllardyce has lost four of his last five final-day games (D1), with his last win coming with the Hammers against Reading in May 2013.\nAllardyce lost his 200th Premier League game, becoming only the second manager to do so (after Harry Redknapp, 238 defeats).\nWest Ham's 13th-place finish is their lowest since 2013-14 when they also finished 13th.\nEverton have won just one of their last 15 away Premier League games in London (D6 L8), winning 1-0 at Crystal Palace in January 2017.\nManuel Lanzini has been directly involved in 11 Premier League goals this season (five goals, six assists), his best figures in an English top-flight campaign.\nAfter failing to register a goal involvement in his first 11 Premier League games for West Ham, Marko Arnautovic scored 11 and assisted six in his following 20 appearances.\nArnautovic has scored 11 Premier League goals this season, the most by a West Ham player in a single top-flight campaign since Bobby Zamora in 2006-07 (also 11).\nOumar Niasse netted eight goals in the Premier League for Everton in 2017-18 - double his tally from his previous two top-flight campaigns (4)."

I spare a thought for them and their players, especially the ones I worked with.\"\nWest Brom were relegated on Tuesday after Southampton beat Swansea but have been resurgent under caretaker boss Darren Moore, with this their only defeat in his six matches in charge.\n\"It's been an end of the season where pride has been restored when it could've been terrible,\" said Moore, who replaced the sacked Alan Pardew last month.\n\"We achieved some great results and pulled back a points deficit to give us a glimmer of hope, but when it was confirmed, all that was hard to take - there was definitely a hangover from that. We just ran out of steam.\"\nWhat happened on the final day of the Premier League?\nFinal-day stats round-up\nRetiring Motson set for Bafta honour after Selhurst Park farewell\nThe Premier League table - from August to May\n, external\nPalace cap stunning turnaround\nAfter seven games of the season, Palace were not just bottom of the table but pointless, goalless and had already sacked Frank de Boer.\nHodgson has overseen a stirring turnaround, with the ex-England manager the subject of warm applause and chants from both the home crowd and supporters of former side West Brom.\nThis victory underlined the nature of that reversal - Palace were organised in defence, comfortable keeping hold of the ball and moving it quickly, all while exploiting the pace and skill of Zaha in attack.\nThe Ivory Coast forward formed a dangerous combination with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Van Aanholt down the left to finally break down the Baggies, the former sliding in the left-back to cut the ball back across for Zaha to guide home.\nYohan Cabaye then sparked a sequence of first-time passes on the edge of the area to play in Van Aanholt, whose strike was confirmed by goalline technology when it was cleared after crossing the line. Two excellent goals and the end-of-season celebrations could start at Selhurst Park.\nThose celebrations extended to Palace defender Pape Souare, who came on as a substitute to make his first appearance since a horrific car crash in September 2016 that threatened to end his career.\nInstead of relegation, Palace are now disappointed to miss out on a top-10 finish after Newcastle's 3-0 victory over Chelsea, a mark of how far they have come under Hodgson, who has enjoyed redemption after England's chastening Euro 2016 exit.\nThe challenge will be how Hodgson takes this club forward, and whether they can hang on to Zaha.\nDo West Brom want Moore?\nThe Baggies were 10th after seven games but end their eight-year stay in the top flight by finishing bottom following this result and Stoke's victory over fellow relegated side Swansea.\nUnlike Palace, their managerial changes did not work out. Tony Pulis was sacked in November, followed by Pardew's ill-fated spell that ended last month and may be most memorable for the taxi incident during a training camp in Barcelona in February.\nBut then Moore took over and raised hope of an escape that would have been as dramatic as the Baggies' brilliant achievement in 2004-05, only for relegation to be confirmed on Tuesday.\nOnce again, West Brom were stubborn and well organised but struggled to create, with Grzegorz Krychowiak going closest when he dragged a volley just wide.\nBut will the Baggies make Moore's role permanent or opt for a more experienced manager in the Championship?\nMoore himself would not be drawn, telling BBC Sport: \"It would be unfair to speak about my future now but I will be part of any process going forward.\"\nMotty's farewell\nThis game was the final Match of the Day commentary by the legendary John Motson, who is retiring after 50 years with the BBC.\n'Motty' was invited onto the pitch after full-time and applauded by the fans before Hodgson presented him with a framed copy of the programme from his first and last matches at Selhurst Park and a crystal microphone.\n\"It's been a fantastic day - I've always had a nice reception at Selhurst Park but this has been terrific,\" said Motson.\n\"I've had people running up to me for autographs, I really didn't expect it. I've had a great reception everywhere this season but I've not been received with quite the enthusiasm I've had here at Selhurst Park.\"\nBBC Two will dedicate an evening of shows to the 72-year-old next Saturday - FA Cup final day.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\n'A hurdle too far' - match reaction\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson: \"We've really been safe for a couple of weeks now and were playing an already relegated side so this could've degenerated to a keep-ball session but you couldn't accuse us of that.\n\"We've worked hard to get this team playing this way so it would be a shame to see that go out of the window. I'm hoping we get reinforcements as it will be exciting to keep the bulk of this team together and add to it.\n\"I understand people coveting our players like Wilfried Zaha but he loves playing for the club, he's a Croydon boy and I don't think he's going to jump at the first opportunity.\"\nWest Brom caretaker boss Darren Moore: \"It was disappointing.

In 18 games, we got 20 points. The beginning of the season was not good. We tried to recover. Me and my players were on the limits, we did the maximum that we could.\n\"Getting 20 points was very good, not fantastic. Over the whole season it would have been enough to finish around 13th.\n\"I'm only here for four months, so I can't talk about the structure of the club. I'm not the best person to talk about that.\n\"I talked with the owners yesterday. We will talk again on Monday. I will think about Swansea and myself.\"\nStoke City manager Paul Lambert to BBC Sport: \"You look at the fanbase that we have behind us, it was good for them. There were a lot of good things. The effort and I've seen everything I've asked for, the lads have given me it.\n\"Fifteen games is never long enough. There were things wrong, without a doubt. I did what I think is right. We drew games that we should have won. A little bit more quality across the top and we wouldn't be in this position. Effort, I can't ask for any more.\n\"I'm sure the club will know what's wrong and what is right. With that fanbase behind you, you have a chance.\n\"There's a core of players, but there's a turnaround that needs to happen. It's a really good core, if they have the right players that want to be at the club. I'm sure the club will learn from what has happened this year.\"\n'The board deserve some blame'\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer\nYou've got to blame the board at Swansea too. Years ago they used to have a plan when it was Roberto Martinez or Brendan Rodgers and they knew how they wanted to play but they've panicked recently and lost that.\nCrouch notches the 1,000th - the stats\nSwansea collected 17 points in their first nine matches under Carvalhal (W5 D2 L2) - in their subsequent nine, they have collected just three (W0 D3 L6).\nStoke secured their first league double over the Swans since 1992-93, when they were in the third tier.\nAfter saving just one of his first 15 penalties in the Premier League, Lukasz Fabianski has saved three of his past six in the competition.\nCrouch's header was the 1,000th goal in the Premier League this season.\nCrouch extended his Premier League record for most headed goals in the competition (53).\nKing has scored two goals from four shots on target for Swansea in 11 Premier League appearances, this after scoring once for Leicester in 11 games this term.\nLasse Sorensen, who assisted Crouch's goal, became the youngest player to start for Stoke in the Premier League (18 years, 204 days).\nThis is the second time in Premier League history that two teams beginning with the letter 'S' have been relegated in the same season - also 1993-94 (Swindon and Sheffield United).\nShaqiri has had a hand in more Premier League goals this term than any other Stoke player (15 - 8 goals, 7 assists)."

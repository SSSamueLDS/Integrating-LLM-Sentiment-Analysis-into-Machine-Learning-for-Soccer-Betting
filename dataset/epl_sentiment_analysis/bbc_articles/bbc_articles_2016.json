        "article_text": "Southampton 1-1 Watford\nNathan Redmond scored on his first Premier League appearance for Southampton to rescue a point against Watford at St Mary's Stadium.\nEtienne Capoue rifled the Hornets into the lead after a header by Troy Deeney created space for the midfielder.\nSouthampton's Shane Long headed Dusan Tadic's cross wide before Redmond, who joined from Norwich in the summer, volleyed Tadic's corner home.\nWatford substitute Ben Watson was sent off for a foul on Long on 76 minutes.\nRelive the action from St Mary's Stadium as 10-man Watford secure a point\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nWayward Saints leave Puel with much to consider\nSouthampton have a long season ahead under new manager Claude Puel as they look to juggle a busy Premier League campaign with the group stage of the Europa League. They ended the Ronald Koeman era with four-straight league wins.\nAnd although Redmond's goal was greeted with relief, there was frustration at the end. The Saints were laboured and lacked cutting edge after falling behind until Redmond's equaliser.\nWatson had only been on the pitch for 11 minutes and 23 seconds when he was shown a red card for hauling down Long as the striker looked to race through on goal.\nFormer Bayern Munich midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg provided promise for the Saints with his surging runs after coming on as a substitute.\nCan Watford surprise under Mazzarri?\nThere was surprise when Watford announced Quique Sanchez Flores was to leave after steering the club to the FA Cup semi-final and a 13th-placed finish last season.\nYet the Hornets delivered a dogged performance in Walter Mazzarri's first competitive game in charge to leave their travelling fans optimistic about the season ahead.\nThey were without club-record signing Isaac Success because of injury yet went ahead as Capoue fired his first league goal for the Hornets after a sweeping move involving the impressive Nordin Amrabat and Deeney.\nIt was Watford's only shot on target in the game.\nHornets goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes saved well from the busy Tadic while Craig Cathcart and Sebastian Prodl were both solid at the back, particularly after Watson's dismissal left them seriously under pressure.\nHow did the new signings do?\nSouthampton:\nNathan Redmond - A superbly-taken goal from a corner. Looked much livelier after the interval after a slow start.\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg - Injected pace and urgency into the team after coming on early in the second half. The Danish midfielder was not afraid to shoot and was hard-working.\nJeremy Pied - The French defender came on with 11 minutes of normal time remaining.\nWatford:\nJuan Camilo Zuniga - Watford have signed five players this summer but Colombia defender Zuniga is the only one who made it on to the pitch at St Mary's. The 30-year-old, on a season-long loan from Napoli, came on as a late substitute and still made some crucial challenges to help earn his side a point.\nMan of the Match - Dusan Tadic (Southampton)\nWhat they said:\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"At half-time I told the players 'just don't be afraid'. In the second half it was important to make good intentions and play good football.\n\"If you play good football, you don't have problems. This was true in the second half.\n\"In the second half you can see the future.\"\nSouthampton goalscorer Nathan Redmond: \"The manager told us at half-time to take pride in what we were doing. We showed great spirit to come back.\n\"To get my first goal is good but I'd have preferred the three points.\"\nWatford boss Walter Mazzarri: \"When we had 10 men we were not able to play our game but the team showed great character.\n\"I think in the first half we could have got a bit more. When our energy was good we played a great game but we couldn't quite finish the game off.\n\"The players have done well with the formation and I think we were unlucky with the red card because we were playing well at that moment.\"\nThe game in numbers...\n0: Watford have never won on the opening weekend of a Premier League season (D2 L2)\n13: Southampton have conceded in 13 consecutive Premier League games, their longest run without a clean sheet since November 2012.\n4: Ben Watson received his fourth red card in English league football, and his first since October 2009.\n6: Troy Deeney has been involved in six of Watford's past seven Premier League goals (four goals, two assists).\nWhat next?\nWhile Southampton's next game is against Manchester United at Old Trafford next Friday (20:00 BST), Watford have a bit more time to prepare for their next match. That is against Chelsea at home on 20 August (15:00)."

The margins are tight, the details are important and we gave away a soft goal.\n\"The second half was a good performance and we put a good side on the back foot. We have to learn quickly, it is an unforgiving league.\n\"We needed a big decision today, and the foul on Michael Keane when his shirt was pulled all over the place. The linesman can't see it, the ref can't see it, but we can see it. Frustrating but that's the way it goes.\"\nSwansea head coach Francesco Guidolin:\n\"It's a good start against a good team at a difficult ground but we are happy, because this was an important victory and we're more confident for the future.\n\"Llorente played well for 90 minutes, I didn't believe he could play for 90 because it's his first time but he's a professional and a good guy. He's important for us, he's strong, good in the air and a champion.\n\"I'm happy for Leroy, I feel he could get many goals because he is strong in the air and he often gets into the penalty area.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSince moving to Swansea City in the summer of 2014, \u0141ukasz Fabianski has kept 23 clean sheets in the Premier League; only Manchester City's Joe Hart (29), David de Gea of Manchester United (25) and Liverpool's Simon Mignolet (24) can better this haul.\nFabianski has also made 255 saves in the Premier League, more than any other goalkeeper.\nThis game was Burnley's first defeat in their past 24 league games.\nSwansea are unbeaten in their past eight Premier League games played in the month of August (W6 D2 L0).\nBurnley have failed to score in eight of their past 10 matches in the top flight.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley's next outing is away at Liverpool on 20 August at 15:00 BST while Swansea host Hull, who beat champions Leicester in the first game of the Premier League season, at the same time.\nMan of the match - Modou Barrow"

        "article_text": "Everton 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur\nErik Lamela's second-half header salvaged a point for Tottenham against an Everton side who impressed in their first league game under Ronald Koeman.\nThe Toffees' high pressing unsettled Spurs during the first half and they took the lead when Ross Barkley's free-kick sneaked past Hugo Lloris.\nThe Spurs keeper then came off in the 35th minute with a hamstring injury.\nThe visitors equalised when Argentina winger Lamela stooped to meet Kyle Walker's delivery from the right.\nRelive the action from Goodison Park\nReaction from Saturday's other Premier League matches\nHere, there and everywhere\nHad Everton's players been at 100% rather than \"70% physically\", as new manager Koeman suggested pre-match, then perhaps the outcome at Goodison Park would have been different.\nThe Toffees gave Tottenham barely any time on the ball in the opening period with their incessant pressing.\nThis style of football, seen under the Dutchman when he was at Southampton, has quickly been incorporated at his new club.\nYoung Spaniard Gerard Deulofeu, the lone man in attack with Romelu Lukaku injured, led by example as he badgered the Tottenham centre-backs Toby Aldeweireld and Jan Vertonghen when they had the ball.\nEverton's goal came from a set-piece and Lloris might be disappointed that neither he nor his defence dealt with it, as Barkley's teasing ball in from out wide missed the heads it was intended for and bounced in beyond the reach of the France international.\nThe Spurs keeper did not appear to be struggling up until that point but came off 10 minutes before half-time with a hamstring problem.\nThe right change at the right time\nTottenham's England striker Harry Kane was playing at Goodison Park - although you would be forgiven for not noticing.\nHe played a lone attacking role for 56 minutes and hardly had a sniff of the ball, which was partly due to poor service and partly due to brilliant closing down by Everton.\nIt was a similar story for attacking midfielders Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, who at least managed a shot on goal in the first half.\nManager Mauricio Pochettino finally decided to twist 11 minutes into the second half when he brought on new forward signing Vincent Janssen to support Kane. What that did was pull one of the Everton midfielders further forward and freed up more space in the middle third.\nKyle Walker exploited this new-found freedom in the 59th minute when he surged down the right and delivered a brilliant cross for Lamela who nodded in from close range.\nSpurs should have won the game but were denied by two outstanding saves by Everton's new goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.\nHow did the new signings do?\nEverton:\nIdrissa Gueye - An absolute terrier in defensive midfield for Everton. A brilliant lunging dive in front of Alli in the second half which caused the England midfielder to rush his strike was a great example of his tenacity.\nMaarten Stekelenburg - The Dutchman had a quiet game until the second half when he produced two tremendous saves. A one-handed stop denied Janssen at point-blank range and then he tipped over Lamela's deflected shot.\nTottenham:\nVictor Wanyama - Similar to Gueye, in the sense the former Southampton player made his presence on the field known early on with a couple of challenges.\nVincent Janssen - His arrival on the pitch sparked a change in fortunes for Spurs and he was unlucky not to score. All in all, a good start to his Premier League career.\nMan of the match - Idrissa Gueye (Everton)\nWhat the managers said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"The first half was difficult for us and we did not play well. Hugo Lloris got injured and that was a big impact on us. In the second half we played as we usually play.\n\"They scored early and they believed they could win the game. They were very motivated.\n\"Lloris has a hamstring injury and we need to assess tomorrow to see what happens.\n\"We tried to correct the problems we had in the first half. With another striker, the team felt comfortable. Vincent Janssen brought good energy on the team and he gives us a different option.\"\nOn transfers: \"We may get one or two. We are very open, it is not easy to bring in players who can help us but we are trying.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman:\n\"We had a big, big chance close to half-time with Gerard Deulofeu. They had two big chances too but I think it is a fair result.\n\"The reaction of the crowd and fans was fantastic. I am very pleased about our first performance against a very good team.\n\"Ross Barkley's first goal is one of his qualities. I want the players to work hard and the pressing starts from the strikers. The players need to improve in that.\n\"One save from Maarten Stekelenburg was incredible in a key moment of the game.\"\nOn transfers: \"I was focused on today's match but we are waiting for two or three new players and the board are working hard to bring them in. I don't talk about names. I hope we can sign two players next week.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBarkley has scored in each of his last three Premier League appearances on the opening matchday for Everton (2013-14, 2015-16 and 2016-17).\nGareth Barry has now appeared in his 20th Premier League season - only Ryan Giggs (22) has played in more, and only Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard (20) have played in as many.\nEverton have drawn their last four opening day matches, with Barkley scoring three of their seven goals in this run.\nLamela has had a hand in seven goals in his last seven Premier League appearances (three goals, four assists).\nEverton have not defeated Tottenham in any of their last eight Premier League meetings.\nKane had fewer touches than any other Tottenham outfield player to start versus Everton (35).\nWhat's next?\nEverton are away at West Brom at 15:00 BST next Saturday and Spurs host Crystal Palace at the same time in their first league game at White Hart Lane this season."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-1 West Bromwich Albion\nSalomon Rondon's header was enough to give West Brom a narrow win over Crystal Palace in a dreary Premier League opener at Selhurst Park.\nBoth of these sides struggled for wins at the back end of last season and it showed in a game low on chances.\nCrystal Palace debutant Andros Townsend failed to inspire the home side following his move from Newcastle.\nRondon flicked in James McClean's free-kick on 74 minutes for the only goal to hand Tony Pulis' side three points.\nRecap all the key moments from West Brom's win at Crystal Palace\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nBoth sides had just six Premier League wins between them in 2016 - two for Palace and four for West Brom. They also had the two lowest goal tallies in the league last season, aside from relegated Aston Villa.\nThe prospect of an opening-day thriller was always going to be optimistic.\nAnd so it proved. The only opportunities of note, apart from the goal, were a Rondon header saved by Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey and Albion's Ben Foster charging down Wilfried Zaha when the forward was clean through.\nTownsend toils, Bolasie's 'heart and soul elsewhere'\nBeaten FA Cup finalists Palace had finished 15th last term, one place below their opponents, but have been the more active in the transfer market, bringing in three players compared to Albion's one.\nOnly Townsend of those new arrivals featured, with defender James Tomkins injured and keeper Steve Mandanda left out of the squad. And while the England winger's effort could not be faulted, he failed to spark life into the side.\nBoss Alan Pardew's immediate concern will be the future of forward Yannick Bolasie, who was instrumental in Palace's impressive first-half of the 2015-16 campaign.\nEverton are in talks with the Eagles to sign Bolasie, and the DR Congo international came off the bench to a warm applause from the home support after 66 minutes.\n\"The deal is close and he will go with my best wishes. It's fair to say we know his heart and soul may be elsewhere,\" said Pardew of Bolasie's prospective move.\nBerahino committed despite possible exit\nSeven of West Brom's 10 Premier League wins last season finished 1-0 and with a new campaign, and a prospective new owner in Chinese businessman Guochuan Lai, came a familiar result.\nGuochuan provided the 2,000 travelling Albion fans with free scarves, but the victory would have provided the more welcome fillip to supporters who grew restless at times last season with the style of football played under Pulis.\nThe Baggies named their only summer signing in the starting line-up - with winger Matt Phillips making a lively start before drifting out of the game - but Pulis has reiterated his intention to bring in five more players before the end of August.\nRondon, top scorer for West Brom last season, added to his 10 league goals for the club with a clever finish, but doubt over the future of his strike partner Saido Berahino continues.\nStoke are reportedly interested in the 23-year-old, who is out of contract at the end of the season but looked committed until he was taken off with five minutes to go.\n\"He won't be leaving unless we bring someone in,\" was Pulis' assessment of Berahino's potential move.\nMan of the match - Salomon Rondon\nWhat they said\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"We lacked a cutting edge, a moment, today. If we had scored first, we would've won.\n\"I thought we were pretty strong defensively, they didn't have many chances.\n\"West Brom are never easy, they camp the midfield, make it hard at the back and of course - set plays.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"It was not a fluke. I think we deserved it. Palace never created a lot, they had just long range shots really. I'm very pleased.\n\"It is more important that we stay in the Premier League and Saido Berahino's goals will help us do that. We're hoping and praying we can keep him.\"\nWhat's up next?\nWest Brom host Everton, while Palace go to Tottenham next Saturday - two teams who drew 1-1 with each other on the opening day.\nThe stats you need to know\nSince Tony Pulis took charge on 10 January 2015, West Brom have kept 22 clean sheets in the top flight, a haul only Arsenal (26), Man City (23) and Man Utd (23) can better.\nWest Brom's past 11 Premier League wins have all been by a one-goal margin.\nCrystal Palace have now lost 13 Premier League games in 2016 (level with Norwich), a figure only Aston Villa (14) can better.\nThe Eagles have won only one of their past nine season openers held at Selhurst Park (D4 L4)."

Three months ago we were in the Championship and played today against a team that has finished ninth in the Premier League in the last three seasons.\n\"For us it was a difficult test, a good test, with all the pressure of the first game in the Premier League, but I'm really pleased.\n\"Alvaro and Gaston are the reflection of the team. It's easier to play the way they have played, as individuals, when you know how important the team is for everyone.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I thought we acquitted ourselves well and tried to create things. We finished strongly so that's encouraging. On another day with a little more care we could have scored more goals.\n\"Overall we restricted them as a home side. We calmed the crowd and didn't allow Middlesbrough to build any momentum.\n\"Quite clearly Joe Allen is outstanding and he'll be a mainstay of this side for a long time. He can build his career here now.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNegredo has now scored with his first shot on target in the Premier League for both Man City and Middlesbrough.\nShaqiri scored Stoke's first direct free-kick goal in the Premier League since October 2013 (Marko Arnautovic vs Man Utd).\nStoke are winless in their last seven Premier League season openers, drawing three and losing four.\nStoke have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 11 Premier League games; only in August 2012 have they endured a longer run without one (12 games).\nGiven is the third oldest player to appear in the opening matchday of a Premier League season (40y 115d), after Brad Friedel (41y 92d) and Teddy Sheringham (40y 139d)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Sunderland\nPep Guardiola needed a late Paddy McNair own goal to make a winning start at Manchester City as David Moyes lost his first game as Sunderland manager.\nSergio Aguero's penalty, after Raheem Sterling was fouled by Patrick van Aanholt, gave City an early lead.\nBut Guardiola, who left England keeper Joe Hart out of his starting XI, saw his new side concede to Jermain Defoe.\nCity made few chances, but snatched an 87th-minute winner when debutant McNair headed into his own net.\nRecap the key moments of Man City's win over Sunderland\nPep's side need more punch\nIt had been 195 days since City announced Guardiola would succeed Manuel Pellegrini at Etihad Stadium, and results stagnated during that period, with five wins from last season's final 15 Premier League games leading to a fourth-placed finish.\nGuardiola, 45, arrived in Manchester with six league championships to his name - three each from his spells at Barcelona and Bayern Munich - and brings an expectation he will guide City to a first Premier League title since 2014.\nBut any hopes of an instant revolution were curtailed by a lethargic performance that lacked creative spark, despite dominating possession against a side that only avoided relegation in their penultimate game last season.\nAnd, while City may have required good fortune for the decisive goal - McNair heading in Jesus Navas' cross at the back post, it provides a winning platform for Guardiola, who was lacking injured first-team players Vincent Kompany, Samir Nasri, Nicolas Otamendi and new signings Leroy Sane and Ilkay Gundogan.\nGuardiola shows Hart-less streak\nHart's absence from the starting line-up is the most eye-catching decision of Guardiola's early days at City, and will raise the question whether the 29-year-old's 10-year stay at Etihad Stadium could be coming to an end.\nThe former Shrewsbury player has made 347 appearances for City, winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup, two League Cups and 63 England caps, but Guardiola opted to start with Willy Caballero.\nThe Argentine made a notable stop from a point-blank Defoe effort, before the striker slid home a cool finish.\nMidfielder Yaya Toure was left out of the squad altogether, but the influential Ivorian may have been saved for Tuesday's first leg of the Champions League qualifier at Steaua Bucharest.\nJohn Stones, a \u00a347.5m summer signing from Everton, looked composed at the heart of City's defence alongside Aleksandar Kolarov, and fellow debutant Nolito put in an enthusiastic performance on the wing.\nSunderland can take encouragement\nSunderland's preparations for the new season were torn apart by manager Sam Allardyce's decision to leave for the vacant England job, but his departure opened the door for Moyes' return to the Premier League.\nThe Scot's reputation was knocked by a difficult year as Manchester United boss, followed by an equally chastening 12 months at Real Sociedad.\nBut he could well be liberated by the shift in pressure from replacing the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford to starting out at a club looking to improve on last season's 17th-placed finish.\nThree of Moyes' four summer signings featured, Donald Love starting at right-back, and Adnan Januzaj and McNair coming off the bench, but the latter's debut will be remembered for the own goal he scored just three minutes and 35 seconds after coming on.\nDespite rarely seeing the ball, Sunderland restricted the hosts' chances and will be buoyed by the quality of their goal - Defoe scoring in his 16th Premier League season by slotting home from a Jack Rodwell through-ball.\nMan of the match - Fernandinho\nWhat they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It was tough for everybody and that is why people say the Premier League is tough. We were constant and we deserved the victory.\n\"All of the new signings were a team so we fight. We spoke many times what we should do like a team - this is just the first step.\n\"But, of course, for the new people, new manager, new players to start winning helps to believe in what we are doing.\"\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"You couldn't deny that City were the better team because of the players and the football they played but we did everything we could to make their football difficult for them.\n\"For long periods we did a great job at it, but it is disappointing that we gave away the second goal.\n\"But I can't be critical of the players because they did a great job defensively and all-round really - just disappointed we didn't get a point.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to Romania on Tuesday for the first leg of their Champions League qualifier against Steaua Bucharest, before going to Stoke in the league on Saturday. Sunderland host promoted Middlesbrough on Sunday, 21 August.\nThe stats you need to know\nCity have won their past five Premier League meetings with Sunderland.\nSunderland have never won at City in the Premier League (W0 D2 L11).\nAguero is the top-scoring player in the Premier League so far in 2016 (18 goals in 19 games).\nGuardiola has won the opening league game of the season as a manager in each of his past seven seasons (three for Barcelona, three for Bayern, one for City).\nOnly Alan Shearer (11) has scored more Premier League goals against City than Defoe (eight - level with Wayne Rooney, Robbie Keane and Ian Rush).\nMcNair was the first player to score an own goal on his Premier League debut for a team since Danny Gabbidon for QPR exactly five years ago"

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester United\nJose Mourinho made a winning Premier League start as Manchester United manager with a comprehensive opening victory at Bournemouth.\nJuan Mata, who was substituted after coming on in last week's Community Shield, opened the scoring with a tap-in after Simon Francis' error.\nWayne Rooney headed the second before Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked his United league debut with a goal from 25 yards.\nAdam Smith scored a consolation goal for the Cherries.\nUnited were without world-record \u00a389m signing Paul Pogba through suspension, while midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan started on the bench, with Mata preferred.\nRelive the action from Vitality Stadium\nCan Mourinho bring back the fear factor?\nAs starts go, this was a highly satisfactory day for United - the Mourinho era began with a solid victory at a ground where they came unstuck under Louis van Gaal last season.\nUnited started slowly and did not register a shot on target until a Rooney effort produced a comfortable save from Artur Boruc in the 27th minute.\nYet it was job done once the visitors opened the scoring with a messy goal and added two more in the space of five second-half minutes to put them in a commanding position.\nMata looked unhappy when he was replaced 30 minutes after coming on at Wembley against Leicester last Sunday but the Spaniard was all smiles as he got Mourinho's reign up and running.\nBoruc made a fine block from Mata after Francis' under-hit back-pass but the rebound bounced off Francis into the former Chelsea player's path and he tapped home.\nUnited's second goal was also down to some good fortune - Rooney was well positioned to head home after Anthony Martial's mis-hit shot fell perfectly for his captain.\nIbrahimovic was denied by a one-handed Boruc save but the Swede made it 3-0 with a drilled low finish from outside the area to leave Mourinho smiling.\nIbrahimovic conjures another debut goal\nIbrahimovic continued his remarkable record of marking debuts with a goal.\nThe 34-year-old Swede has now scored on his first league starts in England, Italy, Spain and France, and in the Champions League.\nAny concerns the frenetic pace in English football's top-flight might not suit Ibrahimovic were dispelled with his well-executed finish to follow a goal at Wembley last week.\nIt was his third goal in total for his new club after scoring on his first appearance in a United shirt in a friendly against Galatasaray as well as the winner in the Community Shield against Leicester.\nMourinho's oldest signing of the summer could turn out to be his shrewdest.\nHow did the new players perform?\nBournemouth:\nJordon Ibe - Bournemouth's club-record \u00a315m signing from Liverpool looked a threat coming in off the right and driving through the middle. He also had a goal-bound shot blocked after twisting and turning inside the United area.\nLewis Cook - The 19-year-old midfield signing from Leeds United did not lack confidence and showed enough promise to suggest he could be a success in the Premier League.\nManchester United:\nEric Bailly - Solid league debut and made his presence felt very early on with a no-nonsense challenge on Joshua King. A commanding presence in defence.\nZlatan Ibrahimovic - Took a while to get going but, when he did, the former Paris St-Germain striker made an impact. Ibrahimovic was not afraid to go in where it hurts and was involved in an early clash of heads with Simon Francis while attempting to connect with Antonio Valencia's cross.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan - Came on for the final 15 minutes with the points in the bag. Replaced Juan Mata, who surprisingly started in place of the former Borussia Dortmund midfielder.\nMore signings for Bournemouth?\nEddie Howe has been one of the busiest top-flight managers in the transfer market this summer, having brought in six major signings.\nAnd while the Cherries made it hard for United in the first half before Francis' error, they were exposed by ruthless opponents after the break.\nThere is still work for Howe to do on his team and his next addition looks like being Marc Wilson, the Stoke City defender, for \u00a32m.\nBournemouth conceded 67 goals last season - more than relegated Newcastle - and they needed Boruc at his best to keep United from a more handsome win.\nThat needs addressing if Bournemouth, who scored when Smith found the top corner from 16 yards, are to stay out of the bottom three this season.\nMan of the match - Eric Bailly (Manchester United)\nWhat they said:\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was an even game until the first goal. You can't give Manchester United goals which we did.\n\"Credit to our boys. We kept fighting away and got the goal back and ended the game very strongly.\n\"I thought Jordon [Ibe] did well in flashes and showed what he is going to bring to us. He is a really exciting talent and there is more to come from him.\"\nIbrahimovic is more than a player - Mourinho\nThe game in numbers\n8: Only Alan Shearer and Frank Lampard (8) have scored more opening day Premier League goals than Wayne Rooney (7).\n1: Juan Mata scored his first Premier League goal under the management of Jose Mourinho (no goals in 13 Premier League games for Chelsea in 2013-14, before leaving for Manchester United).\n0: Jose Mourinho has never lost an opening day fixture in the Premier League (W7 D1).\n11: Bournemouth have now gone 11 Premier League games without keeping a clean sheet.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth look to bounce back when they provide the opposition for West Ham's first Premier League game at London Stadium on 21 August (16:00 BST). United welcome Southampton to Old Trafford on Friday.(20:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-4 Liverpool\nLiverpool held on to beat Arsenal in a stunning Premier League opening-weekend encounter at Emirates Stadium.\nTheo Walcott fired in the first goal for the Gunners in the 31st minute, moments after missing a penalty.\nPhilippe Coutinho equalised with a brilliant free-kick before Adam Lallana fired in after the break.\nCoutinho poked in his second and Sadio Mane slammed home, before Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a great solo goal and Calum Chambers headed in.\nAnalysis: Arsenal showed character, Liverpool look a force\nRead: Lack of experience cost us - Wenger\nRelive a thrilling match at the Emirates Stadium\nBrilliant goals light up brilliant encounter\nIt was billed as the best game of the Premier League opening weekend and more than lived up to expectations.\nAfter quite a dour 30 minutes, Alberto Moreno's second defensive mistake lit the flame for the encounter that followed.\nIt was the second half that will long live in the memory. Four of the five goals were exceptional.\nThere was Lallana's chest control and strike followed by a 19-pass move finished off by Coutinho. Mane then capped off an impressive debut with a goal reminiscent of his strikes at Southampton - driving at the defence before a fierce finish.\nAnd substitute Oxlade-Chamberlain then produced a delightful cameo when he dazzled the Liverpool backline and then slotted past Simon Mignolet.\nChambers' header left Liverpool wondering whether a great win would become 'what could have been' - but they hung on.\nWhere does this leave Arsenal?\nDuring the 2013-14 season, the Gunners capitulated horribly on three occasions in the league - conceding six against Manchester City and Chelsea and five against Liverpool.\nHome fans watching must have thought it was a case of history repeating when, from 1-0 up in the first half through Walcott's drilled effort, they were 4-1 down by the 63rd minute.\nThe difference between then and now is that Arsenal are a far more potent proposition in attack, which is why the Reds were left celebrating a narrow win rather than a mauling.\nIt is the issues at the back that appear to be a perennial problem. On Sunday they were without injured senior defenders Per Mertesacker and Gabriel, while Laurent Koscielny is still not match fit after his exploits at Euro 2016.\nThat meant manager Arsene Wenger was forced to play Rob Holding, 20, a \u00a32m summer signing from Bolton, alongside Calum Chambers, 21, in central defence.\nTheir inexperience was brutally exposed by Liverpool's attack in the second half. The question is whether Wenger dips into the transfer market or waits for his senior players to return. The fans will want the former.\nHas time already run out for Moreno?\nThe reaction on social media was damning and who knows what his manager Jurgen Klopp was thinking.\nLiverpool's full-back Moreno had a match to forget after twice making crucial mistakes. He should have been punished by Walcott for his first - a wild lunge on the England forward inside the area which resulted in the penalty. Simon Mignolet's save bailed him out.\nHis second error was arguably more inexplicable when he allowed Walcott acres of space on the right of the box - before the England winger drilled his angled effort past the Belgian keeper.\nDerided by his own fans last season, memorably for his performance in the Europa League final, the 24-year-old Spaniard's display is surely now giving Klopp food for thought with the transfer window shutting in two weeks.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger:\n\"We lacked experience at the back and we were physically short. Liverpool did well and we were for 15 minutes completely shocked.\nWe pushed players today like Aaron Ramsey. It is an impossible situation to get players back from the Euros and prepare.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"I played a big part in the excitement of the last half-hour, because it's not allowed to celebrate the fourth goal like this with 35 minutes to go.\n\"At this moment, we switched off the machines. The game was not over. Arsenal lost, but we gave them a path back into the game.\n\"Nothing is sure until the final whistle. Over the whole of the 90 minutes it was a deserved win.\n\"We can always score goals and we can defend much better. It's the Premier League and nothing should be easy in this league. Nothing is easy.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal conceded four goals in a league game at the Emirates for the first time since May 2009 (4-1 v Chelsea).\nArsenal v Liverpool has seen more penalties missed than any other fixture in Premier League history (seven).\nMignolet has saved five of the 11 penalties he has faced in the Premier League, more than any other Liverpool goalkeeper.\nWalcott has scored in 10 different Premier League seasons for Arsenal; only Dennis Bergkamp (11) has scored in more for the Gunners.\nThirteen of Philippe Coutinho's 30 goals for Liverpool in all competitions have been scored from outside the box.\nArsenal had three different English scorers in the same Premier League game for the first time since October 1997 against Barnsley (Parlour, Platt and Wright).\nThis is the first time since 1953-54 in the English top flight that the two top from the previous season have both lost their opening game.\nWhat's next?\nThe Gunners face champions Leicester next Saturday at 17:30 BST at the King Power Stadium. On the same day Liverpool are away again, this time at Burnley - that match kicks off at 15:00 BST."

We did very well and we played 90 minutes like tigers.\n\"It's not every year I score in my first game. Last season is finished - we are looking forward to the future. We want to bring a lot of emotion to the fans.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic told Sky Sports: \"When you lose a game and concede late, of course you are disappointed. Apart from the first 15 minutes until we equalised, they were much better than us.\n\"They were better on the ball, in pressing and much more aggressive than us. They had the individual class of Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Willian.\n\"We came back into the game. We played well after 1-1, but we made the mistake in the middle of the park. We gave the ball away and conceded a cheap goal.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Watford on Saturday after the Hornets started the season with a draw at Southampton. West Ham have a trip to Romania on Thursday for the first leg of their Europa League qualifier against Astra Giurgiu."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-0 Southampton\nZlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice on his home debut as Manchester United claimed a comfortable Premier League win over Southampton at Old Trafford.\nThe Swedish striker headed home Wayne Rooney's cross from the right.\nHe scored from the penalty spot after Jordy Clasie tripped Luke Shaw, his third goal in two league games since joining on a free transfer this summer.\nPaul Pogba, United's \u00a389m world-record signing from Juventus, made an energetic full league debut.\nThe victory was United's second in succession in the league this season after their opening-day win at Bournemouth.\nReaction - Mourinho praises \"fantastic\" Pogba\nZlatan makes his presence felt\nIbrahimovic's force of personality could be every bit as much of an asset as his ability to United this season.\nThe 34-year-old, signed on a free transfer after leaving Paris St-Germain at the end of last season, marked his home debut with a confident display that brought warm appreciation from the home supporters.\nHaving scored in the Community Shield win over Leicester City and United's Premier League weekend victory at Bournemouth, Ibrahimovic went into the match in fine form.\nThe Swede's movement was significant in a United attack that looks far livelier than it did under the management of Louis van Gaal last season.\nIntriguingly, Ibrahimovic appears to have bumped captain Wayne Rooney from penalty duties. He was quick to take on the responsibility when United were awarded a spot-kick; his finish was his 25th successful conversion from his last 28 attempts.\nPogba eases his way in\nPogba's return to Old Trafford, four years after he left for Juventus without having made a Premier League start, has been eagerly awaited by United fans this summer.\nHis second debut for the club was delayed because of a suspension held over from his time in Italy but, with that served, manager Jose Mourinho tried to warn supporters against expecting too much too soon.\nThe midfielder is still getting back to full speed, having been given a break after helping France reach the Euro 2016 final - and that showed in his performance.\nHowever, there was plenty of evidence to suggest that Mourinho was right to spend so much money to bring Pogba back to Old Trafford. His display was a positive one, with more touches and more passes in the opposing half than any team-mate.\nOne surging run towards the end of the first half left four Southampton players in his wake, and demonstrated his power, while a second-half header from a Juan Mata corner flew just over the bar.\nHe did fade as the match reached its later stages - undoubtedly a result of the fact that he has not had a proper pre-season - but the Frenchman summoned up enough energy to blast a shot wide at the end of a late counter-attack.\nA goal would have rounded off Pogba's night perfectly, but he was happy enough. For him, victory was the perfect way to celebrate the 26th birthday of his brother, Partick Thistle striker Mathias Pogba.\nSouthampton's Old Trafford run ends\nAnother summer has brought yet another squad overhaul at Southampton, with Sadio Mane, Graziano Pelle and Victor Wanyama all leaving the club, along with manager Ronald Koeman.\nClaude Puel, Koeman's replacement, is still finding his feet in the Premier League, and the same could be said of the reshaped squad he leads.\nThe visitors had their moments at Old Trafford, with Shane Long going close and Dusan Tadic seeing a goal ruled out for a push moments before Ibrahimovic's decisive second.\nLosing midfielder Oriol Romeu to an early injury did not help them, but having won 1-0 on each of their last two visits to Old Trafford, they rarely looked likely to extend that run.\nMan of the match - Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Man Utd)\nIbrahimovic was the star of Ligue 1 last season, scoring 50 goals in all competitions last season as Paris St-Germain completed a domestic clean sweep.\nHis self-confidence has never been in question, but there were doubts as to whether he could be prolific in the Premier League at the age of 34.\nHowever, his fine start at Old Trafford has given United fans plenty of reason for cheer.\nReaction\nManchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's a great feeling. I'm very happy. It's my brother's birthday so I am happier.\n\"I was relaxed, no nerves, I played my game. The first ball of the match, I lost it, but got used to it. After that, I felt better.\n\"I came here to win, that is what I always wanted. It's a top club. We need to get used to winning and carry on like this. We dream big. United are a big club, I know we will do big things this season.\"\nSouthampton striker Shane Long: \"They are a good side, but I thought we played well. We passed the ball around well, but it took us a bit of time to get going again.\n\"We need to change that. We need to be right at teams from the start. We'll learn from this. We caused them some problems and we can look at some positives.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nZlatan Ibrahimovic has struck 13 goals in his last eight league games against teams managed by Claude Puel - having been prolific for previous club Paris St-Germain against Puel's Nice.\nThree of Ibrahimovic's last six league goals have been with his head - this after none of his previous 19 had come through headers.\nManchester United have not lost a league home game after leading at half-time since May 1984 (1-2 vs Ipswich).\nPaul Pogba made his first Premier League appearance for Manchester United since 18 March 2012, 1,616 days ago.\nWayne Rooney made his 600th club appearance in this match (523 for Man Utd, 77 for Everton).\nManchester United have not lost a home league game on a Friday since April 1950, when they lost 2-0 to Birmingham, winning 14 and drawing six games since.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United have a Saturday trip to Hull City on 27 August, with Southampton at home to Sunderland on the same day."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 1-4 Manchester City\nSergio Aguero and Nolito scored twice as Manchester City resisted Stoke's second-half comeback to continue their winning start under Pep Guardiola.\nCity led when Aguero converted from the spot - despite missing two penalties on Tuesday - with his second deftly nodded in from Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick.\nBojan lifted the hosts with the game's second penalty - both awarded for tugging in the box.\nBut Nolito came on to score two late goals and seal City's win.\nThe Spanish forward tucked in fellow sub Kelechi Iheanacho's cut-back from close range with four minutes to play, before punishing Stoke again in the fifth minute of stoppage time when played through by Raheem Sterling.\nIt was a deserved victory for the away side, who were totally dominant in the first half and rarely seriously threatened after the break.\nGuardiola 'surprised' by Man City quality\n, external\nA tale of two penalties\nStoke manager Mark Hughes was furious after referee Mike Dean awarded City a penalty in the first half and Ryan Shawcross's shirt pull on Nicolas Otamendi was the kind of challenge at a corner that regularly gets ignored.\nBut he had a rather different reaction when Dean punished Sterling for the same offence, with Shawcross the victim this time.\nCity followed up their opener from the spot with a slickly taken second, but Stoke failed to build on the momentum that followed Bojan's conversion.\nThe final scoreline in Guardiola's third game in charge was perhaps slightly flattering on City, who were excellent in the first half but sloppier for much of the second.\nThe obsession and intensity\nCity began with the two Guardiola trademarks in abundance. Careful in possession and quick to close the opposition down, it was an impressive start.\nBut the one position where Guardiola has clearly already identified room for improvement is in goal. Joe Hart was again left out in favour of Willy Caballero and the England international appears set to leave the club, particularly after Barcelona revealed later on Saturday that they have reached an agreement with City for Claudio Bravo to move to Etihad Stadium.\nThat leaves Hart facing the prospect of being third choice.\nIn Friday's news conference, Guardiola said Hart will improve if he stays at City but added that he was \"obsessive\" about build-up play and wants his keeper to play a significant part.\nThere was a clear grimace from the Spaniard when Caballero fluffed a clearance out of play, but the Argentine was otherwise solid.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\nThe Argentina striker showed character to convert from the spot after missing two penalties in Tuesday's Champions League play-off first leg. The 28-year-old scored a hat-trick in that 5-0 victory, and his two goals against Stoke take him to six from the first three games of the season.\nWhat the managers said\nStoke City boss Mark Hughes: \"The penalties were key, especially the one that went against us in the first half when we were in the match. There's a new directive as there often is at this time of the season. It went against us and knocked the wind out of our sails.\n\"Our penalty probably would not have been given this time last year, but we got back into the game until that third goal took it away from us. But I don't think the score was a true reflection of the game.\n\"City are clearly a top team this year, but we didn't get the key details right and it went against us.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"I realise how good the players are, I am a lucky guy because the quality of the players here is amazing.\n\"They run and fight for each other, and today we played in one of the toughest places of the season. It was a pity we created a lot in the second half but the last pass was not correct.\n\"Often we arrived in the right moment which is what we are looking for but we didn't finish. It's OK, we are going to improve. Our back four was very good but everyone was excellent.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSince his debut in August 2008, no player has given away more penalties than Ryan Shawcross (nine, level with Sebastien Bassong).\nShawcross is the first Premier League player to concede and win a penalty in the same game since Theo Walcott in August 2011.\nSince the start of last season, Mike Dean has awarded more penalties than any other referee in the Premier League (16).\nWilly Caballero has kept just five clean sheets in 24 games for Manchester City (all comps).\nSergio Aguero has scored eight times in seven Premier League appearances against Stoke City.\nKevin De Bruyne has 14 assists since debuting for Manchester City (all comps), four more than any other player at the club.\nWhat's next?\nMan City are back in European action on Tuesday in the second leg of their Champions League play-off with Romanian side Steaua Bucharest - and could rest players after winning the first leg 5-0.\nStoke also play on Tuesday - away to League Two club Stevenage in the EFL Cup second round."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-2 Chelsea\nDiego Costa scored the winner for the second game in a row as Chelsea came from behind to beat Watford at Vicarage Road.\nEtienne Capoue had put the Hornets ahead on 56 minutes as the hosts looked in control of the game.\nBut substitute Michy Batshuayi equalised with his first goal for Chelsea since his \u00a333m move.\nThen Costa ran on to substitute Cesc Fabregas' pass and slid the ball under Heurelho Gomes with three minutes left.\nThe win gives Chelsea boss Antonio Conte a 100% start in the Premier League after Monday's victory against West Ham.\nHow Chelsea beat Watford\nReaction to all of Saturday's games\nInspired substitutions\nChelsea seemed to be running out of ideas before Conte made his first change on 71 minutes, with the visitors registering just one shot on target.\nBut within seven minutes the Italian had rolled the dice and brought on Victor Moses, Batshuayi and Fabregas.\nBatshuayi opened his Premier League account just seven minutes after coming on, reacting fastest when Heurelho Gomes spilled Eden Hazard's shot to score.\nFabregas, an unused substitute against West Ham, then found Costa with a perfectly-weighted pass through the Watford defence - and the Spain striker did the rest.\nMazzarri loses again to his old foe\nConte and Walter Mazzarri met seven times in Serie A as managers, with the new Watford boss only coming out on top once - and that was in 2010.\nThe build-up was dominated by the rivalry between the two Italians and Conte admitted the pair fell out during their time coaching Napoli and Juventus respectively.\nAnd Mazzarri seemed to have his tactics spot on for 80 minutes of the match. His side pressed well and nullified the attacking trio of Pedro, Oscar and Hazard. Wingers Jose Holebas and Nordin Amrabat also caused Chelsea's full-backs plenty of problems.\nDespite Chelsea enjoying almost two-thirds of the possession, Watford thoroughly deserved the lead when Capoue controlled Adlene Guedioura's cross with his chest and, with acres of space in the box, rifled a left-foot shot high into the net.\nBut Conte sparked Chelsea into life with his changes, Watford eventually succumbing to the Blues' relentless pressure.\nShould Costa have still been on the pitch?\nThere were some suggestions that, for the second match running, Costa was lucky to have been still on the pitch to score the winner.\nThe 27-year-old had already been booked for dissent after Watford's goal and just 10 minutes later he appeared to dive in the area but referee Jon Moss waved play on.\nAgainst West Ham, Costa escaped a second booking when he caught Hammers keeper Adrian on the shin with a late challenge but went on to score the winner.\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted:\n, external\n\"Costa scores the winner in the first 2 games. Costa lucky to stay on the pitch in the first 2 games.\"\nSpeaking after the Watford win, Conte said: \"If every game people find something on Diego it is no good for Chelsea, for Diego, it's better to focus on the game and the match.\n\"For me, the first yellow is no good. I don't accept the idea for a second yellow card for a dive but he does have to avoid the first.\"\nMan of the match - Michy Batshuayi\nWhat they managers said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"I'm pleased to see the reaction from my players and this win is very important for us as it gives everyone confidence. I don't know what was wrong in the first half - but I repeat that every game in this league is tough.\n\"It is wrong to come to Watford and to think it's very simple to win. In the first half I saw a good balance between the teams.\n\"I think we showed a great intensity in the second half and we pushed them a lot. I'm pleased for the substitutes. They didn't start but they showed great attitude and commitment with Fabregas and Batshuayi making a real impact.\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"I am happy for how we played for 70-80 minutes because we played very well but I am not happy with the result.\n\"They scored two goals that could have been avoided. We are a team that still has room to grow and there is margin for improvement.\n\"The new players can help us a lot and they can help us improve as a team. We played very well so the way we played in the first half, we could have scored twice.\"\nStats you need to know\nSince returning to the Premier League in 2014, Cesc Fabregas has more assists than any other player (26)\nHazard collected just his second assist in 26 Premier League appearances\nCapoue has scored in successive Premier League games, having scored once in 57 league games before that\nConte has lost just one of his last 32 league games as a club manager - won 29 drawn two\nChelsea have kept just one clean sheet in their past eight Premier League away games\nWhat's next?\nChelsea entertain League One side Bristol Rovers in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, with Burnley the visitors to Stamford Bridge in the league on Saturday.\nWatford will look to bounce back against Gillingham in the League Cup, followed by the visit of Arsenal on Saturday."

Philippe Coutinho starred as Liverpool's forward play gave them victory last week - but he was a long way short of his best on this occasion.\nTime and time again the Brazilian picked up the ball in space on the edge of the Burnley area looking to bend in one of his trademark spectacular goals but, of his 10 strikes from similar range, only one brought a save from Tom Heaton.\nOur decision making was not good - Klopp\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told Match of the Day: \"Our decision making was not good. We'd put in a good cross but there were no bodies in the box and then when we had bodies in the box we ended up shooting.\n\"The season is still pretty young. It doesn't look like we are 100% fine-tuned. But it's only the start of the season and I can see a lot of good things.\n\"The lesson here is don't give the ball away like we did twice today. We will work on it 100%. We need to have a plan for deep defending teams. We have a few things to do - that is clear.\"\nBurnley out-run Liverpool as they hold out\nAs poor as Liverpool were given their amount of possession, credit must also go to Burnley for the work-rate throughout their team as well as their organisation and resolve at the back.\nThe Clarets out-ran Liverpool by 115.3km to 113km - and that industry was key to them defending their lead and securing the points.\nWhen Liverpool did put balls into the box, Michael Keane and Ben Mee dealt with everything that came their way, ensuring Heaton was rarely tested.\nHis best save came from Roberto Firmino in the second half but, typically, that came from a long-distance shot.\nBurnley's strikers also deserve praise, with Vokes and Gray both able to celebrate the first top-flight goals of their career.\nThey barely had a kick for much of the game, but kept running and kept stretching Liverpool's defenders when Burnley were able to counter-attack.\nWe have never been bogged down by possession stats - Dyche\n\"I thought we made Liverpool look uncomfortable,\" Burnley boss Sean Dyche told Match of the Day. \"We think we can be a threat to teams.\n\"We have never been bogged down with all the stats about possession. There is something marvellous when you see someone give everything to the cause. That's what I thought we did.\"\nMan of the match - George Boyd (Burnley)\nWhat next?\nLiverpool's road trip continues, first with a journey to Burton in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, and then a tough-looking task at Tottenham in the Premier League next weekend.\nBurnley are also on their travels. They leave Turf Moor for the first time for the short trip to Accrington in their EFL Cup second-round tie on Wednesday, then head to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea on Saturday.\nThe stats you need to know\nThe Clarets won their first league game against Liverpool since September 1974, having gone seven without a win since then.\nSam Vokes became the first Burnley player to score a league goal against Liverpool at Turf Moor since Ray Hankin in March 1975 - they had failed in six games since then.\nBurnley scored more in this game than they managed in seven previous home Premier League games.\nVokes scored his first Premier League goal in his 28th appearance in the competition.\nLiverpool have only kept one clean sheet in their past 11 away Premier League games (6-0 v Aston Villa).\nSince Jurgen Klopp took over, only Aston Villa (12) and West Ham (10) have had more errors leading to goals in the Premier League than Liverpool (nine)."

I think we fully deserved it.\n\"I am happy for Victor [Wanyama]. It's important to score and feel the love of the supporters, and I am happy with Vincent [Janssen] - he was fantastic and created a lot of chances.

We have lost on two set plays - we are a strong set play side and we will work on it and make sure it does not happen again.\n\"Benteke's going to give our fans and us belief.

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Everton\nGareth Barry's close-range header secured Ronald Koeman's first victory as Everton manager as they came from a goal down to win at West Brom.\nThe home side went in front inside 10 minutes as Gareth McAuley headed in a Craig Gardner corner at the far post.\nEverton carried more threat once Romelu Lukaku came on as a first-half substitute, and Kevin Mirallas rolled in an equaliser just before the break.\nBarry then forced the ball in after Mason Holgate's touch from a corner.\nRelive the action from The Hawthorns\nReaction to Saturday's results\nLukaku to stay at Everton - Koeman\nLukaku stays - and proves pivotal\nKoeman said after the match that Lukaku would be staying at Everton - good news for Everton fans concerned that the striker may return to former club Chelsea.\nThe Belgium international, bought by Everton for a club-record \u00a328m from Chelsea in 2014, was his team's top scorer last season, and his power up front played a significant part in turning the game around.\nKoeman's team were flailing in attack for much of the first half, with the 5ft 9in stature of Gerard Deulofeu proving little match for Albion's 6ft 5in centre-half Jonas Olsson.\nLukaku, still straining for fitness after a recent heel problem, was thrown on to give Olsson a rougher time, with Deulofeu switched to the right flank. It worked, even though the Belgian did not score himself.\nEverton, who dominated possession throughout, began to create more openings - and made them count. Lukaku passed up a great late chance to make sure of victory, as he was denied by a fine Ben Foster save, but his job was done.\nAlbion succeed and fall with the set-piece\nBefore kick-off Koeman was asked in a television interview if he had made special plans to counter West Brom's threat from set-pieces. He said that he had not.\nWhen McAuley headed in Gardner's corner early on, it looked as if Everton would pay for that approach.\nIt certainly raised hopes for Guochuan Lai, the Chinese businessman who led a takeover at Albion earlier this month, and who was watching his new club in person for the first time.\nAlbion were managing to make life uncomfortable for Everton's three-man central defence, despite having only around a third of the possession.\nYet if the loss of a goal seconds before half-time knocked the home side off their stride, it was the manner of Everton's second that was something of a surprise.\nHead coach Tony Pulis prides himself on having well-drilled teams, yet they were caught out defensively from a corner, with Barry getting free of his markers to turn in a loose ball that should have been dealt with.\nStrength in depth lets Everton mix and match\nPulis expressed concerns before the match about the strength of Everton's bench - which included Lukaku, Yannick Bolasie and Ashley Williams.\n\"It's a top-six bench,\" said the West Brom coach, who has struggled to strengthen his own squad during the summer, bringing in only winger Matt Phillips from QPR for \u00a35.5m.\nThe fact that Koeman had options in reserve undoubtedly helped. Winger Bolasie, signed from Crystal Palace during the week, was excellent after coming on, racing past Jonny Evans down the right to deliver a cross that Ross Barkley somehow headed wide with under 20 minutes to go.\nYet Everton's willingness to mix up their approach - not always the case when they played a possession-based game under Roberto Martinez last season - was also a factor in changing the game.\nTheir equaliser was straight out of the Martinez playbook, with Barry and Barkley exchanging quick passes to feed Mirallas, whose shot had just enough on it to beat Ben Foster.\nYet they were prepared to go direct to Lukaku when needed, and carried a threat at set-pieces, with Foster reacting well to save Ramiro Funes Mori's header from a free-kick seconds before Barry's winner.\nMan of the match - Gareth Barry (Everton)\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Brom have gone five home games without a win in the Premier League (D1 L4) for the first time since December 2014\nEverton have kept just one clean sheet in their last eight away games in the league\nSince the start of the 2012-13 season, no defender has scored more Premier League headed goals than Gareth McAuley (eight, along with John Terry)\nKevin Mirallas has scored three goals in his last five league games; as many as in his previous 25 beforehand\nMirallas has scored in each of his last three Premier League games at The Hawthorns\nGareth Barry scored his first away goal in the Premier League since August 2011 (for Manchester City against Bolton)\nEverton fielded their first unchanged line-up in the Premier League since February 2016 (also against West Bromwich Albion)\nWhat's next?\nThe EFL Cup is next up for both teams on Tuesday: Everton host League Two side Yeovil, while West Brom go to Northampton, of League One."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-0 Arsenal\nPremier League champions Leicester City and last season's runners-up Arsenal are still waiting for their first win of the new campaign after a goalless stalemate at the King Power Stadium.\nBoth teams were aiming to bounce back from opening-weekend losses, to Hull City and Liverpool respectively, but could not find a breakthrough in a fiercely-contested game.\nReferee Mark Clattenburg was the villain for Leicester fans after denying strong penalty claims in each half, first when Laurent Koscielny tangled with Danny Drinkwater then late on when Hector Bellerin appeared to upend Ahmed Musa.\nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy failed to punish the club he turned down this summer when he shot wide from close range as Claudio Ranieri's side started to exert a measure of control after the break.\nArsenal keeper Petr Cech saved crucially from Riyad Mahrez in the dying seconds while Arsenal had opportunities of their own as they enjoyed the better of the first half, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain shooting narrowly wide.\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nAngry Arsenal fans voice their displeasure\nArsenal fans were not celebrating a hard-earned point at the final whistle - they were busy venting their fury at manager Arsenal Wenger's lack of activity in the transfer market.\nWenger was urged, loudly and in very industrial terms, to start spending some money as Arsenal fought through a spell of late Leicester pressure.\nIt left Arsenal without a win from their first two games and means they are already five points behind Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea - and indeed Hull City.\nAnd there can be no doubt Arsenal's fans have a valid point when they question why Wenger has not beefed up his squad more, certainly with more than the \u00a335m acquisition of midfielder Granit Xhaka from Borussia Monchengladbach.\nWenger is hoping to complete a \u00a325m deal for Valencia's German central defender Shkodran Mustafi but there is also a need for further class in attack to augment, and perhaps replace, Olivier Giroud.\nThis is a defining season for Wenger so it could be said he faces a defining few days in the transfer market.\nArsenal's fans certainly know it. Wenger must surely know it too as he listened to those angry voices in the travelling support tucked away in a corner of the King Power Stadium\nLeicester going nowhere\nLeicester may not defy the odds and all logic to win the title this season - but there is no reason to believe they will simply fall away after the glory of that Premier League title campaign.\nRanieri's side may still be awaiting their first win of the season but there was plenty to suggest this will be another campaign to enjoy for the fervent Foxes fans who create such atmospheric surroundings at the King Power Stadium.\nLeicester may not have been at their vibrant best but they matched Arsenal and showed real resilience and character to apply pressure themselves in the second half after the Gunners enjoyed the best of the first half.\nThey may have lost N'Golo Kante to Chelsea but Nampalys Mendy looked a decent replacement before his injury and, while Vardy and Mahrez could not apply finishing touches as they did last season, they will on enough occasions to win matches.\nAnd with the old firm of Wes Morgan and Robert Huth back together in central defence, some of the steel that was missing in defeat at Hull City - and that served them so well last term - was restored.\nKoscielny makes the difference\nArsenal's soft centre was brutally exposed by Liverpool in the 4-3 defeat at Emirates Stadium last Sunday - leading to much criticism of Wenger's decision not to play Laurent Koscielny.\nWenger decided Koscielny was not ready after his Euro 2016 exertions with France, even though Per Mertesacker and Gabriel were both long-term injury casualties. It backfired as both Calum Chambers and 20-year-old Rob Holding, a \u00a32m buy from Bolton, struggled badly.\nKoscielny's return brought authority to Arsenal's defence and also helped guide Holding through a spell of heavy Leicester pressure, particularly distinguishing himself with a lunge that forced Vardy to shoot high and wide.\nHe is a fixture in Arsenal's central defence - now Wenger must provide him with quality support.\nMan of the match - Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal)\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"I am very happy. We didn't concede. We closed very well all the space and created clear chances to score. It was a draw but I think our fans enjoyed the match. Vardy scored against Manchester United, and he works so hard. I am happy with him.\"\nOn the penalty appeals: \"Difficult to say. My philosophy is it's a penalty when the referee blows his whistle and that's it.\"\nOn the injury suffered by Mendys: \"I don't know how bad. the ankle twists a little. Tomorrow we will see.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"I think overall it was a good performance, a good match between two good teams. It was a game of top level intensity and I believe we responded well to last week's disappointment.\n\"Leicester are a good team - they did not win the league and only lose three games last season for nothing.\n\"We had to fight until the end. We could have lost or won it in the last 20 minutes. We wanted to win the game and we finished with five attacking players on the pitch.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis was the first 0-0 draw between Leicester City and Arsenal in the Premier League since January 2001.\nLeicester are on a 20-game winless run against Arsenal in the Premier League (D6 L14).\nArsenal have never lost a Premier League game at the King Power Stadium, drawing three and winning 5-2 there last season.\nLeicester City had their first shot on target of the game in the 92nd minute.\nLeicester are unbeaten in 16 home Premier League games (W10 D6) since losing 5-2 to Arsenal last season.\nThe last time Arsenal had just a single point after two Premier League games was in the 2011-12 season (they went on to finish third).\nVardy is still yet to register a shot in target in the Premier League this season.\nArsenal have drawn four away Premier League games in a row for the first time since August 2007.\nKasper Schmeichel is only the second Leicester goalkeeper to keep a Premier League clean sheet against Arsenal - the other was Simon Royce in January 2001.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester are away at Swansea next Saturday and the Gunners are at Watford - both 15:00 BST kick offs."

        "article_text": "Sunderland 1-2 Middlesbrough\nCristhian Stuani scored twice on his Premier League debut as Middlesbrough beat Sunderland in the first Wear-Tees league derby in seven and a half years.\nAlvaro Negredo assisted both goals, with Stuani's opener a brilliant 25-yard effort into the top corner.\nThe Spaniard then unselfishly squared to Stuani for their second.\nThe Black Cats improved in the second half and Patrick van Aanholt gave them hope when he turned home after Brad Guzan parried Duncan Watmore's shot.\n'I fear for Sunderland - even with Moyes in charge' - Kevin Kilbane's MOTD2 analysis\nDavid Moyes' side had been booed off after a first half which saw them fail to test Boro debutant Guzan, replacing the injured Victor Valdes.\nBut after a second-half revival, they almost had a draw when Guzan fumbled another shot, but Donald Love turned the rebound wide.\nRelive the game, plus reaction, here.\nNegredo continues impressive Boro start\nMiddlesbrough's summer signing of Negredo on loan, only a year after Valencia paid \u00a321.25m for the striker from Manchester City, caused some surprise.\nA haul of five goals in La Liga last season meant his \u00a3100,000-a-week wages would be a gamble for newly promoted Boro.\nBut a goal on his debut against Stoke was followed by another key performance. He set up the opener for Stuani, although the goal was very much of the Uruguayan's own making as he smashed home from distance.\nNegredo only assisted three goals in 40 games for Valencia last season, but had his second of the day when he could have gone alone. The 31-year-old Spain striker had space to shoot but instead, with goalkeeper Vito Mannone braced to attempt a save, Negredo rolled it across to Stuani to fire home.\nGame of two halves for Moyes\nSunderland boss Moyes decided to start with Paddy McNair, usually a defender, in midfield alongside Jack Rodwell. And when they needed a tactical reshuffle following an injury to centre-back John O'Shea, it was Rodwell, rather than McNair who dropped back to defence.\nBut when Moyes scrapped that experiment at half-time and replaced McNair with midfielder Jeremain Lens, they made a game of it.\nAfter the break they had more shots (14-3), more possession and more passes - having been behind on all of those counts in the first half.\nBut with 34-year-old debutant Steven Pienaar the only Sunderland player other than Jermain Defoe to have more than 10 Premier League goals in his career, they rarely looked like scoring - with the exception of Van Aanholt's goal.\nMan of the match - Cristhian Stuani\nManager reaction - 'We are at bare bones'\nSunderland boss David Moyes told BBC Sport: \"I did not think we deserved to be 2-0 down at half-time. After we lost John O'Shea, we did not get quite sorted. We did not take some chances but they did.\n\"We played well, we had a great level of intensity but ran out with 10 minutes to go. We have so many young boys and are at the bare bones. The boys did try to win and score in the second half but were unlucky.\n\"I took positives from the first half, we played well. Overall, they were fine.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"The most important thing as always is the points. It's always important to win, especially in a derby and for our crowd who have been waiting for this moment for a long time, so I'm pleased for the players and the crowd.\n\"The key was the first half. I told the players they would start at 150% but with players of the quality of Cristhian Stuani we were able to score a first goal like that which opened up the game.\n\"In the second half we had problems but that's normal. The players showed we are ready for the season. We are playing well, compact and with intensity so it was important to get points as quickly as possible.\"\nMatch stats - Stuani joins Rashford's club\nMiddlesbrough have won eight and drawn one of the nine competitive games that Cristhian Stuani has scored in for them. He scored the goal to clinch their promotion last season.\nThe Uruguayan became the 26th player to score at least two goals on their Premier League debut and the first since Marcus Rashford in February.\nAlvaro Negredo assisted two goals in the same league appearance for the first time since September 2013 - in the Manchester derby.\nThis is the first matchday that all three newly promoted Premier League teams have won since 19-20 December 2015.\nThis result ended a run of 12 successive defeats away from home for Middlesbrough in the Premier League and was their first win on the road in the competition since November 2008 (v Aston Villa).\nSunderland's Patrick van Aanholt (4) has scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than any other defender.\nWhat's next for both clubs?\nThe North East rivals are both in EFL Cup second-round action on Wednesday. Boro go to Fulham, with the Black Cats hosting Shrewsbury.\nSunderland's next league game is at Southampton on Saturday, while Boro go to West Brom the next day."

The Cherries have lost their opening two games to slip to the bottom of the table.\nThey created very little against West Ham and tested goalkeeper Adrian just twice through King - the second in stoppage time when the Spaniard got down well to save.\nClub-record signing Jordon Ibe showed flashes of his talent with his direct running, but fluffed a big chance in the second half when he squared the ball rather than shooting when in front goal.\nOnce midfielder Arter was dismissed - his first yellow card for dissent towards the assistant referee, and second for dragging back Cheikhou Kouyate - Bournemouth dropped closer to their own area and were soon punished.\nWhat they said:\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"It was difficult, we knew it would be. The guys did brilliantly. Bournemouth were better than us in the first 15 minutes of the second half but they didn't hurt us.\n\"We just deserved it. We were pushing and wanted it more. We're delighted to end the first game at this beautiful stadium with a win and a clean sheet.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It was a tight game with little goalmouth action. It was going to swing on a moment of brilliance or a mistake. Unfortunately the mistake for us was going down to 10 men.\n\"We've been told about dissent - it's been drilled into us. If we lose our discipline we could have a flurry of red cards. Unfortunately we fell victim to that. The first booking has really cost us.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Ham host Romanian side Astra Giurgiu in the second leg of their Europa League qualifying play-off match on Thursday (kick-off 19:45 BST). The match is tied 1-1 after the first leg.\nBournemouth travel to Morecambe in the EFL Cup on Tuesday at 19:45 BST.\nThe stats you need to know\nThe London Stadium became the 55th different venue to host a Premier League match\nMichail Antonio scored in West Ham's final Premier League match at Upton Park and netted their first league goal at the London Stadium\nSeven of Antonio's nine Premier League goals for West Ham have come at home\nAntonio has scored a joint league-high seven headed goals since the start of the 2015-16 season (level with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud)"

Liverpool are a team who want to play and win titles and I think we are in the same way. It was a fair result.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"When you take a point at Tottenham for 99% of teams it would be a good thing but we saw the game different. We played a very good away game against a very strong side. We showed we can be good. We played football and defended really good.\"\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break Tottenham travel to Stoke City on Saturday, 10 September hoping for a similar result to the emphatic 4-0 victory they secured at the Britannia Stadium last season.\nWith Liverpool's redevelopment of Anfield nearing completion, Klopp's side will play their first home fixture of the season against Premier League champions Leicester City in the tea-time kick-off on the same day.\nThe stats you need to know\nJames Milner has scored in 42 Premier League games without losing. Only Darius Vassell (46 games) has scored in more without defeat.\nMilner has scored against Spurs with three different clubs (Aston Villa, Newcastle and Liverpool).\nTottenham scored their first goal against Liverpool at White Hart Lane in 416 minutes of Premier League football - their previous goal was by Gareth Bale in November 2012.\nLiverpool are without an away Premier League clean sheet in eight games, their longest run since November 2006.\nDanny Rose has scored six of his eight Premier League goals at White Hart Lane, including each of the last five.\nHarry Kane has played 10 Premier League games in the month of August without scoring a single goal.\nReferee Robert Madley has now awarded 15 penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season, only Mike Dean (16) has awarded more.\nThis fixture has now seen the joint-most penalties taken in Premier League history (20, level with Everton v Newcastle)."

The organisational things are still missing and two starting players were out last minute and this really didn't help.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We had a good cushion at half-time. At the moment we are not completely there physically and could see that in the second half.\n\"Ozil is not physically there completely but what we want from Ozil is assists and goals and I hope he can get that this season, 10 or 15 goals plus the chances he creates.\n\"We have bought two players - Mustafi and Perez. They will integrate into the team now and we will help them join the squad. We had to work very hard to get signings done. We have not got any plans for anyone else now.\"\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\nThe stats you need to know\nAlexis Sanchez has scored in all three of his Premier League appearances versus Watford, while also assisting two goals in these matches.\nThis was the first league game at Vicarage Road that Watford have conceded three goals in the first half since December 2007 v QPR.\nOnly Norwich (10) have given away more penalties in the Premier League since the start of 2015-16 than Watford (nine).\nWatford have lost all seven of their games against Arsenal in the Premier League.\nThe Hornets have now used 21 different players in the Premier League this season, with 17 different nationalities represented.\nArsenal had seven shots on target in this game, six of which were in the first half. Conversely, Watford attempted all six of their shots on target in the second half.\nWho's up next?\nAfter the international break, Watford travel to West Ham on Saturday, 10 September while Arsenal host Southampton."

The forward failed to create any chances, but did produce an overhead kick to clear Williams' header off the goalline.\nMOTD analysis on Lukaku\nRuud Gullit: \"He's working hard but looks off-sync. He gets in the right positions and I think it's just a matter of time.\"\nAlan Shearer: \"You have to stay strong and have the belief that something will go for you. You have to try to not lose confidence and it will change for him, it is just a matter of time.\"\nMan of the match - Ross Barkley (Everton)\nWhat they said\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"If you don't score the second and kill the game then it is always difficult in the last few minutes.\n\"Today we were not really clinical in the box. We had some good opportunities and need to be more aggressive, but the performance was good, it is a good start to the season and we can build on that.\n\"Two wins and one draw is very positive, but we can do much better and we need to improve in several aspects.\"\nOn the penalty that Everton were awarded, he added: \"It is so difficult to analyse that situation. There are enough reasons for Mark Hughes to be angry. If everyone whistles for these situations you would accept it, but one referee does and another one doesn't.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We are disappointed with the award of the penalty. I feared at the start of the season that some teams would not get a fair crack at the whip and that is happening to us. It is a very harsh decision in my view and that is two dubious penalties against us.\n\"I don't know what the referee has seen in terms of a clash. Ashley Williams is slightly ahead of Phil (Bardsley), ran across his path, there is a clash of legs, he goes down and we are penalised. All we are asking for is consistency.\n\"We are going to have to consider zonal marking as it is too damaging for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nShay Given recorded his second own goal in the Premier League, both against Everton (first in October 2007).\nThe Toffees are now unbeaten in five Premier League games at Goodison Park (won three, drew two), having won one of the previous nine.\nRomelu Lukaku failed to score or assist a goal for the 11th Premier League appearance running.\nEverton have won back-to-back Premier League matches for the first time since February - on both occasions the second game was against Stoke.\nMark Hughes' side have secured just two wins in their past 13 Premier League fixtures (W2 D4 L7), picking up only 10 points from a possible 39.\nStoke City have now gone 12 Premier League games without a clean sheet.\nWhat's next?\nThe international break means it will be two weeks before these sides are next in action.

The 29-year-old latched on to it and thumped home his shot via the woodwork.\nIt was the minimum the Foxes deserved having dominated possession, and they increased their lead after half-time when captain Morgan lashed in a fierce volley.\nThe defending champions should have made it 3-0 but Fabianski guessed where Mahrez would place his spot-kick after Okazaki had been fouled in the area by Jordi Amat. The Japanese forward then saw his follow-up saved by the Polish keeper.\nSwansea leave it too late\nFrancesco Guidolin's side had gone AWOL as an attacking force during the first 30 minutes of this game as Leicester harried and pushed them back.\nBar a couple of tame Gylfi Sigurdsson efforts, it appeared it might be a case of how many Leicester would score after Morgan made it 2-0.\nBut then the Swans clicked into gear. Gambian winger Modou Barrow, who was sensational down the right and put in a handful of great deliveries, was justly rewarded for his efforts when Dutch midfielder Fer got on the end of another peach of a cross in the 81st minute.\nFoxes full-back Danny Simpson also had to be on hand to clear another Barrow cross, with striker Fernando Llorente poised in the area.\nSchmeichel worry\nLeicester's number one Kasper Schmeichel had little to do in the game, but his one vital interception resulted in him coming off the pitch.\nThe Danish goalkeeper was at his sharpest as he rushed out to beat Fernando Llorente to the ball, but he appeared to hurt himself in doing so.\nSchmeichel signalled to the bench as the penalty drama played out in the Swansea box, and was soon replaced by summer signing Ron-Robert Zieler.\nAfter the game, Ranieri said Schmeichel had aggravated a hernia, but should not be out for long.\n\"He has a small hernia,\" the manager said. \"He was due for an operation on Monday, but he should be ready for our next match.\"\nSchmeichel will have a two-week recovery period after his surgery, with Leicester's next game on 10 September at Liverpool.\nMOTD analysis\nAlan Shearer: \"I thought it was nonsensical to not have Danny Drinkwater in the squad for the Euros when other players were not fit.\n\"Against Swansea he had more passes, more touches and covered more distance than anyone else - he was just superb.\n\"His weight of pass for Jamie Vardy's goal was absolute perfection - it was just screaming out for someone with pace to go and get on the end of it.\n\"He was brilliant last season and he is full of confidence.\"\nMan of the match - Modou Barrow (Swansea)\nManager reaction\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I am very happy. We played very well in the first half. In the second half we could have closed the match, but missed a penalty and in the end we complicated our life. But it was a good three points and I'm very happy.\n\"These three points are very important for us because we lost the first match - we've now taken four points from two matches at home, which is OK.\n\"The draw against Arsenal was OK and today was a good performance. I am glad.\n\"We have a very good platform. We wanted to keep all our players. It wasn't possible and one went away but it's OK. We are happy and now we start our season.\"\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \"In my opinion Leicester deserved to win because they played very well in the first half and we didn't.\n\"But in the second part of the game I saw my team play better and the result was 50-50 at the end.\n\"Leicester is a strong team like last season, one of the best teams in the Premier League. I am confident because my team is a good team. We can play better.\n\"For us it was not a good match in the first half. But after that we played with more courage and aggression and we had the opportunities to draw. But I am honest and Leicester deserved to win.\n\"In my career I played with these conditions. It's not the first time but today was very difficult to play and stay on the bench. It was not a good day for the weather. We are used to it because in Wales the weather is not very good.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nRanieri has secured his 100th Premier League win as a manager, becoming the fifth non-British/Irish manager to reach this landmark.\nVardy has become the third Leicester player to score 30 Premier League goals, after Muzzy Izzet and Emile Heskey (both 33).\nVardy has now scored six times in his last seven Premier League games for the Foxes.\nSix of Drinkwater's eight Premier League assists have been for Vardy goals.\nMahrez has missed three of his last four penalties in the Premier League.\nFer has scored in two of his three Premier League games this season, having failed to score in any of his 11 games in the last campaign for the Swans.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester are at Anfield after the international break and Swansea are at home to Chelsea on Sunday 11 September."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-0 Burnley\nChelsea continued their perfect start to the season with a comfortable victory over Burnley at Stamford Bridge.\nThe excellent Eden Hazard opened the scoring when he burst forward from halfway early in the first half before finishing low into the corner.\nWillian then added a second just before the break with a clinical strike.\nScott Arfield shot wide for Burnley, but substitute Victor Moses wrapped up the win by sliding home a late finish.\nVictory means Chelsea are currently top of the table, level with Manchester United on nine points from three games, but ahead on goals scored.\nRelive Chelsea win against Burnley\n'Conte has Chelsea focused again'\nHazard back to his best - Shearer\nHazard lights up Stamford Bridge\nTwo seasons ago, Hazard was arguably the best player in the Premier League as his 14 goals and nine assists helped Chelsea to win the title.\nHowever, he was a shadow of his former self last season, failing to score in the Premier League until the end of April.\nUnder Antonio Conte, he appears to have rediscovered his best form. His goal against Burnley - the Belgium international's second in four games - was reminiscent of those he scored in 2014-15, charging at the defence before despatching a perfectly placed strike beyond Tom Heaton's dive.\nThe Clarets had no answer for Hazard, whose clever runs and tricky feet caused the visitors' defence, and in particular full-back Matt Lowton, problems throughout.\nIf Chelsea are to win the title this season, they will need the winger at his best. On his showing so far this season, that appears to be the case.\nHazard is 'enjoying playing' for Chelsea again - Gullit\nWing play wins it for Chelsea\nConte has favoured either a 4-1-4-1 or a 4-2-4 formation since taking over at Chelsea and both require a lot of work from his wingers.\nIn order to be effective, they need to stay wide and both Hazard and Willian were hugely successful at doing this. Such a tactic forced Burnley to stretch their defence, so when either winger cut inside there was space for them to work with. The outcome was a goal apiece for Hazard and Willian.\nWhen the two went off, their replacements - Pedro and Moses - picked up from where they left off, combining for Chelsea's third.\nBurnley's brick wall crumbles\nBurnley produced arguably the result of the season so far by beating Liverpool 2-0 in their previous Premier League game.\nThey had just 19% possession against the Reds but made the most of their limited time on the ball, while their disciplined two banks of four frustrated Jurgen Klopp's side throughout. That was not the case in this game.\nBurnley failed to work the ball quickly to forwards Andre Gray and Sam Vokes, allowing Chelsea to regroup and cut off their attempts to counter. In the end, they never looked like getting anything from the game.\nHowever, they will rarely face tougher tests than this one. They next face Hull City and with Premier League survival their target for this season, getting a result in that game will be a truer test of what they can achieve this season.\nWhat they said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"I am pleased to see the team play well and create a lot of chances. After 13 games where we have conceded at home, we didn't this time and that is very important. Now we must continue.\n\"I want Hazard to be decisive at the beginning and I am pleased because I saw this today. However we must continue with his work and the work of the whole team.\n\"I am pleased to work with these players but if we find a right solution, we want to improve this squad.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"They were far too good today. They are too strong in all areas. We want to take on the challenge and I think the lads got too sucked in with the result from last week.\n\"We did not use the ball at all. There were too many sloppy passes and you just cannot do that against teams like this one.\n\"They were never in trouble, but we have to learn from these games. This is not really our market, there is a big gap from where they are and where we are.\n\"We were not close to getting a result today.\"\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\nThe stats you need to know\nAntonio Conte is now unbeaten in his last 30 home league matches as a manager (W28 D2).\nDiego Costa has had a hand in a goal in each of his last five Premier League appearances (three goals, two assists).\nThe Clarets conceded more goals in this game (3) than they had in their previous four away Premier League games (2).\nThe Blues ended a run of 13 home Premier League games without a clean sheet, with their last before today in a 2-0 win over Norwich in November 2015.\nVictor Moses scored his first Premier League goal for Chelsea since November 2012.\nBurnley's first shot in this game was in the 43rd minute.\nThe Clarets still have not won at Stamford Bridge since April 1971, losing six and drawing two games since then.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Burnley entertain Hull on 10 September, while Chelsea travel to Swansea the following day."

First he headed over after attacking Puncheon's corner with real conviction and then he fired over in the final minutes after bringing the ball down well on the edge of the area.\nFortunately for him Dann, who had been made an auxiliary striker for the final minutes, came to Palace's rescue with a bullet header in the final minute of stoppage time.\nAlan Pardew knows it will take Benteke time to adapt to his new team-mates but with just one point and one goal in their first three games he will need his record signing to start firing after the international break.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer said on MOTD: \"Crystal Palace have to find a way to work out his game and he has to find out what Palace are all about.\n\"Alan Pardew has spent a lot of money on attacking players and he has to get the best out of them. If they don't then Pardew will be under pressure.\"\nPalace pressure eventually tells\nBoth teams came into this game desperate for points having lost their opening two games of the Premier League season.\nIndeed Palace have won just two league games in the whole of 2016, while the Cherries are now winless in their last eight league matches.\nBournemouth had the better of the opening 45 minutes and possibly should have led by more at the break, with Callum Wilson guilty of a poor finish after being played in by goalscorer King.\nHowever, the second half was a totally different case, with Palace piling on the pressure.\nArter cleared a Dann header off the line, Boruc saved magnificently from Lee Chung-yong and Connor Wickham smashed over when well-placed as the Eagles threw everything at the visitors.\nIt looked like Eddie Howe's men were going to hold out but ultimately a quality ball from Puncheon proved to be their undoing.\nWhat they said\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"Justice was my overriding emotion when we equalised because we had an unbelievable amount of pressure in the second half.\n\"If our fans had gone home at half time then I couldn't have blamed them but they stuck with us and kept us going.\n\"I think the signs are there for us with Christian (Benteke). It was a promising debut from him.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"They're such a strong physical team and it's very difficult to stop the direct play.\n\"We ended up sinking very deep to try and protect what we had and that wasn't our wish but psychologically I think it's very hard to reverse that.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nPalace have now failed to win 20 of their 22 games in 2016. (W2 D6 L14).\nYohan Cabaye has missed his last two Premier League penalties, having scored all of his four previous penalties.\nScott Dann has scored more Premier League goals than any other defender since the start of 2015-16 (6).\nArtur Boruc has saved the last three penalties he has faced in the Premier League.\nThe Cherries have won only one of their last 11 Premier League games (D2 L8).\nMan of the match - Artur Boruc\nWhat next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Middlesbrough after the international break while Bournemouth host West Brom."

It has to be absolutely brilliant for him at that football club, working, training and socialising with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney.\"\nRuud Gullit: \"What I like about Rashford is that he goes straight past players.

I hope Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho considers him more because he's a great player.\"\nMan of the match - Curtis Davies (Hull)\nWhat they said:\nHull manager Mike Phelan: \"You are playing quality sides who bring quality off the bench, but I am proud of the players. They have put hard work in today without getting anything out of it.\n\"The Hull players are good players, and good people. They are determined and earned the right to be at this level.

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-1 West Ham\nManchester City continued their 100% start to the season with a victory over West Ham that took them to the top of the Premier League.\nCity scored first when Raheem Sterling finished off a superb team move and Fernandinho headed in a second from Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick.\nWest Ham pulled a goal back in the second half when Michail Antonio nodded in Arthur Masuaku's cross.\nSterling added his second late on when he stroked home from a tight angle.\nRelive City's 3-1 win over West Ham\nThe season may be in its infancy but already the title contenders have put down a few markers with three games gone.\nChelsea and Manchester United both secured victories on Saturday, which turned the focus on Pep Guardiola's side before the international break, and they responded with a determined display.\nA blistering start - underpinned by the attacking triumvirate of Sterling, Sergio Aguero and Nolito - yielded a slick goal finished off by Sterling.\nIt was not just the polished passing and intense pressing which caught the eye. City's second goal ensured four of their nine Premier League goals this season have come from set-pieces.\nThat they could not convert their first-half dominance into more goals will be mildly concerning to Guardiola as they allowed West Ham back into the contest after the break.\nHowever, a steely response to see out the victory when put under pressure, before Sterling calmly passed the ball into the net in injury time, will have pleased the City boss.\nRejuvenated Sterling proving his worth\nLast season Sterling did little to justify the \u00a349m City paid Liverpool for him in July 2015, while Euro 2016 with England proved to be a nadir in a difficult 12 months.\nInevitably it led to questions about whether his burgeoning talent would ever be realised at City, and more pertinently in the short term whether he would feature in Guardiola's immediate plans.\nThe Catalan's ruthless streak - as goalkeeper Joe Hart and midfielder Yaya Toure are finding out - has come to the fore early in his tenure.\nSterling, though, has been rejuvenated by Guardiola and his two goals put the gloss on another impressive display.\nWith three assists so far in this campaign, he has had a hand in five goals in four games.\nBy contrast, he was involved in just four goals in his last 17 appearances under Guardiola's predecessor Manuel Pellegrini.\nIf Sterling's form can be sustained over the course of the 2016-17 season, he will emerge as a key component in City's quest for silverware.\nGritty West Ham lacking cutting edge\nThere was every chance Slaven Bilic's side could have been blown away by City, such was the home side's imperious start, but they stood firm.\nIt was a spirited showing from the visitors, particularly after their disappointing exit from the Europa League on Thursday, and the Etihad crowd shifted uneasily once Antonio pulled a goal back.\nHad the Hammers possessed a more potent goal threat they may well have left Manchester with more to show for their efforts.\nEnner Valencia and Ashley Fletcher showed plenty of willing but the lack of cutting edge emphasised why Bilic has brought in Italy striker Simone Zaza from Juventus on a season-long loan.\nWith only a few days left before the transfer window closes, Bilic may yet feel the desire to strengthen his goalscoring options further.\nWill Aguero be suspended for the Manchester derby?\nThe only sour point for Guardiola will be the prospect of a possible suspension for Aguero for the Manchester derby on 10 September.\nAguero lashed out with an elbow on Winston Reid which caught the West Ham defender in the throat. The incident was missed by referee Andre Marriner while neither manager claimed to have seen it.\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage believes the Argentina forward may be handed a retrospective ban when the Football Association reviews the video evidence.\n\"The replays don't look good. I think he's going to be in trouble,\" Savage said.\n\"Only Aguero knows if he's elbowed Winston Reid. I can't say he's done it on purpose but on the replays it looks like he swung his arm back and caught him in the throat.\"\nMan of the match - David Silva (Manchester City)\nWhat they said:\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"At 2-1, the emotions, not the tactics, went in. We created many chances, I don't know how many shots we had but the performance in general was real good with or without the ball. With the quality of our players, we can be satisfied.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We stayed in the game. I wasn't happy at half-time, I asked the guys to show character and spirit and a different mentality, which they did. Praise for the team for the second half performance.\"\nWhat's next?\nJose Mourinho and Guardiola renew their rivalry in the Manchester derby when City face United at Old Trafford on Saturday, September 10 (12:30 BST). West Ham host Watford at the London Stadium later the same day (15:00 BST).\nThe stats you need to know:\nThis is only the second time in league history that both Manchester clubs have won their first three league games in the same season (also 2011-12).\nNolito has scored three and assisted two more in his first five games for Manchester City in all competitions.\nKevin de Bruyne has provided 15 assists since debuting for Man City, five more than any other player at the club in that time.\nFernandinho scored his first Premier League goal in 365 days - his last came against Watford on 29 August 2015.\nMichail Antonio has scored a league-high eight headed goals in the Premier League since the start of 2015-16.\nSince August 2015, no English midfielder has scored more Premier League goals than Antonio (10) - level with Tottenham's Dele Alli."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-2 Manchester City\nPep Guardiola emerged victorious from his first Premier League battle with old adversary Jose Mourinho as Manchester City secured a fully deserved win in a frantic Old Trafford derby.\nKevin de Bruyne's cool finish and Kelechi Iheanacho's tap-in after the Belgian hit the post put City in complete control as they outclassed Mourinho's Manchester United for most of the opening 45 minutes.\nUnited were handed a lifeline just before the break when City's debutant keeper Claudio Bravo summed up his desperately uncertain display by dropping a free-kick to allow Zlatan Ibrahimovic to pull a goal back.\nThey mounted an aerial siege in front of the Stretford End but City held firm to maintain their position at the top of the table, coming closest to scoring when De Bruyne struck an upright from Leroy Sane's pass.\nRelive City's Manchester derby win\nGuardiola defends Bravo in derby win\nPhil McNulty on how Man City put Man Utd in their place\nGuardiola strikes psychological blow\nThe long-time rivalry - and acrimony - between former Real Madrid manager Mourinho and ex-Barcelona boss Guardiola meant this fixture was ringed on the calendar from the moment it was announced.\nA truce was called in the build-up to the game as Guardiola announced he would accept an invitation for a post-match glass of wine with Mourinho and there was an embrace when they met before kick-off.\nAnd when the game started, Guardiola stalked his technical area, micro-managing every moment of City's approach, while Mourinho crouched and made notes as the game progressed.\nThe Spaniard will have been delighted to see such early superiority, a magnificent first 40 minutes of clinical passing and movement leaving United's midfield, including \u00a389m world record buy Paul Pogba, as virtual passengers.\nIt was only that moment of indecision from Bravo that disrupted City - and Guardiola's congratulations for his players at the end were also an expression of delight for their resilience when the going got tough late on.\nHe showed his willingness to shore things up when he sent on Fernandinho for Iheanacho - but it was not such a good day for Mourinho.\nThe Portuguese gave summer signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan his first start in an unfamiliar right flank role and it was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford after a nightmare first half.\nMourinho also brought on Ander Herrera for Jesse Lingard for the second half but City survived an improved United showing to maintain their flawless start to the season.\nListen: Not a lot of difference with Man Utd this season - Waddle\nBBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast\nBravo the only blot on City's day\nThis was exactly how Pep Guardiola would have wanted it - a crucial victory that keeps Manchester City top of the Premier League table and marks them down already as the team to beat this season.\nAnd in that opening half, City's hierarchy were able to sit back and watch the sort of football they had in mind when their long courting of Guardiola finally came to fruition.\nCity - without suspended striker Sergio Aguero - were simply in a different class to Mourinho's expensively reassembled Manchester United as they overran them in midfield, created space and chances while remaining cool under pressure.\nIt was only when Bravo's ill-judged dash to claim a free-kick and subsequent poor handling cost them a goal that they showed any signs of being unsettled.\nThe 33-year-old keeper was brought to Etihad Stadium in preference to Joe Hart, whose style did not find any favour with Guardiola.\nOne of Bravo's big selling points was supposedly his ability with the ball at his feet - but here he was shaky and indecisive, twice having to launch himself into desperate challenges on Mkhitaryan and Rooney after dawdling in possession.\nBravo is, however, a vastly experienced keeper whom Guardiola rates highly and so should be given time to settle.\nMourinho gets reality check\nJose Mourinho is a perfect fit for Old Trafford but this was never going to be a quick fix after the last three years of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal.\nUnited look more physically imposing with the addition of players like Ibrahimovic, Pogba and defender Eric Bailly - but it is up front where he has the big dilemma.\nIbrahimovic is the main man but how does Mourinho fit in his array of attacking riches around him?\nThe United boss has Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial, while he must also work out how to utilise Juan Mata and Mkhitaryan.\nThis selection looked mix and match - but Mourinho is a manager who specialises in finding successful solutions.\nWhat the managers said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We are happy. I think the spectators enjoyed it because it was open until the end. First half we were better - in the second half it was difficult. We had counter-attacks and we didn't finish.\n\"These guys have a heart - in the first half we won a lot of duels against a team physically stronger. In the second half, the long balls, you just pray because it's almost impossible to control that.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"The two halves were completely different. In the first half we were below the level to play this match. You have to be completely ready in terms of the speed of your thinking and decision-making.\n\"The second half was completely different. We were a team that had the courage and honesty and dignity to chase with pride the result which I think we deserved - we deserved a goal in the second half.\"\nMan of the match\nThe stats you need to know\nJose Mourinho has won just three of his 17 meetings with Pep Guardiola (D6 L8).\nManchester City secured their 50th Manchester derby win in all competitions.\nAgainst Man City, Man Utd posted their fourth lowest home possession figure in the Premier League since 2003-04 (39.9%).\nKevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in 32 goals in 46 appearances in all competitions for Man City (17 goals, 15 assists).\nKelechi Iheanacho has scored nine goals from just 13 shots on target in the Premier League.\nWho's up next?\nBoth teams kick off their European campaigns midweek, with City hosting Borussia Monchengladbach in the Champions League on Tuesday, before United travel to Feyenoord in the Europa League on Thursday."

In the first half we were totally dominant.\n\"There's such small margins between teams at this level. We had to be very patient, but it was a great goal by Callum Wilson.\n\"I'm really pleased for him. Players go through highs and lows. He's had a severe knock with his injury but he always shows enthusiasm and brightness and you could see from his celebration how much this meant to him.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"For over a season Saido has been wrapped up in where he's going and he's playing in the top league in the world. You have to be mentally prepared - you can't just switch it on and off and he needs to understand that.\n\"In the 20 months I've been here he was a talisman for the first six months, but then we've lost him for the last year. It's been difficult.\n\"It's been an interesting club to manage. The way it's run is different, but also dealing with a player that has for two thirds of that period not doing really what he should be has been difficult.\"\nMan of the match\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth visit leaders Manchester City, where they lost 5-1 last season, on 17 September at 15:00 BST. West Brom face West Ham at the Hawthorns at the same time.\nThe stats you need to know\nDespite not scoring in almost one year, Wilson is still the Cherries' second highest goalscorer in the Premier League, with six (Joshua King has seven)\nBournemouth kept their first clean sheet in seven home league meetings with West Brom\nThe Baggies have scored only seven goals in their past 14 Premier League games\nSince Tony Pulis took charge, West Brom have failed to score in 21 Premier League matches - the joint-highest number among current clubs in the division (level with Crystal Palace)\nBournemouth claimed their first home victory in the league since beating Swansea 3-2 in March"

His only effort at goal after the break was blocked and he was taken off after 63 mostly ineffective minutes.\nWenger threw on Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and, eventually, Alex Iwobu too, but his side continued to struggle in front of goal until Fonte tangled with France striker Giroud and referee Robert Madley pointed to the spot.\nSaints unlucky to leave empty-handed\nSouthampton are in the bottom three after failing to win any of their first four games of the season, but they were unfortunate not to pick up at least a point in north London.\nShane Long was left on the bench until half-time but had three good chances in the second half.\nLong wasted his best chance when he fired well wide after Tadic's superb flick had left him with only Cech to beat.\nThe Republic of Ireland striker also headed over the bar when unmarked from a free-kick and did not get enough on his follow-up shot after Cech had parried a Pierre Hojberg strike.\nMan of the match - Arsenal's Santi Cazorla\nWhat next?\nArsenal begin their Champions League campaign on Tuesday (19:45 BST kick-off), with a trip to play French champions Paris St-Germain, before another away game, at Hull, in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 BST).\nSouthampton are also on European duty, at home to Sparta Prague in the Europa League on Thursday (20:05 BST), before they host Swansea on Sunday (14:15 BST).\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal scored with both of their shots on target in this match, from 17 shots in total.\nArsenal are unbeaten in their past 22 home league games against Southampton (W16 D6).\nThe Gunners have already won more Premier League penalties in 2016-17 (three) than they did in the whole of 2015-16 (two).\nKoscielny became the fifth Arsenal player to score a Premier League goal on their birthday (after Paul Merson, Robert Pires, Yossi Benayoun and Cazorla).\nSaints scored their first Premier League goal at the Emirates since a 1-6 defeat in September 2012.\nCech scored his second Premier League own goal, and first since December 2009 (for Chelsea against Everton).\nCazorla's past seven Premier League goals for Arsenal have been penalties."

West Ham were all over the place. Watford were superb in coming back though.\nWest Ham to review stadium security\nWest Ham have pledged a \"full review\" of security at the London Stadium after fighting broke out during the match.\nTrouble flared between rival supporters and the club later released a statement\n, external\nciting \"zero tolerance\" on fan violence. It said offenders would be \"banned for life from any West Ham fixture\".\nThe stats you need to know\nToday was the first time Watford have won a Premier League game having been 2+ goals behind (L37 before today).\nWest Ham have lost two of their last four home Premier League matches after going 15 without defeat beforehand.\nWatford have scored four goals in a PL away game for the first time.\nMichail Antonio has scored a league-high 10 headed goals since the start of last season.\nSince their return to the Premier League, Odion Ighalo (16) and Troy Deeney (14) have scored almost two-thirds (64%) of Watford's 47 Premier League goals.\nEtienne Capoue has scored three goals in four appearances this season after netting just one in his previous 57 in the Premier League.\nWhat the managers said\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"It was a shock to be 2-2 at half-time but there were still 45 minutes to go.\n\"We let them score two goals in the second half without putting them under pressure. It was too easy for them.\n\"We can not defend like that or we are not going to win a single game.\nWatford boss Walter Mazzarri said: \"We didn't start very well but we started to concentrate better and the result came.\n\"We changed a couple of things in our formation at half-time and that allowed us to not risk as much.\n\"It was a great win but I look at the way we played and we have to correct the mistakes we made.\n\"This win gives us the confidence to know we are a very good team and can go on to have a very good season.\"\nMan of the match - Roberto Pereyra\nWhat next?\nWest Ham visit West Brom on Saturday while Watford host Jose Mourinho's Manchester United on Sunday lunchtime."

It was the kind of towering header typical of his best seasons in the Premier League with Aston Villa between 2012 and 2015.\nAfter Adam Clayton's misplaced pass, Palace took a throw-in on the right flank, from where Zaha delivered a diagonal cross towards the Belgian at the back post.\nHe easily shrugged off his marker, hung in the air and planted a header beyond Victor Valdes, a spectator in the Boro goal.\nLater, Benteke was replaced by his 21-year-old brother Jonathan - who joined Palace's development squad on 1 September but was a substitute on Teesside, while Mathieu Flamini also came on for his Palace debut.\nBoro's off-day at the back\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka will be very disappointed with his side's defensive performance.\nTheir promotion-winning campaign last season was built on solidity at the back, especially at home, but the second goal they conceded immediately after the break ultimately handed the match to Palace.\nIt looked a relatively simple intervention but Boro's usually impressive left-back Friend dallied when dealing with McArthur's pass and allowed Zaha to steal in for a simple finish on his left foot.\nThe home side recovered well and would have drawn level again had it not been for some excellent defending, but their spirited second-half comeback came to nought.\nMiddlesbrough 1-2 Crystal Palace\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\nWhat they said\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"We have lost when we were in a good position. When you lose a game through mistakes it is difficult, but we have to think about the future and learn. We have to keep going.\n\"All of us have learned we can't drop our intensity in the Premier League, we have to play always in the same style. We had a lot of chances in the second half and if we had played the first half the same way we would have won the game.\n\"The club has done an amazing job building this squad, I am really pleased with them. We can't drive ourselves crazy because we are in a good position.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew:\n\"The first 20 minutes were important for us that we built on the Bournemouth performance and we were terrific in that period, we deserved the lead.\n\"You can't control a whole Premier League game and we had to really hold on towards the end. If we do that for 38 games we'll go OK.\n\"We have some big players back at the ranch and hopefully we can get them fit.\n\"I thought Wilf (Zaha) was terrific and he deserved the assist and the goal. He showed qualities offensively and defensively.\"\nWhat's next?\nMiddlesbrough next play away to Everton in a 15:00 BST kick-off on Saturday. Palace play again next Sunday when they host Stoke at 14:15.\nThe stats you need to know\nMiddlesbrough suffered their first defeat in their last 14 league games (W7 D6).\nCrystal Palace finally secured an away league win in 2016 at the 12th attempt.\nChristian Benteke is the first Belgian to score for three different Premier League clubs (Aston Villa, Liverpool and Crystal Palace).\nWilfried Zaha scored for the first time in his last 24 Premier League appearances, last scoring in November 2015 v Newcastle.\nDaniel Ayala netted his first Premier League goal in his 15th appearance in the top flight (5 games for Liverpool, 7 for Norwich and 3 for Middlesbrough).\nAll four of Boro's goals this season have come in the first half."

It didn't make a difference.\"\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen (Spurs)\nPost-match reaction\nStoke manager Mark Hughes:\n\"That second half wasn't the level we needed to be at to get to get back into the game. The first half we started brightly and showed intent but the goal knocked us back. We got caught on the break and they were good goals.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino:\n\"I think that after four games unbeaten you can see that the players are thinking about the new season, the new challenge.\n\"We forget the past. We worked hard to forget last season and focus on the present. After four games we are unbeaten and you can see that the team has recovered.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane:\n\"It is not an easy place to come but to win 4-0 here last year and today made it look easier than it is. I don't think we started that well but then we punished them when we needed to.\"\nTottenham forward Son Heung-min:\n\"It is unbelievable to win at Stoke away. We had a great game and deserved to win. Both of my goals gave me pleasure because it is my first game of the season.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham turn their attentions to the Champions League. Spurs return to Europe's premier club competition for the first time since 2010-11 when they host Ligue 1 side Monaco at Wembley.\nStoke have a full week off before travelling to Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Sunday (14:15 BST).\nStats of the day\nTottenham have won 4-0 in more than one Premier League away game against the same opponent for the first time.\nTottenham have won more games at Stoke (six) than any other Premier League side.\nTottenham have scored 17 Premier League goals at Stoke, more than any other visiting side.\nOnly Arsenal's Mesut Ozil (19) has provided more Premier League assists than Spurs' Christian Eriksen (15) since the start of last season.\nStoke have won just one of their last seven Premier League matches at home, drawing two and losing four.\nStoke keeper Shay Given has now conceded 603 Premier League goals - only Jussi Jaaskelainen (613), Mark Schwarzer (653) and David James (665) have conceded more."

Some 8,500 seats were added to the Main Stand this summer.\nMan of the match - Roberto Firmino\nManager reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \"It was a tough game against a really strong opponent.\n\"This team is really capable of a lot of exciting things. We played quick but then we conceded and had to show we could fight and stay in the game.\n\"I don't think about where we can reach. We have to be really strong in this league. We have had four away games to begin with, so let's go for it, enjoy it and today I saw some really wonderful things.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"Liverpool played well and deserved to win. We started well, but after the first goal we lost our shape a little.\n\"We tried in the second half, but everything Liverpool tried came good. We created chances, but were a little unlucky.\n\"We have to clear our minds for the next match. When we have lost in the past, we have always had a good reaction.\"\nMatch stats\nLiverpool have won more games against reigning Premier League champions than any other side has (20).\nThis is the 14th time that a reigning Premier League champion has conceded four or more goals in a single match.\nLiverpool have scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than any other team (50).\nMane has scored eight goals in his past eight Premier League appearances.\nVardy has found the net three times in his past two Premier League games against Liverpool. He has scored seven in his past eight league games.\nSince the start of last season, Firmino has netted more Premier League goals than any other Liverpool player (12).\nWhat's next?\nLeicester play their first ever Champions League match on Wednesday, when they go to Club Brugge in their Group G opener (19:45 BST kick-off). They host Burnley in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00).\nLiverpool do not have any European football this season, with their next match coming at Chelsea on Friday in the league (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 2-2 Chelsea\nChelsea dropped their first points of the Premier League season as Diego Costa struck twice to rescue a draw in a feisty encounter at Swansea City.\nCosta, who might earlier have been sent off, capitalised on poor defending to fire the dominant visitors in front.\nBut Gylfi Sigurdsson's penalty and Leroy Fer's bundled goal two minutes later turned the game on its head.\nCosta scored an acrobatic late second to salvage a point for Antonio Conte's team, who stay second in the table.\nAnalysis: 'Chelsea right to feel robbed by referee'\nItalian Conte was aiming to become the fourth Chelsea manager to win his first four Premier League games in charge, joining Jose Mourinho, Guus Hiddink and Carlo Ancelotti.\nThe visitors enjoyed total control for almost an hour before imploding with the concession of two goals in three second-half minutes. The second came after defender Gary Cahill lost the ball after he was dispossessed by Fer near the edge of his own box - with the England international saying afterwards he thought he had been fouled.\nBut Costa's brace at least protects the Italian's unbeaten record, with Chelsea - who ended the game with their captain John Terry appearing to be injured - now two points behind leaders Manchester City.\nRelive the action from the Liberty Stadium\nHartson: Costa should have gone\nConfrontational Costa\nHaving limped to 10th place last season, Chelsea had started this campaign with a swagger befitting genuine title contenders.\nCosta had embodied that turnaround with two goals in his first three league games, and he was at his snarling best at the Liberty Stadium.\nThe Spain striker clashed with Swansea's defenders on several occasions and was booked for a clumsy challenge on Federico Fernandez, whose mistake Costa ruthlessly punished for the opening goal.\nThe Argentine defender hesitantly headed the ball to Oscar, whose pass allowed Costa to score with a clinical low finish.\nCosta could have been dismissed against West Ham on the opening weekend before going on to net the winner - and he lived on the edge again against the Swans.\nIt was a small wonder he and Jordi Amat both stayed on the pitch having bickered throughout the game, and Costa was perhaps fortunate to escape a second yellow card for what appeared to be a dive under pressure from Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski in the second half.\nBut as he usually does, Costa relished the confrontation and he proved Chelsea's saviour as he equalised with a bicycle kick after 81 minutes.\nSwansea's controversial revival\nHaving lost their previous two fixtures, the Swans were staring at the prospect of suffering three successive defeats under Francesco Guidolin for the first time.\nIn what appeared to be an attempt at damage limitation, the Italian switched to a defensive 5-4-1 formation with a compact midfield diamond aimed at containing Chelsea.\nThose efforts were in vain as the Swans were initially overrun and outclassed by their rampant opponents.\nGuidolin abandoned his new system after just 41 minutes, with Wales left-back Neil Taylor dismayed as he was sacrificed for winger Modou Barrow.\nThe bold move paid dividends as Swansea staged a remarkable second-half revival.\nThey were awarded a penalty when Sigurdsson was tripped by a stranded Thibaout Courtois, who was the beneficiary of a rule change which means players are only booked rather than sent off if they are deemed to have only accidentally denied their opponent a goalscoring opportunity.\nSigurdsson confidently converted the spot-kick, and the fans had barely had time to catch their breath before the next controversy.\nFer appeared to foul Cahill as he dispossessed the Chelsea defender, and Swansea's Netherlands midfielder ran clear before squeezing his shot past Courtois and over the line.\nMan of the match - Diego Costa\n'It's a big mistake' - what the managers said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"It's very difficult to talk about the game because we lost two points. We were leading 1-0 and created a lot of chances to score another goal. We are disappointed because the performance was very good in terms of our intensity and because we played good football.\n\"People looking at the second goal can see that the referee made a mistake - but this can happen. I've not spoken to the referee. It's a big mistake.\"\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \"I am happy with the result. My team played the second half with more energy against a very strong team.\n\"After Chelsea's first goal I saw my team not playing well and decided to change something before the end of the first half. I am sorry for Neil Taylor [getting substituted] but I decided this way because we needed a reaction.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nOnly five players have reached 35 goals in the Premier League in fewer appearances than Costa (58) - Andy Cole (41), Alan Shearer (42), Fernando Torres (52), Kevin Phillips (52) & Ruud van Nistelrooy (55).\nCosta's opening goal was also the 100th scored in the 2016-17 Premier League season.\nThere were just two minutes and 10 seconds between Swansea equalising and scoring their second goal.\nSigurdsson has now scored more Premier League goals for Swansea than any other player (26).\nEleven of the 13 outfield players to play in this match for Chelsea attempted at least one shot.\nWhat next?\nChelsea's burgeoning title credentials will be tested by their next two games, at home to Liverpool and away against Arsenal.\nSwansea, meanwhile, face a daunting sequence of fixtures - a trip to Southampton followed by home matches against Manchester City and Liverpool and then a visit to Arsenal."

It's tough putting together a relatively new team - but we never really got a full grip on the game.\"\nMoyes has reinforcements in the shape of new signings Mika, Jason Denayer and Didier Ndong - all of whom started Monday's game on the bench - but they will have to hit the ground running if the club are to avoid another relegation battle this season.\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\nThe stats you need to know...\nEverton have lost just one of their last 18 Premier League matches played on a Monday (W8 D9 L1).\nThis is the sixth consecutive Premier League season that Sunderland have failed to win any of their opening four games in that campaign.\nSunderland haven't won any of their last 23 Premier League matches contested in either August or September (W0 D9 L14).\nRonald Koeman is the first Everton manager since Thomas McIntosh in 1919 to win his first two competitive away games in charge of the club.\nThis is only the second time in Premier League history that Everton have won as many as 10 points in their opening four games of a season - the other was in 2006-07 when they finished sixth.\nWhat next?\nSunderland face a tough trip to Tottenham on Sunday (16:30 BST), while Everton are at home against Middlesbrough a day earlier (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool\nLiverpool continued to gather impressive momentum in the Premier League as they inflicted Antonio Conte's first loss as Chelsea manager with a deserved victory at Stamford Bridge to move into the top four.\nReds boss Jurgen Klopp was a winner at Stamford Bridge last season - and this was three points Liverpool fully merited to add to a triumph at Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season and a draw at Tottenham.\nLiverpool were keen to build on the 4-1 thrashing of champions Leicester City at Anfield last weekend and they over-ran Chelsea to take control by half-time through Dejan Lovren's close range finish and captain Jordan Henderson's spectacular 25-yard strike.\nChelsea, with \u00a332m defender David Luiz making his first appearance since returning to Chelsea from Paris St-Germain as replacement for the injured John Terry, pulled one back through Diego Costa but their laboured performance deserved nothing from this game.\nKlopp wins battle of the 'A-listers' - but how far can Liverpool go?\nRelive Liverpool's win at Chelsea\nKlopp's Liverpool taking shape\nKlopp's Liverpool is looking more like the sort of team their manager wants with every passing week as they produced another impressive performance.\nLiverpool may yet remain on the margins of the title race but victories such as this, added to the excellent 4-3 win at Arsenal and a fine display in the 1-1 draw at Tottenham, will certainly see those at Anfield exuding quiet confidence.\nKlopp was without influential forward Roberto Firmino here, ruled out with a groin problem, a severe blow as the Brazilian's work-rate, tactical awareness and goal threat has made him a vital component in Liverpool's success against the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United since the German's arrival.\nIt made little difference as Liverpool's prodigious work ethic, a staple of Klopp's style, pressured Chelsea into submission and gave them a constant goal threat as well as a defensive shield.\nTwo of Liverpool's big summer buys made an impact, with Sadio Mane giving them real pace and menace and Georginio Wijnaldum offering a steadying presence in midfield.\nMeanwhile, the reliable James Milner illustrated once again why Klopp was not prepared to answer demands to rush into the market and buy a left-back.\nLiverpool are still a work in progress and will still have questions to answer when they produce performances such as that which saw them lose at Burnley earlier this season - but once again they showed at Stamford Bridge that the charismatic Klopp is taking them in the right direction.\nChelsea still rely on Terry\nChelsea's decision to agree a new one-year contract with captain Terry may have been belated, after a spell when it looked like his Stamford Bridge career was coming to a close.\nOn this evidence, however, it looks a very wise move because the 35-year-old centre-back still has a key role to play as Chelsea make their latest managerial transition into the Conte era.\nChelsea, without Terry, lacked direction and leadership in defence on Friday, even though they were able to re-introduce the returning Luiz as Terry sat this one out through injury.\nThe ex-England captain is not only still a formidable defender but he is the consummate organiser and would surely have lessened the chances of the shambolic marking that left Lovren in splendid isolation to turn in Liverpool's opening goal.\nConte's reality check\nConte's animated touchline body language screamed out frustration as Chelsea struggled to exert any sustained pressure on Liverpool and were far too ponderous for long periods.\nHe made a good start at Chelsea after leaving his job as Italy coach, albeit needing late winners from Costa against West Ham United and Watford before a convincing win against Burnley.\nThe size of his task was hinted at by the way they lost control of a game they were winning before drawing at Swansea City, and here they were second best throughout.\nAs stated before, they miss Terry and experienced figures such as Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic are starting to look frayed around the edges.\nCosta cannot dig them out of trouble every time and there was even a question mark over Conte's approach, taking 83 minutes to make a change when it was clear something needed to be done.\nWhen it came, it was a triple substitution as Victor Moses, Pedro and Cesc Fabregas came on for Willian, Oscar and Matic, although there was widespread surprise that \u00a333m striker Michy Batshuayi was not given an opportunity.\nConte, perhaps understandably, is learning the ways of the Premier League. And there is plenty for him to learn at Chelsea.\nPost-match reaction\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte:\n\"We conceded the goals in a strange way. They took the free-kick quickly for the first goal and it was a great shot from a long distance for the second but if we are in the right position he must not receive the ball unmarked.\n\"When you want to think like a great team you must pay attention in every moment.\n\"We played with good intensity and anger in the second half. We scored a goal and could have scored another with Diego Costa. We played a good second half.\n\"I must work more to improve my players. Defeats are never good. We know this, we must work and keep our concentration.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"It was a satisfying win of course. From the first second we had unbelievably good movement. We were quick in mind. We did really well. We deserved the lead at half-time.\n\"We have to learn how to manage the game plan. So often this season Chelsea scored in the last few seconds with a direct style. But I can't remember too many chances from them. We had a few moments where we weren't so good but that's normal against a good team.\n\"We played football like hell. It was really nice to watch. In the second half it was a bit more difficult. After their goal, we managed it well.\"\nLiverpool goalscorer Dejan Lovren:\n\"It is always a tough game here but I thought we did brilliantly. In the first half, I thought it was our best football of the season.\n\"It's always good to score but the most important thing is the three points. The spirit is perfect so we just need to keep working.\"\nMan of the match - Dejan Lovren (Liverpool)\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in action on Tuesday, when they play in EFL Cup third-round ties.\nChelsea go to Premier League champions Leicester, while Liverpool visit Championship side Derby County.\nStats of the day\nLiverpool have won five of their last nine Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge, having won only one of their first 16 trips there.\nAntonio Conte lost his first home league game as a manager since January 2013, ending a run of 30 games without defeat.\nSince Jurgen Klopp took charge of his first game, Liverpool have scored 15 Premier League goals from outside the box, five more than any other side in that time.\nDiego Costa has been involved in at least one goal in every game he's played so far in the Premier League this season (five goals, one assist).\nOnly Sergio Aguero (21) has had a hand in more Premier League goals in 2016 than Costa (18, 12 goals and six assists).\nDejan Lovren ended a run of 64 games without a Premier League goal, last netting for Southampton against Sunderland in January 2014.\nChelsea have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last seven home Premier League games against Liverpool, last doing so in October 2009.\nThe Blues were two goals behind in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2015 v Leicester, Jose Mourinho's final match in charge.\nNemanja Matic has assisted in each of his last two Premier League games at Stamford Bridge - as many as he had managed in his previous 38 home appearances before this run.\nLiverpool are without a clean sheet in nine away Premier League games, their longest run since May 2005.\nJurgen Klopp is the first manager to win his opening two visits to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League since Arsene Wenger, and only the fourth manager overall to do so along with Mike Walker and Harry Redknapp."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 3-0 Burnley\nLeicester City's record signing Islam Slimani marked his Premier League debut with two goals as the champions outclassed Burnley.\nThe striker opened the scoring in the last minute of the first half with a header from Christian Fuchs' free-kick.\nHe made it two just after the restart with another header and Ben Mee's own goal completed the scoring.\nThe win capped off a great week for the Foxes, who also won 3-0 at Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nRelive Leicester's 3-0 win over Burnley\nSuperb Slimani\nSlimani, who arrived for a reported \u00a329m from Sporting Lisbon last month, had a Premier League debut to remember.\nThe 28-year-old Algerian should have opened his account when he somehow failed to connect with a deep cross from Marc Albrighton before he got off the mark for his new club.\nMatt Lowton needlessly fouled Albrighton on the left-hand edge of the area in the last minute of the first half and Slimani powerfully headed home Fuchs' free-kick.\nHe was celebrating his second goal in the 48th minute with another header after Jamie Vardy flicked on Riyad Mahrez's low cross after the Clarets gave away the ball in their own half.\nHis goals were not the only thing that stood out on Saturday, though, as he linked up well with fellow Algerian Mahrez and strike partner Vardy.\nManager Claudio Ranieri, whose team had picked up only four points from their first four league matches before Saturday, will also have been pleased with the industry his new striker showed when closing down the Burnley defence.\n'Four minutes of madness' cost Clarets\nIt was a hard afternoon for Sean Dyche's side.\nThey could have got the day's first goal when Steven Defour headed straight at Ron-Robert Zieler after Scott Arfield headed George Boyd's cross across goal to him.\nHowever, they never recovered from conceding the first goal and were probably fortunate to only lose by a three-goal margin.\nDyche started with a five-man midfield but this left Andre Gray isolated. Once the Foxes scored their second goal, the Burnley striker was a mere spectator as the hosts showed why they were last season's champions.\nThe Clarets could do little to stop Mahrez and he claimed the assist for the third goal when Mee put though his own goal from his low cross.\nBurnley substitute Johann Berg Gudmundsson's deflected free-kick forced a good save from Zieler in the dying minutes and Dyche will have at least been pleased with how his side continued to compete with the game over as a contest.\n\"The reality was four minutes of madness - two before half-time and two after,\" Dyche said.\nWhat the managers said\nLeicester City boss Claudio Ranieri: \"I am very happy with the result and the performance of the players. I was curious to see how my players reacted after the Champions League and they reacted very well.\n\"After the victory in the Champions League, it was very important to continue in the Premier League.\n\"We scored three goals and Islam Slimani scored twice. I think our fans are very happy. It's important Slimani continues to score because if he only scores in the first match we have a problem. He is a good lad and very happy.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"We gave away a really poor free-kick and they score. You go into half-time and try and change things and calm things down. Then we give away another poor goal.\n\"You are in trouble after that because we're playing against a very good team. We have to keep learning and keep moving forward.\"\nMan of the match - Islam Slimani (Leicester City)\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Ranieri's former side Chelsea in the third round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday, while Burnley are back in action with a home game against Watford a week on Monday.\nStats of the day\nIslam Slimani has scored nine headed goals in league competition in 2016 - seven for Sporting Lisbon in the Portuguese Liga and two for Leicester City in the Premier League.\nSlimani's league goal tally in 2016 stands at 22 goals in 23 league appearances.\nLeicester City are unbeaten in 10 successive league games against Burnley (W7 D3 L0).\nBurnley have failed to score in six of their last eight Premier League games away from home.\nThe Clarets attempted two shots on target in this match. They have attempted just four in their last three Premier League games overall, while they have allowed their opponents 19 shots on target in those three matches."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 4-0 Bournemouth\nA scintillating Manchester City made it eight wins out of eight in all competitions this season as they easily beat Bournemouth at Etihad Stadium.\nKevin de Bruyne put the league leaders in front with a low free-kick under the wall after a Jack Wilshere foul.\nCity were dominant and two clinical counter-attacks led to Kelechi Iheanacho and Raheem Sterling tap-ins.\nIlkay Gundogan calmly slotted in a fourth but City had Nolito sent off late on for an attempted head-butt.\nThe Spaniard was involved in a clash with Adam Smith and, while any contact with his head looked slight, referee Jon Moss had little option but to dismiss the winger.\nRelive Manchester City's win over Bournemouth\nFollow action and reaction to Saturday's games\nDeadly De Bruyne\nCity's passing and movement was a joy to watch and the influential De Bruyne was at the heart of their play.\nThe Belgian midfielder, who scored in the win over against Manchester United last week, played behind main striker Iheanacho and caused Bournemouth all sorts of problems as he was involved in all his side's goals before going off to a standing ovation.\nDe Bruyne's absence for two months last season was a huge setback for City as they dropped from second to fourth in the Premier League, and from three points behind leaders Leicester to 15.\nThe 25-year-old's intelligence, running with the ball and vision made him a constant threat and his link-up play with Sterling, Nolito and Iheanacho left Bournemouth bemused.\n\"The performance from Kevin was terrific, amazing,\" said City boss Pep Guardiola. \"He is on another level. He is a fantastic player and helps us a lot.\"\nThe rebirth of Sterling\nSterling did score a hat-trick against the Cherries at the Etihad last season but, for most of the campaign, was a subdued presence following his \u00a349m move from Liverpool.\nHowever, the 21-year-old appears to be back to his livewire best as he closely pushed De Bruyne in the man of the match stakes.\nThe dribbling skills and pace that make him such a threat were impressively on show against Bournemouth and he has clearly benefited from the arrival of Guardiola.\nThe City boss phoned Sterling during the summer\n, external\nbefore officially taking over to tell the winger he was a big part of his plans, and the Spaniard looks to have restored his confidence.\nApart from his goal, and his assist for Iheanacho, Sterling also went close when he dispossessed Charlie Daniels on the right flank, producing a mesmerising run across the Cherries box - past a host of defenders - before seeing his shot hit the post.\nOverall, Sterling has now had a hand in eight goals in his seven appearances for Manchester City this season, scoring three and assisting five.\nHow did Wilshere do?\nLike his team, Wilshere looked out of his depth on a chastening afternoon for both as he made his first start of the season following his loan move from Arsenal.\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe replaced striker Callum Wilson, who scored the winner against West Brom last week, with the England man to reinforce his midfield, but the move did not pay off.\nWilshere clumsily shoved Nolito off the ball to concede the free-kick from which City scored their opener and the 24-year-old struggled to have an impact on the game.\nThe visitors were also guilty of giving the ball away too cheaply and, although Josh King's pace did cause City some moments of concern, they rarely had the ball long enough to use that as a weapon.\nBournemouth, who saw Wilson's shot hit the crossbar, had 35.7% possession in the match.\n\"It was difficult for Jack in the first half, because he's at his best when he has the ball, and we didn't have too much of it,\" said Howe.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nWhat they said:\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"Our high pressing was not perfect today - we had problems with controlling the Bournemouth build-up, but we created a lot of counter-attacks.\nOn the sending off of Nolito: \"The referee took a decision and we have to accept that.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was a tough day. Manchester City were excellent. The nature of the first two goals against us was disappointing.\n\"They're a very impressive team. When you play against the best, your learning is accelerated. That said, we had some opportunities but didn't make the most of them. We weren't at our very best, but you have to give them credit.\"\n'City like Barca'\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Jermaine Jenas: \"The way Guardiola has Manchester City playing at the moment is astonishing. It's like watching Barca at the Nou Camp.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City have won their first eight games of the season in all competitions, the first top-flight team to achieve this since Chelsea, whose run extended to nine games, in 2005-06.\nKelechi Iheanacho has scored 10 Premier League goals from just 14 shots on target in the competition.\nIlkay Gundogan is the first player to score on his Manchester City Premier League debut since Javi Garcia in September 2012.\nBournemouth have kept just one clean sheet in their past 14 Premier League games.\nJack Wilshere has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of his past 18 Premier League games, last playing a full game in the top flight on 13 September 2014 against Manchester City.\nWhat next?\nManchester City play at Swansea twice in a row with an EFL Cup game on Wednesday, 21 September and a league game three days later. Bournemouth host Preston in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, 20 September before a home game in the league against Everton on Saturday, 24 September."

I felt embarrassed at half-time. We were three down and we can say that some of the goals were individual mistakes.\n\"The penalty is hard to explain as the opponent is nowhere near our player. But we can't make so many mistakes when we don't have the ball. The problem is big - we can't say we were just unlucky.\n\"It happens so many times at the start of the season - it is simply too many times.\n\"There were some positive things in the second half, but we want action not reaction. We have a problem, starting with me. I know that we have a problem and I am the manager and I have to do everything to turn this around, solve that problem.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"It was a good performance. But we played well at Bournemouth last week and probably created as many opportunities. The difference is we've won the game and that changes people's perceptions.\n\"We're pleased the ball has gone in the back of the net but we've done nothing different - other than the ball has gone in the back of the net.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChadli's penalty was the first he has taken in the Premier League, despite this being his 90th appearance in the competition.\nRondon has scored in four of his last seven Premier League appearances for West Brom.\nChadli scored two and assisted two more in this match, the first time a West Brom player has had a hand in four goals in a single Premier League game.\nAntonio has scored more headed goals on his own (five) than any team in the Premier League this season.\nThe Hammers have conceded at least two goals in 12 of their last 15 Premier League matches (33 goals conceded overall).\nWhat next?\nWest Ham are in midweek action in the EFL Cup, entertaining League two Accrington Stanley, followed by the visit of Sunderland in the Premier League on Sunday, 25 September.\nWest Brom face a trip to Stoke in the league on Saturday."

These were not particularly classy strikes from the Chilean, but he got the job done.\nWenger, in a season when the pressure is on him to deliver silverware, will likely feel there is plenty to build on from this performance.\nEssential Hull hold on to Phelan\nMike Phelan's side might have been comfortably outclassed by Arsenal here, but the scoreline perhaps flattered the visitors.\nWhatever the delay is over caretaker manager Phelan's future at the KCOM Stadium, Hull's owners should get it sorted immediately.\nPhelan has been offered the job permanently but there is speculation he could yet walk away over a dispute about wages.\n, external\nDespite being down to 10 men his side chased every lost cause, scrapped for every 50-50 ball and never threw in the towel.\nGiven the manner in which he has galvanised a side largely in disarray when he took over in July he will be worth every penny to the club.\nIwobi emerging as an influential player\nHis spindly legs and slim frame make him look like he could be blown over at any moment, but Iwobi showed he can be a key player for Arsenal this season.\nThe 20-year-old occupied pockets of space, used the ball intelligently and had a hand in a couple of Arsenal's goals.\nSanchez will get the attention for his goals, but against a physical Hull side Iwobi showed he has the fight and determination to go with his flair.\nThere has been speculation this week\n, external\nthat Arsenal will keep Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain waiting on a new contract.\nOxlade-Chamberlain might find that he will be playing second fiddle to Iwobi if the youngster produces this kind of performance regularly.\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"I feel overall it was a positive performance after playing away in the Champions League and away again today.\n\"We started well, dominated and were fluent. They defended well but overall we managed to score the goal, then after the missed penalty we had to be serious and score the next goal.\"\nHull caretaker boss Mike Phelan:\n\"My future is a lot brighter - 48 hours ago I was offered some terms. Due to this game being up on us, I decided to leave it alone for now.\n\"Hopefully I'll take this club on - I want to be involved and take a great group of players forward.

The team is more aggressive but they need to run more and press more.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"Everton had to play their best to beat us. We started really well but we were a little bit lost in the last 10-15 minutes of the first half.\n\"I can be happy with the attitude of the team because other teams would have lost five, six or 7-1. We were battling to the end.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nEverton have won four of their first five league games for the first time since 1978-79, when they finished fourth in the First Division.\nMiddlesbrough failed to direct a single shot on target in the game but still scored - only the 10th time that has happened in the Premier League since the statistic began being recorded in 2003-04.\nGareth Barry has scored two goals in his last four Premier League games, as many as in his 95 before that.\nRomelu Lukaku has now scored against 21 different teams in the Premier League.\nLukaku has netted four goals in his last two games for Everton in all competitions after failing to find the back of the net in the previous 13.\nWhat next?\nEverton host Norwich in the EFL Cup on Tuesday and will then hope to extend their unbeaten run in the Premier League when they visit Bournemouth next Saturday.\nMiddlesbrough entertain Tottenham at the Riverside on Saturday before Aitor Karanka's outfit travel to the London Stadium for the first time to face West Ham."

We were afraid then we made the changes and everything went the right way - it is something we need to work on.\n\"I don't look too much at results but how we play. We have been improving dramatically.\"\nAnd what about a drink with Mourinho after the game? \"If he has time we will do it. We spoke before the game - even one day next week we can go out for dinner.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho:\n\"I reflect on three factors from the match, but only one of them I can improve.\n\"The first factor depends on ourselves, it relates to our individual mistakes and collective mistakes as individual players and as a team. We have to improve something, it is in our hands.\n\"At 1-1 everyone thinks we are going to win the game. We were showing complete control, intensity, creation.\n\"But their second goal is a mistake that goes against our plan and our training, because our intention was for their wing-backs to be pressed and not let them progress.\n\"And what happened was the guy gets the ball 20-25 metres away from our box and instead of being pressed, we give him the space to progress. Nordin Amrabat receives the ball and our left-back Luke Shaw is 25 metres from him instead of five.\n\"The second factor is the referee and I can't control their mistakes.\n\"The third factor is luck, we didn't have it. We were the best team when we lost.\"\nRashford's scoring record and other stats you need to know\nRashford (10) has scored more goals in all competitions for Manchester United than any other player since his debut in February.\nCapoue has scored four goals from just five shots on target in the Premier League this season.\nZuniga's goal was the fastest by a substitute since Liverpool striker Divock Origi's (37 seconds) against Aston Villa in February.\nSince his debut in August 2014, Daryl Janmaat has provided more assists in the Premier League than any other defender (11).\nManchester United scored their 800th Premier League away goal; 96 more than any other team."

We have a strong squad.\"\nSwansea form a worry for Guidolin\nSwansea were clearly hoping to frustrate their hosts and catch them on the counter-attack or with a set-piece but Francesco Guidolin's side lacked the quality to do either.\nSuch was their lack of threat, Southampton comfortably kept their first clean sheet in 17 games, their last one having also come against Swansea in February.\nVisiting forward Fernando Llorente was provided with little service and when he did get a touch to a Modou Barrow cross Jose Fonte was on hand to block his effort.\nThe next noteworthy chance for the visitors fell to Sigurdsson after 86 minutes - and he would have snatched an undeserved draw had Forster not smartly saved before Oriol Romeu cleared the loose ball to prevent Jefferson Montero turning it in.\nSwansea are now winless in the league since their opening day victory over Burnley and their next three league games are against Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal.\nMan of the match - Dusan Tadic\nWhat they said:\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"It was a difficult game. I say congratulations to my players - they kept a good spirit and a good attitude. We found the solution to score.\n\"It is important for the future. We have to play every few days, many games, and it is hard physically. It is important for the squad to play games and improve and make progress.\"\nSwansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \"Southampton deserved to win. For us it was not a good performance. We have to change our attitude - we have to play well and be more aggressive, and this is reason why Southampton won today.\n\"Now is not a good moment. To know why, I have to speak with players, my assistants - it is our job.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nCharlie Austin's goal was his first in the Premier League since he scored on his Southampton debut against Manchester United in January.\nClaude Puel earned his first Premier League win, becoming the seventh Frenchman to achieve this feat (Alain Perrin, Arsene Wenger, Gerard Houllier, Jacques Santini, Jean Tigana and Remi Garde the others).\nSwansea have not scored a first-half goal this season, firing five blanks so far.\nWhat next?\nSwansea face two home games against in-form Manchester City, with an EFL Cup game on Wednesday, 21 September before a league match three days later. Southampton are at home to Crystal Palace in the EFL Cup on Wednesday before a league trip to West Ham on Sunday, 25 September."

We're too open and teams capitalise on that. We are not giving ourselves a chance to win Premier League games.\n\"It's key we stay in games - at the moment we are just chasing games too much.\n\"This is not the start we expected, it's a case of getting together and what we are doing, the game plan needs to be at a better level. The dressing room is full of good talent, but that talent needs to ally it to sensible play, which we're not doing.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nFor the first time since December 2015, Crystal Palace recorded successive Premier League victories.\nThe Potters have picked up just one point from their opening five league games - their worst start in nine Premier League seasons since promotion in 2008.\nSince the start of last season, Crystal Palace (12) have scored more Premier League goals via defenders than any other side.\nStoke have only netted eight goals in their last 11 Premier League games, scoring more than once on just one occasion.\nScott Dann has scored seven league goals since the start of the 2015-16 season, two more than any other Palace player and two more than any other Premier League defender.\nStoke have conceded four goals in six of their last 11 Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nPalace face a trip to Southampton in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, while Stoke also have Premier League opposition in the Cup, hosting Hull.\nThe Eagles are back on the road on Saturday with a visit to Sunderland and Stoke will be looking for a first three points against West Brom at the Britannia on the same day."

Having been cautioned for dissent, he saw red after fouling Ben Davies.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\nWhat they said\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"Steven Pienaar had a great chance and we probably need to score any chance we get.\n\"Jordan Pickford is going to be a very good keeper. He has a lot of work to do at the moment, more than I'd like him to get. He will get better, he has a real good future ahead of him.\n\"We had a chance to clear the ball for the goal. That was a mistake and, of all the chances Tottenham got, that was a soft one and we gifted them that.\n\"It is a big job. I know how much is going to get better. All we can do is keep getting on the training field and making it better and I enjoy doing that.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"Sometimes it's difficult. In the end it was fair.\n\"We fought a lot and tried to score. I'm happy with the three points and it takes away the feeling from losing against Monaco.\n\"I want to create chances and play well - sometimes you need a lot of chances to score. Today we always tried to go forward. We feel disappointed because we created a lot of chances in the first half.\"\nStats you need to know\nThe Black Cats are without a clean sheet at White Hart Lane in any of their last 21 league visits there since a goalless draw in September 1980.\nKane has scored in three of his four home Premier League appearances against Sunderland.\nThe England striker has also scored in back-to-back Premier League games after having gone five games without a goal.\nSunderland have not won any of their last 24 Premier League matches contested in either August or September (drawn nine, lost 15).\nSpurs are unbeaten in their opening five Premier League games for only the second time (also 2004-05).\nThis is the fourth consecutive season that Sunderland have failed to win any of their opening five Premier League games.\nSpurs had 19 shots in the first half, the most of any Premier League side since Liverpool's 20 against Leicester in December 2015.\nWhat next?\nTottenham host League One side Gillingham in the EFL Cup on Wednesday before travelling to Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Saturday.\nSunderland are at Championship side QPR in the EFL Cup on Wednesday before entertaining Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 4-1 Leicester City\nManchester United thrashed Premier League champions Leicester City as boss Jose Mourinho dropped captain Wayne Rooney from his starting line-up.\nChris Smalling's header put United ahead before Juan Mata finished off a slick move with a crisp strike.\nMarcus Rashford and Paul Pogba - with his first goal for the club - both scored from corners, with Demarai Gray's spectacular long-range strike the only consolation for Leicester.\nRooney came on in the 83rd minute.\nUnited's first Premier League win in a month was sealed by half-time, but a third defeat for Leicester already matches their total for the whole of last season.\nListen: Football Daily Podcast\nNo Rooney, no problem\n\"If he has to go on the bench, he goes on the bench. If he has to stay at home, he stays at home.\"\nMourinho was true to his pre-match words as Rooney was dropped for a Premier League game for the first time since Boxing Day 2015 - and ended up a spectator for what was eventually a transformed first-half performance.\nFor the first 20 minutes it may have been more of the same from United - ponderous and slow in their approach - but once Smalling headed in Daley Blind's corner the shackles were released.\nHow much of a difference Rooney's absence made to their play is hard to quantify, but a 4-0 lead at the break was proof enough the change was justified.\nMata, nominally playing in Rooney's place behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic, was bright and lively and took his goal superbly before teeing up Rashford for a tap-in, but it was in midfield the hosts were able to really take a grip of the game as Leicester froze.\nRooney eventually came on with seven minutes left, replacing Rashford on the left wing. Where his future role now lies remains a mystery but Mourinho's decision to leave out his captain could hardly have worked out better.\nA glimpse of Pogba's best\nUnited's first-half performance was their best of the season so far, and went hand-in-hand with Pogba's finest display since his world-record move to Old Trafford this summer.\nMourinho chose Ander Herrera to partner him instead of Marouane Fellaini or Michael Carrick, and Pogba played noticeably further forward, often interchanging with Mata.\nHe had already played two searching cross-field passes before a flurry of individual highlights as United scored three goals in five dazzling minutes at the end of the first half.\nPogba delivered a disguised chip over the top to Ibrahimovic, who volleyed over, fired in a dipping 35-yarder that was well saved by Ron-Robert Zieler, and sliced through a pass that freed Antonio Valencia. The Frenchman then played a key part in Mata's second before he headed his first goal for the club.\nFor \u00a389m he is expected to control games, and he did for a brilliant spell.\nHe was anonymous after the break but the game was already won.\nFoxes need to fix their defence\nLeicester's shock title win last season was built on the back of the attacking brilliance of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, coupled with the work ethic of the now departed N'Golo Kante, but also on a solid defence, which conceded just 36 goals in 38 games.\nThe Foxes won five of six games 1-0 in March and April to move towards the championship as they conceded four goals in seven games.\nYet here they became the first defending Premier League champions to concede four goals in a single half.\nWhat will hurt manager Claudio Ranieri even more is that, apart from Mata's brilliantly constructed and taken second goal, the other three were simple goals from corners which could, and should, have been stopped.\nThe Foxes collapsed after the opening goal and the message was clear at half-time when star men Vardy and Mahrez were taken off, apparently rested for the Champions League date with Porto in midweek.\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\nAnalysis\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone at Old Trafford\nThere is no great disconnect between Wayne Rooney and club or manager, as there was in 2013, when Rooney sat in an executive box and watched Sir Alex Ferguson's final Old Trafford game as Manchester United manager behind glass.\nRooney politely applauded back when he was sent out to warm up for the first time, and the home fans' reception was enthusiastic when he ran on to the field after replacing Rashford near the end.\nIt won't stop the chatter around Rooney though. His United future is on the line.\nMourinho's decision is not about this lunchtime - or Thursday, when United face Zorya Luhansk in the Europa League and Rooney is likely to start.\nIt is about next month, and January and June next year. About the day when Henrikh Mkhitaryan is going to be fit and in form. When transfer windows open and close.\nRooney did not get dropped for the man Mourinho bought to be his new number 10. He got dropped because Mourinho needed to do something to wake his team from their September slumber.\nWhat we don't know yet is whether England's captain is surplus to requirements permanently.\nWhat they said\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho:\n\"Today we had intensity, movement and dynamism. To be back home and beat the champions is good. Last season we couldn't beat them and this season we have beaten them twice already.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri:\n\"It is not possible to concede three goals from corners. That means you are not concentrating. We are usually very solid at corners and free-kicks, it was very strange. Until now we have been very strong, we have made some mistakes. I can understand that they score with headers, that they are very tall, but to score a smart goal from a corner is not possible.\n\"It is important to clean our mind and get ready for the Champions League on Tuesday.\"\nWhat next?\nLeicester host Porto in their first home game in the Champions League on Tuesday, while Manchester United welcome Ukrainian side FC Zorya Luhansk to Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday."

It was a brilliant, amazing first half in all aspects.\n\"It was a world-class performance in counter pressing. We didn't give Hull the opportunity to create confidence. It was wonderful to watch. All in all, really good.\n\"I was a little angry we conceded. It would be nice to have a clean sheet one time in the season.\n\"Maybe we will work on this. It was a professional second half from the players. I am not interested in statements now just collecting points.\"\nHull caretaker boss Mike Phelan, speaking about taking over permanently as manager: \"Everything is open to debate. I am doing my job like I've always done.\n\"We have to look forward to what's ahead but we've had two disappointing results. We have Chelsea to come and then we go into 'our league' and we'll be judged on that.\n\"The offer has been there but it hasn't been signed, sealed and delivered yet. We had a terrific chat and I'm waiting now. I want it to be sorted out. It'll be done when it's done.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nPhilippe Coutinho has now scored eight goals from outside the box in the Premier League since the start of 2015; two more than any other player.\nHull City have had red cards in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since January 2014, with their two most recent coming courtesy of handballs in the box.\nMilner has scored in 43 Premier League games without losing (W35 D8); only Darius Vassell (46 games) has scored in more without defeat in Premier League history.\nSadio Mane has had a hand in six goals in six games for the Reds this season in all competitions (three goals, three assists).\nOnly one manager (Colin Todd - Bolton 0-5 Man Utd in December 2001) has lost a Premier League game by a bigger margin on their birthday than Mike Phelan did today.\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are at Swansea for a 12:30 BST kick-off in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 October, while Hull host Chelsea on the same day at 15:00."

        "article_text": "Middlesbrough 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nSon Heung-min scored two superb goals as Tottenham moved up to second in the Premier League with victory at Middlesbrough.\nOn a windy day at the Riverside Stadium, Spurs took the lead when Son feinted to shoot twice in the area before striking a low 10-yard effort.\nThe South Korean made it 2-0 when he wriggled out of a tight position and curled in from edge of the area.\nBoro improved after the break and pulled a goal back through Ben Gibson.\nTottenham's win means they have made their best start in the top flight for 51 years.\nRelive the action from the Riverside Stadium\nReaction from Saturday's other Premier League games\nListen: Football Daily Podcast\nSon shows leadership qualities\nSince joining Spurs at the start of last season, Son has often been the foil to Harry Kane's role as lead striker.\nThe 24-year-old's industry and unselfish play around the attacking areas has complemented the more predatory Kane, who has grabbed the goals, headlines and adulation.\nWith Kane injured, though, Son showed himself a more than able understudy.\nBoth of his goals were wonderful. The first saw him play a one-two with Vincent Janssen, fool both Adam Clayton and Calum Chambers, then shoot past Victor Valdes.\nHis second was better.\nThere looked to be little threat to the Boro goal as Son reached the byeline on the right of the area. However, the forward then wriggled out of his tight position, before turning and firing a fantastic low curling shot into the far corner.\nTottenham's Achilles?\nSpurs fans will not want to be reminded of their side letting leads slip.\nIn the last four games of the 2015-16 campaign, it happened on three occasions - two resulted in draws and one in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton. Not only did their title hopes evaporate but they also failed to hold on to second spot.\nOn Saturday, they dominated a flaky Boro side during the first half. But after the break, Mauricio Pochettino's side appeared to ease off the pressure, allowing the home side back in.\nHad Boro been more potent in attack, it might yet again have been a case of 'one that got away'.\nTraore spirit lifts Boro\nBoro boss Aitor Karanka will have been buoyed by the turnaround in the second half. The only thing missing was the player to link midfield and attack.\nThere was little penetration in the attacking third, until Adama Traore was brought on in the 59th minute.\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder displayed bravado that had been missing when he twice ran through the heart of the Spurs midfield, but with no end product. If he gets that part of his game right, he could be crucial in Boro's aim to stay in the Premier League.\nThe home side's goal came from a familiar source when Stewart Downing delivered a free-kick from the left that Gibson nodded down past the diving Hugo Lloris.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min (Tottenham)\nManager reaction\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"It's frustrating for me to work for seven days to try to show them how Tottenham play and how good they are if we let them play, then we go on the pitch and seven minutes later we are losing 1-0.\n\"These mistakes were made last week and the week before, but the worst and most frustrating thing for me was the attitude, especially in the first half because in the second half we were completely different.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"We fully deserved the result - the most important thing is the victory. Son was fantastic but it was a collective effort.\n\"The first half was great and we should have scored more than two. We need to learn to be more aggressive and clinical.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSon has had a hand in seven goals (six goals, one assist) in his past six Premier League appearances for Spurs.\nSon has already equalled his Premier League goal tally from last season (four) in just three games, via two doubles this season.\nTottenham have won 23 of their past 25 Premier League games against newly promoted sides since losing 1-0 to QPR in April 2012.\nBoro have failed to win any of their opening three home Premier League fixtures of a season for the first time since 2000-01.\nBy contrast, Spurs have remained unbeaten in their opening six Premier League games of a season for the first time since 2004-05.\nWhat's next?\nSpurs are at CSKA Moscow on Tuesday in the Champions League (19:45 BST) before returning to Premier League action next Sunday at home to leaders Manchester City (14:15), while Boro are at West Ham on Saturday (15:00)."

We got one and we have to take it.\n\"I was encouraged by the performance and we asked questions of them. It's another point on the board. We didn't do too much wrong. I can't complain about our play, they put everything into it.\n\"Points are like gold dust, so we've got something for our efforts.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"That was a deserved point. We conceded a scrappy goal but the reaction of the players was absolutely first class. In the last 20 minutes we really pressed and we got the point we deserved.\n\"I'm pleased because if we had lost I'd have been disappointed. We haven't got the array of talent like they have but the work-rate they put in was fantastic.\n\"We've got a fit group who never give up. We had to respond from going a goal down. I was so pleased with the attitude.\"\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom play the bottom-of-the-table side for the second week in a row when they visit Sunderland on Saturday, 1 October at 15:00 BST.

It is the first time we have been 1-1 at half-time and we spoke of how we had to be like a team and in the second half we played really well.\n\"Sergio is quality. His first step, second step in the box is so good and that is why he is one of the best strikers in the world but I want to help him improve his game.\"\nOn De Bruyne, Guardiola added: \"I think he is injured, that's why we have to have a big squad as everyone will help us.\n\"It's a pity - he is important for us. How he reacted, it looks like it was a muscular injury, but I'm not a doctor.\"\nSwansea City manager Francesco Guidolin said: \"We played a very good game and for one hour we were at the same level as Manchester City and they are the best team in the UK.\n\"In front of us we have a good future. I know my job and after four, five or six defeats it it not easy but I am confident as we have played a good game today.\"\nOn the penalty decision that saw his side fall 2-1 behind, Guidolin added: \"I'm not a judge. If the referee says this I have to accept it. For me it is not a penalty but that's not important, the important thing is my team played a good game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester City are the only side to have scored the first goal in every one of their six Premier League games this season.\nFernando Llorente scored his first Premier League goal for Swansea City in his sixth appearance in the competition for them.\nThis was only Llorente's second goal in 17 league appearances in 2016 (11 appearances for Sevilla and six appearance for Swansea).\nRaheem Sterling has scored four goals and assisted five more in eight competitive appearances for Manchester City this season.\nPep Guardiola has won his first six games as a Premier League manager, equalling the record set by Carlo Ancelotti in 2009-10.\nManchester City have won their first 10 games in all competitions this season - the only previous top-flight side to have more from the start of a season are Tottenham Hotspur (first 11 games in all comps) in 1960-61.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea take on Liverpool at home on Saturday, 1 October in the Premier League (12:30 BST).

The other two were against Aston Villa (1-0) in December 2013, and against Sheffield Wednesday (1-0) in May 1998.\nWhat the managers said\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"We couldn't defend well enough. We went 2-0 up, though perhaps not justly. But we didn't tighten up.\n\"We didn't give ourselves a chance. We have to take responsibility throughout the side - why did we not stop Benteke's run? He got a jump on us and it's beyond me.\n\"This can't always be led by a manager - players have to take responsibility on the pitch. We needed to stand up and assume responsibility, but we weren't capable of doing that.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"This game takes away from you a lot, but it does give it back to you.\n\"Last year I thought we deserved to win here but we didn't.\n\"Today we were excellent throughout the game, disappointing to be 2-0 down but we wouldn't give in and, in the end, scored three excellent goals. We played some terrific stuff, and though Joe Ledley made an error, his finish to score was typical of the man - he has spirit and character.\n\"Benteke is always a threat, and he had a couple of chances. With his goal, it was a great delivery and a clinical finish. We are confident at the moment and we produced.\"\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace visit Everton on Friday (20:00 BST) looking to record their fourth successive league win, while Sunderland will hope to end their search for a first league win of the season against West Brom the following day (15:00)."

Now can they build on the platform laid by this brilliant 90 minutes?\nChelsea look broken\nChelsea looked an old and jaded side when faced with Liverpool's intense, aggressive approach at Stamford Bridge last week, their first loss under Antonio Conte.\nThis was, arguably, an even more harrowing experience and a stark illustration of the job the Italian must do to revive Chelsea.\nConte will know the pressures that come with managing under demanding owner Roman Abramovich, but the man who impressed so much in charge of Juventus and Italy must be given time to address so many problems.\nChelsea still rely so heavily on 35-year-old captain John Terry, out injured here, while elements of the side that looked so strong winning the title the season before last are crumbling.\nBranislav Ivanovic had a miserable game but it was even worse for England defender Cahill, who was responsible for Sanchez's opener and also involved in an arm-waving spat with Courtois after a breakdown in communication in the second half\nKante does not have the energy and support he had in midfield at Leicester City, with Nemanja Matic laboured and Cesc Fabregas off the pace and substituted. The hero of last season's title win was left trailing in Ozil's wake for Arsenal's third.\nEden Hazard has regressed again while Diego Costa's only serious contribution was to conduct another war against the world.\nIn other words, Conte has a large job on his hands.\nSanchez and Ozil the key for Arsenal\nWhen Sanchez and Ozil are in this mood, Arsenal are a threat to anyone. The pair are world class when at the peak of their powers - and they certainly were here.\nSanchez hurried Cahill into a panic before a gloriously composed chip for Arsenal's first, and he and Ozil combined to leave Chelsea's defence embarrassed as the latter scored the third.\nArsenal were outstanding in all areas - but Sanchez and Ozil provided the final flourishes with the sort of class that makes them central figures in all Wenger is trying to achieve this season.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\nThe stats you need to know\nArsene Wenger inflicted Antonio Conte's heaviest league defeat since October 2010, when he was manager of Siena (3-0 loss to Empoli).\nChelsea found themselves three goals down at half-time in a Premier League game for the first time since May 2012 (v Liverpool, 4-1 FT).\nThis was the first time since October 2012 v Manchester United the Blues had conceded twice in the opening 15 minutes of a Premier League game.\nThis is Arsene Wenger's first win over Chelsea in the league since October 2011 (drew three, lost six).\nChelsea's first shot on target came in the 82nd minute.\nHector Bellerin has provided more assists than any other Premier League defender since the start of last season (six).\nTheo Walcott scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since May 2013 (three in a row for the Gunners).\nWhat they said?\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger said: \"It was an outstanding team performance. We played with spirit and collective pace and movement, always in a positive and committed team way.\n\"Our defenders have done extremely well. You cannot say one player was not at the right level from Petr Cech to Alexis Sanchez.\n\"We wanted to start strong in a high pace and committed way. We started wobbly in the first 20 minutes against Southampton. We wanted to be consistent in our pressure no matter the score. We did it very well in the first half. It was in and out in the second, which was understandable.\n\"Ideally you want the perfect game and you never get it. We got nearly the perfect first half and that is not bad. Football doesn't care for history and the anniversaries, just the result on the day. Today we had a good performance.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte said: \"I think that we didn't have the right attitude from the first minute.\n\"After today we are thinking we must work a lot because we are a great team only on paper. It is always a team problem rather than individuals, When nothing works it is very hard for a player to play well.\n\"I don't want to talk about the mistake [from Gary Cahill]. It is not right for the player. We win and lose as a team. If someone thinks this team is ready to fight, I think we must wait to improve a lot to come back a great team on the pitch, not just on paper.\n\"We have not got the balance and now is the moment to consider everything. It is incredible to concede three goals. We must have last season present in our mind to not repeat the mistakes. We must reflect a lot to find very soon the right way.\"\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are involved in Champions League action on Wednesday with a home tie against Swiss side Basel (19:45 BST). Chelsea are not playing again until Saturday, when they visit Hull in the Premier League (15:00)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 0-3 Southampton\nCharlie Austin scored his fifth goal in four appearances as Southampton condemned West Ham to a fourth successive Premier League defeat.\nAustin broke the deadlock in a cagey encounter with a side-foot finish following Ryan Bertrand's pull-back.\nDusan Tadic made it 2-0, collecting a pass from Austin and rounding Adrian before finding the empty net.\nJames Ward-Prowse's low finish consigned West Ham, who had just one shot on target, to defeat.\nThe facts are damning for the Hammers. They have lost five of their opening six games in a top-flight season for the first time in their history and are 18th in the table having conceded 16 goals.\nSouthampton, meanwhile, have won four matches in a row in all competitions and are up to eighth.\nRelive Southampton's win against West Ham\nAnalysis: Why full-backs were key for super Saints\n'Abject West Ham are in disarray' - Chris Sutton's verdict\nAustin leads the way\nHaving selected a midfield comprising Oriol Romeu, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Steven Davis, Southampton's primary aim was to contain while looking to utilise the pace and skill of Nathan Redmond and Tadic on the counter-attack.\nSuch a tactic is dependent on the presence of an efficient striker capable of capitalising on relatively few chances, and in Austin the Saints have just that.\nThe 27-year-old's strike - a well-taken first-time shot from inside the box that found the bottom corner - was the first shot on goal by either team and continued his superb recent form.\nSince making his Premier League debut in August 2014, Austin has scored 21 goals - the same number as Wayne Rooney, despite playing 20 games fewer than the Manchester United and England forward.\nAustin turned provider for the second goal, flicking the ball into the path of Tadic, who made up for wasting two earlier chances by skipping past the onrushing Adrian to wrap up the points.\nSubstitute Ward-Prowse added gloss to the display with a neat finish following Davis' driving run and cutback.\nAt the other end, Southampton had an equally effective protagonist in Virgil van Dijk, who made 16 clearances, including one on the line to prevent Simone Zaza giving the home side hope.\nAnother Hammer blow\nThe result and performance was far from the launch pad West Ham need in what has been a difficult season both on and off the pitch.\nWhile defeats at Chelsea and Manchester City are perhaps unfair barometers by which to judge the Hammers, this loss following successive 4-2 defeats by Watford and West Brom marks a hugely disappointing run for a team who last season pushed for a top-four finish.\nThe situation has not been helped by the in-fighting between home fans during the Watford game, which contributed to an uneasy settling-in process at the London Stadium, which again was largely devoid of atmosphere.\nThis was another dire performance characterised by indecision and nervousness as opposed to the adventurous and fluent attacking displays that saw them score 65 league goals last season.\nPoor at both ends of the pitch, the Hammers have conceded two or more goals in 13 of the past 16 league matches, dating back to March last year.\nThey were no better in the middle, where Dimitri Payet, who excelled for both club and country last season and at Euro 2016, cut a very frustrated figure. He was not alone.\nMan of the match - Virgil van Dijk (Southampton)\nWhat they said\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"They deserved to win. We didn't.\n\"We started well if we are talking about being behind the ball and closing the opponent down. We were not defending well as a team and in the first half we were better, compact and everything.\n\"But we were not happy with how we played in the last third of the pitch. We didn't penetrate enough and were unlucky in the first half.\n\"The second half you are trying to get back into the game and we made a big mistake. We had the ball three times and should have cleared. We tried to put them under pressure but they were always very quick in the moment of transition.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"It was very important to win this game. Against a team without confidence it was important to press.\n\"We had a bad first half because we didn't keep the ball. I find a very good second half for my players with many chances and beautiful goals, which is important for confidence.\n\"For the future this was very good, to see the improvement from the first half to the second.\"\nWest Ham captain Mark Noble told Sky Sports: \"I thought we started all right and then 'bang' we conceded a goal and to be honest we never looked back in it. If I'm honest it could have been six in the end.\n\"Adrian pulled off some good saves and on the bright side, I don't think it can get any worse.\n\"Eleven goals [conceded] in three games is laughable and it's not good enough. I think we could have kept playing until tonight and we wouldn't have scored.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Ham have conceded 16 goals in their opening six games of a top-flight season for the first time since 1967-68 (18).\nThe Hammers have lost back-to-back home league games by a margin of two or more goals for the first time since September 2010.\nOnly Tottenham (three) have kept more clean sheets than Southampton (two) in the Premier League this season.\nWhat next?\nWest Ham host Middlesbrough in a 15:00 BST kick-off on Saturday, 1 October.\nSouthampton's next game is in the Europa League on Thursday, when they host Hapoel Beer Sheva (18:00), before returning to league action on Sunday at Leicester (14:15)."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-1 Crystal Palace\nEverton missed the chance to move second in the Premier League as Christian Benteke earned Crystal Palace a deserved point at Goodison Park.\nThe hosts led when Romelu Lukaku curled a 20-yard free-kick over the Palace wall and into the top-right corner.\nPalace improved after the break, levelling when Benteke met Joel Ward's cross with a towering far-post header.\nThe visitors almost claimed a fourth straight win but Damien Delaney's header was ruled out for offside.\nThe point was enough to move the Toffees up to third place, four points behind leaders Manchester City, though the rest of the weekend's top-flight fixtures are still to be played.\nThe Eagles, who continued their recent revival after taking just one point from their opening three matches, remain seventh.\nAll the reaction from Goodison Park\n'Soft' decision denies Palace victory\nAhead of kick-off Palace might have settled for a point against an Everton side that has made an impressive start under Ronald Koeman, but they perhaps left Goodison Park aggrieved not to take all three.\nThere was some debate over the free-kick from which Everton scored, awarded after Delaney - making his 600th career appearance - raised his boot as he tried to clear a loose ball.\nThe ball hit Everton captain Phil Jagielka's raised arms but referee Jonathan Moss penalised the Palace defender, awarding a free-kick that Lukaku converted with a sublime strike.\n\"It was a harsh decision. Jags put his head down a little bit,\" Delaney said afterwards.\nPalace also questioned why Delaney's second-half header from Ward's clipped pass was ruled out for offside.\nDelaney was in an onside position when the cross came in but television replays showed team-mate James McArthur had strayed offside and was perhaps blocking Maarten Stekelenburg's view when the defender headed the ball into the net.\nBut there was still confusion after the match. Delaney said he been told by the officials that McArthur had been penalised, while Eagles manager Alan Pardew claimed assistant referee Simon Bennett told him Delaney was offside.\n\"I gather the TV replays show Damien wasn't offside,\" said Pardew. \"If that's what the assistant referee's call was then we can feel a bit hard done by on that one.\"\nBattle of the Belgians\nEverton and Palace rely on burly Belgians to spearhead their attacks, so it was no surprise to see both Lukaku and Benteke on the scoresheet.\nThe pair are battling for Belgium's number nine shirt and there was little to choose between them at Goodison Park.\nWhile Koeman has told Lukaku that he must press opposing defences more, his finishing is clinical - and he again demonstrated his ability by bending in his fifth goal in three Premier League matches.\nBut former Liverpool striker Benteke was not to be outdone.\nThe \u00a327m summer signing has provided a much-needed physical presence up front for Palace, and used his aerial ability to pull his side level.\nHe showed intelligence to peel off Jagielka and move to the far post, where he rose above Seamus Coleman to direct a wonderful header into the opposite corner.\nMan of the match - Christian Benteke\nPost-match reaction\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman:\n\"It's a good point in the end. We defended set plays and second balls well against a difficult team.\n\"The team performance was outstanding, although we'd like to create more opportunities.\n\"We've had a good start to the season. The position in the table is not everything at the moment and we need to improve, but we're doing a good job.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew:\n\"I thought we played very well and showed our quality and resilience by coming back from behind again.\n\"Everton had a couple of spells early on where you could see their quality. They took the lead but we wouldn't lie down. We bossed the second half.\n\"I'm happy with the performance of the team and the point.\"\nStats of the day\nCrystal Palace are now unbeaten in their last four Premier League visits to Goodison Park, winning two and drawing two.\nLukaku has scored in four of his last five Premier League appearances against Palace.\nLukaku now has five goals in his last three Premier League appearances - this after a run of 11 consecutive appearances in the competition without a goal.\nSince Benteke's Premier League debut in September 2012, only Olivier Giroud (also 19) has scored as many headed goals.\nBenteke has scored five Premier League goals against Everton, only netting more against Sunderland (seven).\nCrystal Palace have now gone 12 successive Premier League games without keeping a clean sheet.\nThis was Ronald Koeman's 100th competitive game in charge of an English club - winning 49, drawing 19 and losing 32.\nThere were nine yellow cards shown by referee Jon Moss - the most in a Premier League match this season.\nWhat's next?\nA two-week break from the Premier League. Everton resume after the internationals with a trip to leaders Manchester City on Saturday, 15 October (15:00 BST), while Palace host London rivals West Ham later that day (17:30 BST)."

Our relationship is good. There is no problem between me and my players.\n\"I don't know [about the future]. It's not my decision. It's just for me to prepare for the game and the team. I know the situation. It's a possibility. The important thing is to prepare with patience.\n\"Before the game I saw the new owners Jason [Levien] and Steve [Kaplan] just to say 'hello'. I don't know if in the next day there's meeting.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"I thought we could have done better in the first half. Our body language was not good, we were static and it was easy to defend against us. We are not as good as we should have been.\n\"You have to show why we are here. We showed a reaction, were more organised, clear in all situations and we deserved to win. Of course I am happy we have had two or three brilliant games in a row.\n\"If Milner is our top scorer at end of the season with penalties, I have no problem with it. All is good. The performance was not perfect but it was good enough.\"\nStats of the day\nSwansea led in this game for 46 minutes longer than in their six previous top-flight games this season combined (27 minutes).\nLiverpool failed to have a single first-half shot on target for the first time in the Premier League this season.\nThe Swans have conceded twice or more in four consecutive Premier League home games for only the second time, following a four-game run in September 2013.\nJames Milner has scored four penalties in the Premier League this season, more than any team.\nLiverpool have now gone 10 away games without a clean sheet in the Premier League - their longest since a 12-game run in 1998.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Swansea face another tough game in the Premier League when they head to Arsenal on Saturday, 15 October (15:00 BST).

However, the visitors scored from two of them and hit the woodwork another three times.\nWatford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes should have kept out Wilson's close-range header, while King could not believe his luck as he was allowed to run unchallenged with the ball at his feet before finding the net from distance.\nWhile Wilshere was unfortunate to see a curling effort come off a post shortly after Deeney had made it 1-1, he was at fault for missing a golden opportunity to win the game when the score was 2-2.\nThe England international was immediately substituted after shooting against a post when it looked easier to score.\nWatford had another let-off in the dying stages as Stanislas bent a free-kick around the wall only for the ball to strike the bar.\nWilshere again fails to finish\nWilshere started his third match since joining Bournemouth on loan from Arsenal for the rest of the season.\nHowever, he has now gone 20 Premier League appearances without playing the full 90 minutes after being replaced by Dan Gosling 16 minutes from the end.\nThe last time the 24-year-old made it to the final whistle after starting a game was on 13 September 2014 against Manchester City.\nWilshere produced a busy performance as the Cherries secured only their second away point of the campaign.\nHowever, he remains without a league goal since May 2015 after one bad miss in a game Eddie Howe, who has been linked with the England manager's job, felt his side should have won.\nMan of the match - Nordin Amrabat (Watford)\nWhat they said\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri, who was celebrating his 55th birthday: \"The players have given me a nice present today. If they had have been slightly more concentrated they would have given me three points but I am happy now.\n\"One point today, given the intensity, I am happy with it but I am very happy with the performance.\n\"Isaac Success was excellent, playing in the past not just today. He can improve a lot mainly in the defensive parts but he has a lot of potential.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We are disappointed, especially taking the lead twice you think it should be enough. It was end to end and very even but we had the best chances in the game.\n\"On another day we take one or two of the missed chances and win the game. We scored two goals away from home and hit the woodwork three times, it has to be a positive thing.\n\"No one was settling for a point. We were disappointed with the goals that we conceded, especially the second one. It is a tough place to come but our expectations are growing and we want to push to greater heights.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford have conceded in each of their last nine Premier League home games, the longest current run in the competition.\nBournemouth scored more than once in a top-flight game for the first time in 12 games.\nTroy Deeney is now Watford's joint top-scorer in Premier League history with 16, level Odion Ighalo.\nJoshua King is now Bournemouth's leading scorer in Premier League history with eight goals.\nWhat's next?\nWatford are not back in action until 16 October when they travel to Teesside to face Middlesbrough (13:30 BST), while Bournemouth entertain Hull City in their next game on 15 October (15:00 BST)."

Despite right-back Sam Byram going off injured early on, they looked more secure, apart from a lapse of concentration for the goal.\nThey let Boro have 60% of possession, which affected their attacking play, but in Payet they have a constant threat, and the Frenchman's first league goal of the season rescued them.\n\"It's been terrible the last four, five weeks,\" said centre-back James Collins. \"We knew we needed to stop conceding goals. It's a step in the right direction.\n\"We can't depend on Dimi. We need to be better defensively and going forward as it is a lot to ask Dimi to keep coming up with goals like this.\"\nBilic added: \"I don't see many players scoring these type of goals. You see free-kicks, you see volleys, scissor kicks, all different types of goals, but this was like Lionel Messi's goals.\"\nCapital gains for Boro\nThe draw gave Boro their first point from their past six Premier League games in London and, while they had a high work ethic and more of the ball, they lacked a creative spark.\nJordan Rhodes, making his first top-flight start, was a willing runner and caused some moments of concern for the West Ham defence, but Boro rarely looked like scoring from open play.\nThey did have three shots on target to West Ham's two, but their ambition seemed affected by recent results.\nTheir goal came from a set-piece - referee Neil Swarbrick alerted by the goal decision system after Stuani's effort was cleared by Noble.\nMan of the match - Dimitri Payet\nWhat they said\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"I feel pressure because I am not happy with our position in the table and because we lost four matches on the trot.

We have to show it more often.\"\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"It is a good point, especially after three defeats. It is important that our attitude has been good.\n\"West Ham have not been in the best moment but they have amazing players. So I'm pleased to add one more point and play with that intensity.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is West Ham's worst start to a top-flight campaign after seven games (four points) since 1988-89, when the Hammers were relegated.\nMiddlesbrough have lost a league-high seven points from leading positions in the Premier League this season.\nCristhian Stuani has scored three goals in three Premier League away games this season.\nMiddlesbrough have won just one of their past 17 Premier League away games (D3 L13).\nWhat next?\nBoth teams return to Premier League action following the international break, with West Ham facing a trip to London rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday, 15 October at 17:30 BST, and Middlesbrough hosting Watford at 13:30 BST the following day."

        "article_text": "Hull City 0-2 Chelsea\nChelsea stopped the rot after successive Premier League defeats as they ground down Hull at the KCOM Stadium.\nThe hosts enjoyed the better of a cagey first half but went behind when Willian swept home a curling shot after good work from Diego Costa after the break.\nCosta found the top corner with a similar strike to double the lead after Nemanja Matic's powerful run.\nHull never recovered and could have been further behind but for Pedro's poor finishing from six yards.\nRelive Chelsea's win at Hull City\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nChanged formation, changed fortunes\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte promised \"a solution\" after his side went down with a whimper against Arsenal last weekend and he found his answer in a strategy he used at former club Juventus.\nThe Italian opted for a three-man defence during much of this trophy-filled time in Turin and deployed Gary Cahill, David Luiz and Cesar Azpilicueta at the back as he organised his Chelsea rearguard to match.\nIt did not initially appear to have stabilised a side who had conceded nine goals in their last four games in all competitions.\nLuiz lost track of Dieumerci Mbokani as he apparently struggled with the extra space he and his team-mates had to cover and was fortunate that the Hull striker's control betrayed him.\nBut the defence, along with the team as a whole, improved markedly after half-time and never looked like blemishing only their second clean sheet of the season.\nMoses delivers message\nThe chief beneficiary of Conte's reorganisation was Victor Moses.\nThe 25-year-old's last Premier League start for Chelsea was in a 2-1 win over Aston Villa in May 2013 when Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Juan Mata were among his team-mates.\nLoan spells at Liverpool, Stoke and West Ham followed, but the Nigeria international should not have to wait as long for his next appearance.\nPlaying as a right-sided wing-back, he was industrious and inventive and might have earned a first-half penalty when his trickery lured Hull forward Adama Diomande into a rash challenge.\nWillian and Costa's precise efforts decided the destination of the three points, but Moses will be most pleased with his day's work.\nReality catching up with Hull\nEven the most ardent Hull fan will not have expected their season to continue in the way it started.\nBut equally they will be alarmed by how the Tigers' form has flat-lined after wins over champions Leicester and Swansea in their first two games. They have taken just one point from their last five games and are three points above the relegation zone.\nHad Robert Snodgrass's early deflected effort not been brilliantly tipped over the top by Thibaut Courtois, it might well have been different.\nBut the hosts' defensive resilience wilted in the second half and the more they chased the game, they more vulnerable they looked.\nThe uncertainty over manager Mike Phelan's contract is an unwelcome distraction for a side who will need to be fully focused to turn their scant resources into survival.\nMan of the match - Victor Moses\nWhat they said\nHull caretaker manager Mike Phelan: \"We were quite pleased we created a few issues for them in the first half, but we expect a team like Chelsea to ramp up the pressure a little bit.\n\"It has been difficult to get forward but we're not playing Mickey Mouse teams here. We have to be sensible with our approach and can't just be open against these teams.\n\"My situation has fluctuated from week to week but we're not far apart. We are talking and having lunches together, the owners and I. It's just a case of where it all stands.\n\"Now we have to get together and move forward. We have a few more games now where we can hopefully be competitive. I don't think there's any issues with the players who are here, they are trying to win football matches.\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"Every game is very tough in England and I am pleased with our performance because we scored two goal and got a clean sheet. I saw the right pressure and the right intensity from the players.\n\"After these two defeats it's not easy to work because two defeats for Chelsea are heavy defeats. But this was a good answer.\n\"I saw many of the players with great commitment, attitude and will to change the situation. I am pleased for them.\n\"We must follow this with work, work, work!\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea kept their first clean sheet in eight away Premier League games, since a 4-0 win at Aston Villa in April.\nSince Diego Costa joined Chelsea, only Sergio Aguero (55) and Harry Kane (48) have scored more Premier League goals than the Spain international (38).\nIn all competitions, Chelsea are unbeaten in their last 13 meetings with Hull, winning 11 and drawing two.\nSince Adama Diomande's strike against Leicester on the opening day, Hull have failed to score a first-half goal in each of their last six Premier League matches.\nN'Golo Kante made more passes (79), more successful passes (70) and had more touches (95) against Hull than he had in any of his previous 43 Premier League matches.\nWhat's next?\nHull take the long trip to Bournemouth on Saturday, 15 October after the international break. Chelsea are at home to champions Leicester on the same day in the 12:30 BST kick-off."

        "article_text": "Sunderland 1-1 West Bromwich Albion\nPatrick van Aanholt came off the bench to score a late equaliser for Sunderland as they ended a run of three straight defeats - but remained in the Premier League relegation zone - with a draw against West Brom.\nNacer Chadli's third league goal of the season, against the run of play, looked set to inflict a sixth league defeat in seven games on David Moyes' side, who showed spirit to fight back.\nDutch substitute Van Aanholt, usually a left-back but playing higher up the pitch here, started and finished the leveller - his scuffed shot bouncing into the ground and looping beyond Ben Foster.\nDefeat would have saddled Moyes' winless team with the record for the worst start to a season in Premier League history and although their prospects remain bleak, this match at least offered the manager hope for the rest of the season.\nThey were the better side in the first half and should have taken the lead, only for Jermain Defoe to uncharacteristically drag an effort wide from 12 yards.\nThe second half was often drab, with neither side particularly impressing, but Sunderland's players at least showed the character and desire Moyes has been demanding.\nRelive Sunderland 1-1 West Brom as it happened\nFollow reaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nMoyes' players respond\nMoyes blamed his players for their failure to hold on to a two-goal lead as they lost 3-2 at home to Crystal Palace last weekend, calling on them to assume responsibility.\nBeforehand, the manager had admitted: \"I don't know what I'm going to get from my team.\" On this occasion, his players were energised and more reliable defensively than in previous matches.\nThe return of the experienced John O'Shea, for his first league start of the season, added ballast to the back line and had Defoe been more lethal in front of goal it could have been a different tale.\nNot only did the former Tottenham and England striker miss an easy first-half chance but he also had an effort blocked by Jonny Evans after the break.\nDefoe's profligacy was an alien sight. But seeing Sunderland scrap for survival is not - they have avoided relegation narrowly in each of the last five seasons and despite the promise of this display, they will be battling at the bottom once again this time around.\nBut in Duncan Watmore at least the hosts have a player for the future, with the confidence to attack at pace. It was the 22-year-old winger's driving run and imaginative cut-back that set up Van Aanholt.\nThe scorer celebrated his strike with Ishtiaq Rehman, the club doctor working his notice after resigning in the wake of a review of staffing.\n, external\nIs Pulis silencing his critics?\nIt was on 10 September, during a match at Bournemouth which ended in defeat, that West Brom fans started to turn on their manager Tony Pulis for the team's style of play.\nA run of one win in 14 matches, combined with a disagreement between manager and board over the club's summer transfer activity, made the Welshman the bookmakers' favourite to become the first Premier League manager to lose his job.\nBut a tally of five points from three matches since then have given those predicting Pulis' demise food for thought, with West Brom now ninth.\nPulis said he was disappointed at his team's failure to hold out at the Stadium of Light, but if they are to see off teams more often, the Baggies need to be more creative.\nIn Nacer Chadli - a club-record \u00a313m signing from Tottenham this summer - they do at least have a player with the ruthlessness to capitalise when chances are created in his current form.\nThe 27-year-old was set free by Matt Phillips and beat Jordan Pickford with a low strike inside the far post for his third goal in four league games, which is as many as he scored in his previous 30 league matches at Tottenham.\nMan of the Match - Duncan Watmore\nWhat the managers said\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"We didn't deserve to be 1-0 down. I'm still disappointed we didn't take the three points.\n\"Their energy and commitment was great. Undoubtedly we're lacking quality. We had no forward players to put on - Patrick van Aanholt came on and got us a goal.\n\"We defended much better today - that's a positive. The point gives us something to build on. We needed the three points though.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"We needed a second goal. We had 21 crosses and 18 shots.\n\"When you're 1-0 up, there's always a chance to make a mistake and they can score. Fair play to Sunderland - they kept at it. Their supporters were fantastic and got behind them.\n\"They had a lot of possession - but we were happy to let them play backwards and square. We had good runners, but just lacked quality in the final third.\n\"We're desperately disappointed not to have won. We're not doing too badly. It's progress. Although it's slow, it's progress.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nNacer Chadli has been involved in five of West Brom's last six Premier League goals (three goals, two assists).\nThis was David Moyes' 468th Premier League game as a manager - the fourth highest total of any manager in the competition.\nThe Black Cats have failed to win any of their opening seven Premier League games in three of the last four seasons.\nAll six of Sunderland's Premier League goals this season have been scored by either Jermain Defoe (four) or Patrick van Aanholt (two).\nFour of the last five Premier League meetings between these sides have ended in a draw (one win for West Brom) - just three of the previous 14 games between them in the competition had ended level.\nWhat next?\nThe international break gives Sunderland time to reassess before they travel to fellow strugglers Stoke on 15 October. West Brom host Tottenham on the same day."

Indeed, they are the only Premier League side yet to score a first half goal this term.\nWhat they said:\nStoke manger Mark Hughes: \"I'm really pleased with the performance we put in today. We had a good game plan and executed to the letter.\n\"You have to play well to get anything from Old Trafford. We were solid and looked dangerous on the break.\n\"Joe Allen was immense for us today. He has got great energy and awareness and sees things earlier than most people.\n\"When you come to places like Old Trafford your keeper has to have a good day and that happened. He saved many number of shots. He's a good keeper, a good character, and we're pleased he's with us.\n\"We're more like the Stoke that we know we can be. We've got players back, continuity at the back so that's helping us. We've found a form and a mix of players which will help us short term, if not long term.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United travel to rivals Liverpool after the international break. The teams meet at 20:00 BST on Monday 17 October. Stoke play Sunderland on Saturday 15 October."

They played better. We conceded too many chances to score a goal.\n\"I recognise they played better than us. Fortunately we finished with a draw from the match.\"\nOn playing Champions League games in midweek: \"Everything is a new experience. Now I have to decide whether to give a rest to players.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"We had the possibilities to win the game. It is a little disappointing at the end of the game because I thought we could have won.\n\"It is positive for the future. It is important for the squad to take confidence.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester have won just eight points from their opening seven games - the joint-second lowest return by a defending Premier League champion (Chelsea had eight points at the same stage in 2015/16).\nLeicester have had two goalless draws in seven Premier League games this season - as many as they did in the entire 2015/16 campaign.\nThe Foxes failed to score for just the second time in their last 27 matches in all competitions.\nSouthampton are unbeaten in their last six matches in all competitions, keeping six clean sheets in the process (W4 D2).\nWhat next?\nLeicester City's next game takes them to manager Ranieri's former club Chelsea for the 12:30 BST game on Saturday, 15 October.

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Manchester City\nTottenham deservedly ended Pep Guardiola's perfect Premier League start and underlined their own title credentials with a thrilling victory over Manchester City at White Hart Lane.\nGuardiola had won his previous six games and 10 of his previous 11 matches in charge, but City were outplayed by a vibrant Spurs who moved second in the table and are now the league's only unbeaten team.\nSpurs dominated from the start and were in front early on when Aleksandar Kolarov sliced Danny Rose's cross into his own net after nine minutes.\nDele Alli confirmed their superiority eight minutes before half-time with a cool finish from Son Heung-min's pass.\nSpurs could even afford the luxury of seeing Erik Lamela's second-half penalty saved by City keeper Claudio Bravo, and even though Sergio Aguero twice brought Hugo Lloris into action, once when he turned a shot on to the post, Mauricio Pochettino's side fully deserved a convincing win.\nRead more from Phil: How Guardiola was handed a reality check\nMOTD2 analysis: How Spurs perfected Pochettino plan\nListen: 5 live Football Daily: Have Spurs opened up the title race?\nAre Spurs title contenders?\nIf Liverpool are being touted as potential title winners after their fourth successive Premier League win at Swansea City on Saturday, then it is positively insulting to Tottenham not to elevate them to the same bracket after this pulsating performance.\nSpurs took charge from the first whistle against a City side many felt were shaping up to run away with the title - barely allowing Guardiola's side a second to breathe and refusing to allow them any time to impose their passing game.\nAnd it was all done without main marksman Harry Kane, who is sidelined with an ankle injury.\nIn many respects this was the first time Spurs have fully hit their stride this season, and what a time to do it.\nOn days like this the team that pushed Leicester long and hard for last season's Premier League title look the complete package from back to front.\nThey have a reliable keeper in Hugo Lloris, strength in defence in the shape of Jan Vertongen and Toby Alderweireld allied to the midfield power of Victor Wanyama and Moussa Sissoko plus the creation of Christian Eriksen, Alli and Son.\nThis was a big statement.\nMan City beaten at their own game\nGuardiola prides himself on the high pressing style of his side and work on the ball once they gain possession - they were beaten in all aspects of this by Spurs.\nOne moment early in the second half summed up the way Spurs went about their business.\nKeeper Bravo was hurried into a clearance and when Nicolas Otamendi received the ball seconds later, he was surrounded and sliced the ball into touch to the obvious delight of Pochettino.\nIt is City's first defeat under Guardiola, so hardly time for a mass inquest - but Spurs may have shown there is a way to unsettle his multi-talented side.\nSpurs cope better with injuries to key players\nSpurs and Manchester City were both missing big players in Kane and Kevin de Bruyne respectively - and there was no doubt who coped better.\nPochettino understandably maintained faith in the revitalised South Korean Son. His energy in attack, while also acting as their first line of defence, typified Spurs and suited their style more than the physical presence of \u00a317m summer signing Vincent Janssen.\nCity showed the odd flash from Aguero but Raheem Sterling could not exert any influence, with David Silva also marginalised.\nAs stated before, City remain a squad of high quality but how they missed the moments of magic that Belgium midfielder De Bruyne can provide for them.\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min\nWhat they said:\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino:\n\"It was a great, great victory for us against this opposition. I am very happy. Sometimes when you have a plan, it is good, sometimes less so, but Manchester City are a great team. It is difficult to play against them.\n\"We need to follow this after the international match and we have more tough games after the international break. If you play like we did today with passion and aggression then you will always have a chance. It is always about mentality. That is what helps us run and play as we want to.\n\"The collective performance was strong. It is too early to take this into the table yet. We are still creating our philosophy.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardolia:\n\"It was a tough game, we knew that. Tottenham have been a very good team for the last three years, fighting. We were little late in all aspects. We could not have so many chances, in many aspects they were better than us.\n\"It is October, you cannot imagine what my team has already done. I am new here. So far it has been an amazing performance but we need more, we have to work more, it is what it is.\n\"I never thought that we would not lose a game, you can't imagine that. It is normal to the process, sometimes it happens and it can help us improve.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nPep Guardiola lost his first league game as a manager since a 2-1 home defeat to Mainz in March while he was in charge of Bayern Munich.\nSon Heung-min has been involved in eight goals in his last seven Premier League games (six goals, two assists).\nManchester City had not trailed in the Premier League this season before Aleksandar Kolarov's own goal.\nSpurs have missed three consecutive penalties against Manchester City, Roberto Soldado and Jermain Defoe the others to miss before Erik Lamela on Sunday.\nCity have never won a Premier League game when they have been two or more goals down at half-time (D1 L48).\nSpurs have made their best ever start to a league season, collecting 17 points from their opening seven matches.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Tottenham face West Brom at The Hawthorns on Saturday 15 October (15:00 BST), while Manchester City will look for some home comforts at Etihad Stadium as they host Everton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-1 Arsenal\nBurnley suffered a cruel defeat at Turf Moor as Arsenal secured victory with a controversial Laurent Koscielny goal in the final act of an intriguing match.\nIn added time, Theo Walcott headed across goal towards Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain whose effort went in off what appeared to be Koscielny's elbow.\nAs well as a possible handball, there was also a hint of offside with captain Koscielny standing on the goalline.\nMichael Keane had Burnley's best chance, heading on to the crossbar.\nBut despite the Clarets' fine defensive display, with Keane in particular impressing as they shut out Arsenal until the 94th minute, they came away with no points for their efforts.\nThe win allowed Arsenal to close the gap on league leaders Manchester City, who lost 2-0 at Tottenham in one of Sunday's earlier kick-offs, to two points while overtaking Liverpool to claim third place.\nManager Arsene Wenger admitted his team were fortunate in victory but with this result at Turf Moor, and convincing victories over Chelsea in the league and Basel in the Champions League in the last week, the north Londoners have hit a fine run of form, extending their unbeaten stretch to six league games.\nHandball or not?\nImmediately after the match, Koscielny - who was credited with the goal - said he did not know whether he had handled. \"I tried with my right foot and I don't know if I touch it with my hand,\" the Frenchman said.\nEven though Burnley did not appeal for handball at the time, their manager Sean Dyche said afterwards the ball \"quite clearly\" hit the defender's hand.\nTo add to the confusion Arsenal's winner caused, Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrated as if he had scored but the England international's shot did appear to hit Koscielny's arm before it crossed the line, while Dyche even suggested that it was the Arsenal captain who kicked the ball on to his own arm.\nAs another caveat, if it were the case that Oxlade-Chamberlain did kick the ball on to Koscielny's arm, the defender would have been in an offside position.\n\"You have to question the added time, the corner and whether it should have come in, the handball and question whether we should have dealt with it,\" added Dyche. \"It's a poor way to end a game.\"\nBut no matter what the theories or Dyche's thoughts, referee Craig Pawson saw nothing wrong with the winner which secured Arsenal a fifth successive Premier League win and ensured another win for Wenger as the 21st year of the 66-year-old's reign began.\nArsenal stifled until late on\nArsenal were their usual selves in possession - accurate and dominant - but their pleasing-on-the-eye play would often break down as soon as they closed in on the Burnley box, in the first half especially.\nThe visitors had just one shot on target before the break - a trifling Mesut Ozil attempt in the 16th minute - and so organised were Burnley in defence, it quickly became clear why Dyche's side had conceded only five goals in their last 17 league games at home before this match.\nOzil was as disappointing as he was effervescent in the 3-0 win over Chelsea, his game summed up with a wayward shot which sailed into the stands when there were better options available to him.\nWenger admitted his team were jaded after three matches in eight days.\n\"We lacked sharpness and our legs were heavy and that was a game we could win 1-0 and also lose 1-0 on set-pieces,\" the Frenchman said.\nAs the match progressed, the Gunners threatened more with Alexis Sanchez their most dangerous player, forcing a low save from goalkeeper Tom Heaton and then striking the bottom corner of the post after Burnley had failed to deal with an Ozil cross.\nHeartbreak for Burnley\nEight points from their opening seven league games is a decent start for the newly promoted side, but that will not mask the disappointment of losing in such a manner on what was their fifth home game of the season.\nThe hosts went into the break wondering what could have been, with Sam Vokes squandering the best chance of the half as the Wales international - unmarked six yards from goal - headed Matt Lowton's chipped cross wide when he had only Petr Cech to beat, and that is how they also ended the match.\nDyche's men had to wait until the 60th minute for their first and only shot on target.\nJohann Berg Gudmundsson out-jumped Koscielny to scare Cech with his header, while moments later Walcott was forced to scramble Vokes' header clear to prevent a second chance from opening up for Gudmundsson.\nWhile Burnley deserved at least a draw, their profligacy in front of goal, as well as their failure to hit the target - they have only managed 16 shots on target in the league this season - is concerning.\nMan of the Match - Michael Keane (Burnley)\nThe stats you need to know\nBurnley are winless in eight league games against the Gunners (D3 L5), losing each of the last four in the Premier League.\nOnly Liverpool (28) have scored more 90th-minute winning goals in the Premier League than Arsenal (23).\nArsenal have won five successive Premier League games for the first time since October 2015, and kept back-to-back clean sheets for the first time this season.\nNeither Burnley nor Arsenal have scored more than one goal at Turf Moor in their last four league meetings (0-0, 1-1, 0-1 and 0-1).\nBurnley have scored just five goals in their opening seven Premier League games; the joint-fewest in the competition so far (along with Stoke).\nOnly Hull City (93) have faced more shots (including blocks) than Burnley (84) at home in the Premier League this season, despite the Clarets conceding just three times at Turf Moor.\nWhat next?\nThe international break means Arsenal's next match - at home to struggling Swansea - will not be until 15 October. Meanwhile Burnley, 14th in the league, face a tough trip to Southampton on 16 October."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-0 Leicester City\nChelsea condemned defending Premier League champions Leicester to a fourth consecutive away defeat with a dominant display at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Blues were ahead inside seven minutes when Nemanja Matic flicked on Eden Hazard's corner for Diego Costa to smash home.\nA David Luiz free-kick struck the post, before Pedro played in Hazard, who rounded Kasper Schmeichel to slot in.\nLuiz hit his own post when clearing a cross, but Victor Moses' finish after a one-two with substitute Nathaniel Chalobah completed the scoring.\nLeicester, who left Riyad Mahrez on the bench for the first time in 36 league games, failed to register a shot on target as they struggled to cope against Chelsea's aggressive pressing and quick passing.\nDefeat leaves Claudio Ranieri's side with eight points from their first eight games - the joint second lowest haul by a defending Premier League champion, along with Chelsea's team of last season.\nRelive Chelsea v Leicester\nThe Kante derby\nSince joining Chelsea from Leicester this summer, N'Golo Kante has found himself doing slightly less of the defensive work that established him as such a prized midfielder at the King Power Stadium.\nBut he continues to enjoy the gift of being in the right place at the right time and this was another excellent performance from the France international - who is clearly missed by Claudio Ranieri's side.\nHowever, much of Chelsea's success in stifling the visitors came courtesy of their wing-backs. When Marcos Alonso - making his home debut - harried Danny Drinkwater high up the pitch to win the ball back and deliver a dangerous low cross, he was repeating the pattern set by Moses on the opposite right flank.\nInstead we saw the other side of Kante's game. The 25-year-old would have scored Chelsea's third had it not been for Foxes captain Wes Morgan, who made a brilliant block after a Costa cross spilled off Schmeichel's legs to leave the goalmouth exposed.\nAnd his perfectly weighted through ball deserved a better finish from Moses, who eventually did settle the points for certain when latching on to a delightful flick by 21-year-old English midfielder Chalobah - making his senior home debut after six loan spells away from the club.\nDon't believe the rumours\nOn Thursday, several bookmakers suspended betting on Chelsea boss Conte being the next Premier League manager to lose his job.\nThe Italian laughed off the rumours in his news conference on Friday -\"I am trying to find out who put the money on\" - but some may have wondered if there would be a sign of weakness in his side's performance.\nThere was not. Chelsea began with real swagger and Costa's early goal was the end product. The Premier League's top scorer gambled on a late move to the back post and, as Morgan did not stay with him, was left with an easy finish for his seventh of the campaign. It took the 28-year-old Spain striker until January to reach that total last season.\nThe dipping Luiz free-kick that crashed against the post would have been a fitting second, so when Hazard found himself through on goal after a slightly lucky bounce it was hard to deny a 2-0 lead was deserved. The Belgium winger showed superb composure for his third goal from eight matches this season - compared to four from 31 last term.\nAnd one of the finest flourishes came from Conte himself. There was a huge round of cheers from the home crowd when he brilliantly trapped a misplaced long pass that plummeted down into his technical area.\nThe fans will have found it hard not to have been incredibly impressed by their team's performance - especially after what they witnessed over 2015-16.\nMan of the match - N'Golo Kante (Chelsea)\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"When you concede a goal from a corner again it is clear: you come to Chelsea and your attention must be at the maximum. We made mistakes. We tried to react and the second half was much better. Now we must react because we have the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\"If we scored the goal when we create a chance we can re-open the match. But our approach to the match was not good. Maybe we were a little nervous.\n\"It is better that this happens now and we can react than at the end of the season. We must concentrate more.\n\"We miss him [N'Golo Kante] - but we have to play better.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"It was a good game. From the start I asked them to play well with intensity and to try to do what we are doing in training.\n\"I am very happy because I had a good reply. This is the best game for us.

I've got a team here who show what they can do when they want to.\n\"We've got to grow up. Unless we concentrate and be disciplined, we won't get to where we want. What we've done today is not good enough.\n\"I thought we were victims of our own downfall in some respects. We're conceding far too many and I'll take responsibility for that.\n\"I will look at myself, players will look at themselves and we start again. We'll learn, but we have to learn quickly.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBournemouth have scored six goals in a Premier League game for the first time.\nHull conceded six goals in a Premier League game for only the second time.\nAfter nine games without a goal or assist, Junior Stanislas has scored three and assisted another two in his past three Premier League games.\nBournemouth's total of 22 shots (including blocked) is their highest ever in a Premier League match.\nHull City have lost four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2014.\nWhat's next?\nHull host Stoke City at the KCOM Stadium on Saturday, 22 October, while Bournemouth welcome Tottenham on the same day in the 12:30 BST kick-off."

But it would be wrong to be overly negative about this display.\nThey were competitive early on but two defensive lapses left them facing a deficit they almost clawed back.\nWalcott was on hand from close range to punish them and he has now scored as many goals in eight outings as he did in all 28 of his Premier League appearances last season.\nThe 27-year-old has only ever reached double figures once in a league season, scoring 14 times in the 2012-13 campaign.\nBut he seemed hungry in front of goal, with six shots - a game high - and showed instinct to sense Amat would have difficulty dealing with a bouncing ball, allowing him to prod the opener.\nWalcott's approach play was also sharp - completing 92% of his passes - and he worked hard too, with only Santi Cazorla and Hector Bellerin covering more ground for Arsene Wenger's side.\nLate on he missed two one-on-one chances for his hat-trick, the first of which saw him strike the post and watch as the ball rolled agonisingly back across the goalline.\nBradley gives Swansea bite\nWalcott's late misses were among 16 Arsenal shots - but Swansea managed 13 themselves.\nIn their previous away fixture against Southampton in September, they managed just six, so there was an undoubted intent on show in Bradley's first game.\nThe Premier League's first American manager has talked of a \"fresh start\" for everyone at the club.\nBarrow, who has been out on loan twice since joining in 2014, clearly sought to impress as he constantly outwitted Nacho Monreal to deliver crosses, most notably when picking out Borja who finished from 10 yards.\nHis energy and drive perhaps summed up Swansea's spirit. Yes, they look at risk in the bottom three - but in acting early in the campaign, the club's hierarchy have given Bradley plenty of time to right things.\nHe may not have been able to match former Swans managers Michael Laudrup, Garry Monk and Francesco Guidolin in winning at Emirates Stadium, but the visiting supporters should leave with optimism.\nRead: 'We can be a really good team' - Bradley\nXhaka madness, Wenger optimism...\nXhaka was Arsenal's main negative during what was at times a thrilling encounter. His error for Sigurdsson's excellent finish gave Swansea a footing, his late kick on Barrow almost put his side under more pressure than they could take.\nWenger said he would not appeal the dismissal but admitted it \"made it difficult for us\" after watching his goalkeeper Petr Cech save headers from Leroy Fer and Federico Fernandez late on.\nThe erratic display by his \u00a335m signing may prompt concern, but Wenger should be pleased to see what he called \"good solidarity\" to hold on for the win.\nThe recent international break marked 20 years at the club for the Frenchman. With his contract up in the summer, how many more chances will he have to guide Arsenal to their first title since 2004?\nHis side have trailed for just 52 minutes in the league this season. They have been solid and when questioned by Swansea they found the grit which will undoubtedly be needed if they are to end their title wait.\nMan of the match - Theo Walcott\nWhat they said...\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"I have some mixed feelings because it looked at some points comfortable and then it never was.\n\"We have the same number of points as Manchester City so it's down to us to continue.\n\"If you look at the game the potential is very interesting but we have to be intelligent enough to improve.\"\nSwansea manager Bob Bradley: \"That game had many different parts. We started poorly.\n\"Defensively the first two goals were not handled well, but we gave ourselves a real chance.\n\"We are confident we can turn this around. After the week of training we have just had and the mentality of the team, for me we are going to become a good team.\"\nThe stats you need to know...\nThe Gunners are the only Premier League side to have won (30) more games than they've lost (26) when they've had a player sent off.\nSwansea lost their first Premier League match at the Emirates since their first ever visit to the stadium in September 2011.\nThe Swans have lost four consecutive Premier League games in a single season for the first time since April 2012.\nUp next...\nArsenal face Bulgarian side Ludogrets in the Champions League on Wednesday (19:45 BST kick-off) before hosting Middlesbrough at 15:00 next Saturday. Swansea will look to end their run of seven league games without a win when they host Watford next Saturday (15:00)."

For all Manchester City's dominance you have to praise what has been a gallant performance by Everton.\n\"You look at the two managers and Ronald Koeman will be happier than Pep Guardiola.

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur\nDele Alli's equaliser a minute from time ensured Tottenham maintained their unbeaten start to the season and remained within a point of Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nNacer Chadli's late goal for West Brom seemed set to inflict an unlikely first defeat of the season on in-form Spurs.\nBut Mauricio Pochettino's men fought back as substitute Son Heung-Min and Christian Eriksen combined to create the opportunity for England international Alli to prod the ball home with the outside of his boot.\nIt was thanks to a series of fine first-half saves from Ben Foster, 33, that the hosts were still in contention at the break, with Alli admitting his team could have scored \"three or four\" were it not for the former England goalkeeper.\nBut despite enjoying less than 30% of possession, West Brom were worthy of a draw, improving considerably as an attacking force after the interval.\nEriksen could have snatched victory with a free-kick aimed towards the top-right corner in the last action of the match but, once again, the outstretched Foster kept out the Dane's curling effort.\nThe draw ensures Tottenham are unbeaten in the opening eight league matches of the season for the first time since 1990, but it also allowed north London rivals Arsenal to leapfrog them into second in the table with victory over Swansea.\nTottenham show character to bounce back\nIt was widely thought Tottenham gave their best display of the Mauricio Pochettino era in beating Manchester City 2-0 on their last league outing.\nThis time they lacked the verve they displayed in that win over City, but the determination they displayed confirms their title credentials in what is their best start to a top-flight season since they began their 1960-61 title-winning campaign with 11 straight wins.\n\"We're still unbeaten and that's the important thing,\" said their Argentine manager, who praised West Brom's Foster for a \"great performance\".\nTottenham dominated the first half - enjoying 76% of possession and creating 10 shots on goal (five of which were on target).\nThe excellent Foster dived low to prevent Ben Davies from finding the bottom-right corner, twice denied Eriksen and also stopped Alli from putting Spurs ahead when the England forward had been allowed to surge forward unchallenged.\nWorrying perhaps for the visitors, however, was the second-half injury to Toby Alderweireld which forced the influential defender to leave the pitch on a stretcher.\nIt was an innocuous collision with his team-mate Jan Vertonghen, the latter clipping his fellow centre-back's knee, which ended the Belgian's participation.\nWest Brom continue to pick up points\nPredictably, West Brom sat deep and frustrated Spurs. Starved of possession - they made 104 passes in the first half compared to Tottenham's 345 - Tony Pulis' men had to rely on a Tottenham mistake for their best chance of the opening period.\nWhen Hugo Lloris failed to safely gather James McClean's long-range shot, Salomon Rondon had a chance to take advantage three yards from the goalline, but the France goalkeeper saved himself by swiping the ball away from the home striker's feet.\nFoster admitted after the final whistle his team never had any intention of vying with their opponents for possession.\n\"It's a classic Tony Pulis team,\" said the goalkeeper. \"When you come up against teams like Tottenham, you know you won't be able to outplay them.\"\nBut the hosts weathered the first-half storm and posed more problems after the break with Gareth McAuley squandering a fine chance in front of goal before Chadli struck for his fourth goal in five Premier League games.\nWith less than 10 minutes remaining, Chadli pounced on a McClean strike which rebounded off the bottom of the post. It proved not to be the winner, but the goal did help extend West Brom's unbeaten league run to four matches.\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nMan of the Match - Ben Foster (West Brom)\nAnalysis\nFormer Everton and Chelsea winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think Spurs are a strong side but whether they've got enough strength in depth to keep it going in the Premier League and the Champions League is questionable.\n\"If they want to be challengers and maybe even win the Premier League, the best thing that could happen to them is to be knocked out of the Champions League pretty early.\nListen to more from Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live\nWhat the managers said\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"In the first half I thought they were fantastic. We sat off them and they showed what they can do, but in the second half we were much better.\n\"When you look at the result as a whole, we're pleased with the point because they've got a top team. With the quality they've got they can score in the last minute, as they did, or injury time. They're real quality and put you on the back foot because of the pace and quality that they've got.\n\"Tottenham are a good side and we're pleased to have taken a point from a team that are, and will be, one of the top three or four in the league this season.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"I'm a little bit disappointed because we dominated the game and created better chances, but we know every time we play West Brom it's going to be difficult.\n\"In the first half we dominated but the same thing always happens in football if you don't score. Foster was man of the match. It was difficult when we conceded the goal and the team showed character.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nWest Brom have drawn each of their last three top-flight games 1-1, with the Baggies scoring more than once in only one of their past 18 games (4-2 v West Ham in September).\nThe Baggies have conceded a league-low one first-half goal in the Premier League this season (versus Everton in August).\nNacer Chadli has been involved in six goals in his five Premier League games this season (four goals, two assists).\nChadli has netted four goals in his five top-flight games for West Brom, as many in his previous 33 for Tottenham.\nWhat next?\nWest Brom's next three fixtures are tough ones, against Liverpool (away), Manchester City (home) and Leicester City (away).\nTottenham's match against the Baggies was their first of seven in 23 days. Their next task will be to tackle Bayern Leverkusen in the Champions League on 18 October before travelling to Bournemouth in the league on 22 October."

His good form comes at the perfect time for his manager Mark Hughes, whose position has come under scrutiny after a poor start to the season.\nAgainst Sunderland Allen showed a great understanding in midfield with the outstanding Arnautovic, reading the Austrian's intentions for the opener and timing his run into the area perfectly to beat the Sunderland defenders to a pinpoint cross.\nHis second came after more poor Black Cats defending. A Ryan Shawcross header from a corner was not adequately cleared by the visitors and the ball arrived at the feet of the Welshman who struck home a carefully-placed low shot.\n\"Things happen to be falling for me at the moment, so I can't complain,\" Allen told BBC Sport.\nStoke are 18th with six points after the win, level on points with 17th place Middlesbrough.\nDesperate times for Sunderland\nOne shot on target was all that the visitors managed at Stoke. That was Wahbi Khazri's free-kick which was easily saved by Lee Grant.\nThe Stoke keeper barely got his gloves dirty with Sunderland's attacking forays often breaking down on the edge of the area.\nTunisian midfielder Khazri was their outstanding performer. He played like a veteran NFL quarterback in a team of rookie wide receivers, with neither striker Jermain Defoe nor Duncan Watmore able to read his play.\nWatmore was particularly wasteful. The former Manchester United youth player produced a good run down the right in the first half, which ended with a poor cross. He then charged through the Stoke midfield in the second period but fired horribly wide instead of looking up and finding a team-mate.\nThe Black Cats have only managed to score six times in the league this season - it is hard to know where the goals will come from.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic (Stoke)\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland are only the second team in top-flight history to fail to win any of their opening eight league games in consecutive seasons (after Bury in 1905-06)\nStoke kept their first clean sheet in their past 18 top-flight games\nAllen has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time in his career\nThe Welshman netted his first brace and has now matched his best goal haul for a top-flight season (2011-12)\nArnautovic is the first Stoke player to provide an assist in the Premier League this season\nManager reaction\nStoke boss Mark Hughes:\n\"It has certainly been coming - that has been the overwhelming feeling within the camp.\n\"I think when you take the last four games into account, even against Hull and West Brom when results didn't quite go to plan, there was a marked improvement in what we produced.\n\"We continued that at Old Trafford and earned a tremendous point against them, and since then have been itching to get back on the pitch in front of our own supporters.\n\"We were able to do that today, we played with confidence and I don't think anybody can argue about the outcome of the game.\"\nSunderland boss David Moyes:\n\"We did some good things but conceded a terrible goal for the first. We played better than we had done in recent games but we had to make sure we got to half-time at 1-0 down.\n\"We need to get better in all areas. But what I've seen in training recently tells me we're getting there, especially with our work on the ball.\n\"It was an inexperienced team out there but we're trying to get them better, we're working on them.\n\"When you've got supporters like Sunderland you're always going to be there and be successful and they were outstanding again today.\"\nWhat's next?\nThe Black Cats are at West Ham next Saturday (15:00 BST) and Stoke are away at Hull (15:00 BST) who were defeated 6-1 by Bournemouth on Saturday."

We produced a really good performance.\n\"The second yellow card was an extremely, extremely harsh decision. Those two decisions were not correct. I don't like to moan. I'm the first to say it's very hard for referees... but those two decisions today... thank God it didn't affect the result.\n\"It was by far Simone Zaza's best performance today. He won more balls in the air than in the previous games. I hope we have turned the corner. We need to repeat this. We have to have this kind of approach. It's a cruel league but I never stop believing.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Alan Pardew told BBC Sport: \"I was disappointed with a lot of aspects of the game.\n\"We didn't start well and they got a deserved lead. We had to make changes at half-time because weren't playing with the fluidity as we have done. We were better in the second half.\n\"We should have at least got a draw. With the penalty I was thinking with the week Benteke has had it'll go in.\n\"That would have been a lifeline and would have turned the game on its head. We would gave gone in 1-1 at half-time. This happens in the course of the season. Adrian made a good save at the end.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nFor the first time, West Ham have won three in a row away to Crystal Palace in the league\nThe Eagles have lost each of their past five Premier League London derbies at Selhurst Park\nSix of Manuel Lanzini's eight Premier League goals have come away from home\nLanzini has scored in each of West Ham's last three top-flight clashes with Palace (three goals in total)\nSince his debut in August 2014, Aaron Cresswell has provided nine assists in the Premier League, a haul only two other defenders can better (Janmaat 11, Baines 10)"

While he protested and claimed for a penalty, Holebas nipped in front of Cristhian Stuani to control a poor clearance, take a touch and then fire a swerving shot that former Barcelona keeper Valdes could only help into the top corner.\nIt was Watford's first shot on target but enough to give them the points.\nMan of the match - Isaac Success (Watford)\nThe stats you need to know\nWatford have two victories in their past three away Premier League games, having won just two of their previous 12.\nNo Premier League defender has had a hand in more goals this season than Jose Holebas (three - two goals and one assist).\nBoro have won just two of their past 18 home Premier League games (D10 L6).\nAnalysis\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Chris Sutton:\n\"Middlesbrough were pitiful going forward. Well - there wasn't any forward play.\n\"It looks like it's going to be a tough season for them. They are going to have to start winning at home. I have to say Alvaro Negredo didn't look like he wanted to be on the pitch.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live commentator Alan Green:\n\"I actually haven't seen anyone worse than Middlesbrough this season.\"\nWhat the managers said\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka:\n\"When they scored it was impossible to play. Watford have really experienced players. We need to learn and keep going.\n\"The only way we know how to play is the way we played the first 35 minutes.\"\nWatford boss Walter Mazzarri:\n\"I'm very satisfied because we won an away game in such a difficult stadium. I'm mainly (satisfied) with the character of the team but I'm less satisfied on the overall performance.\n\"I'm happy. It's going very well. We could've had one or two points more at this stage. We've been playing all the games well with the exception of Burnley away.\"\nWhat's next?\nMiddlesbrough travel to second-placed Arsenal next Saturday (15:00 BST kick-off), while Watford take on Swansea at the Liberty Stadium at the same time."

        "article_text": "Southampton 3-1 Burnley\nSouthampton moved to eighth in the Premier League as goals from Charlie Austin and Nathan Redmond punished Burnley's poor second-half defending.\nAustin broke the deadlock by poking home at the near post after Virgil van Dijk was allowed to head across the face of the goal from a corner.\nBurnley's defence was at fault again as Redmond beat Tom Heaton with a low strike from another corner.\nAustin scored from the spot before a Sam Vokes penalty reduced the arrears.\nFootball Daily: 'Comfortable' Saints continue unbeaten run\nBurnley's defence has crumbled on a number of occasions in the second half of games this season, though it was thanks to a series of fine saves from Heaton that the score remained goalless for as long as it did.\nThe injury to influential midfielder Steven Defour before the break also hampered the visitors' cause against a Southampton side who are now unbeaten in four league matches and still unbeaten at home this season.\nChances galore for Southampton\nSouthampton, without first-choice full-backs Cedric Soares and Ryan Bertrand, suffered a further defensive set-back early on. Matt Targett, Bertrand's replacement, injured his hamstring - but 21-year-old academy product Sam McQueen came on and performed well.\nThe Saints' defence was organised despite the changes - although they did concede their first goal in 612 minutes of play - and the hosts created plenty of chances, troubling Heaton with 34 shots, the highest total by any team in a Premier League game this season.\nHeaton has made more saves than any goalkeeper in the league - including 11 in this match. His most spectacular of them all arguably came in the fourth minute as he dived low towards the bottom right corner to stop Austin's close-range header.\nBut Burnley were caught out after the break when Van Dijk headed Dusan Tadic's corner towards Austin, who was standing two yards from goal. The former Burnley player needed two attempts, with his first effort blocked on the line by Vokes before he poked in the rebound.\nMoments after Heaton had made a brilliant save from Tadic, Burnley's defence folded again as Steven Davis' corner found the unmarked Redmond, who fired low beyond Heaton at his near post.\nThe visitors were rattled and it was no surprise that Southampton added to the scoreline, with Austin converting from the spot after Johann Berg Gudmundsson was deemed to have made contact with McQueen.\nSouthampton, particularly impressive in the closing stages as they charged forward in search of a fourth, came close to scoring again on a number of occasions with Davis, Jose Fonte, Jordy Clasie and Jay Rodriguez going close but they could not get past the overworked Heaton.\nShould Burnley have been awarded a first-half penalty?\nSean Dyche's team were unlucky to lose to a controversial 94th-minute winner by Arsenal during their last Premier League outing, but they were unable to frustrate a free-flowing Southampton on this occasion and were fortunate not to suffer a heavier defeat.\nThe visitors had strong cause to appeal for a penalty in the first half after Gudmundsson was felled by Van Dijk but referee Mike Dean, standing yards in front of the challenge, ignored their pleas.\nDyche said after the match that it was a decision which could have changed the course of the match.\nThe Burnley manager argued that there was \"minimal contact\" between Gudmundsson and McQueen for Southampton's penalty. However, it was also questionable whether Tadic's brush with Ben Mee for the visitors' spot-kick should have been punished.\nMan of the match - Charlie Austin (Southampton)\nWhat the managers said\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"I take pleasure this afternoon with a very good second half. It was very interesting to play this game. It was difficult in the first half after the injury of Matt Targett. We lost a little control of the game.\n\"After the injury, we came back with a good intention and situation. I think we could have scored many goals. I'm happy for my players.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"We should have had a penalty at 0-0, which would make the game different. That's stretching it a bit because they are a very good side but we needed that decision. It's beyond a good shout, it's an impossible decision to get wrong.\n\"They got a very soft penalty, minimal contact if any. But this is not making excuses, they could have scored more, but you need those decisions to go your way.\n\"Southampton are in good form, they break their shape and they are a side to be reckoned with.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSouthampton are unbeaten in nine Premier League games on home soil (won six, drawn three); a run bettered only by Leicester (19) and Liverpool (10).\nCharlie Austin has scored seven goals in his last six games in all competitions for Southampton.\nSouthampton had 34 shots (including blocks) against Burnley; their highest total in a Premier League game since 2003-04.\nThree of the last four Premier League goals conceded by Burnley have been from corners.\nSince the start of 2015-16, Mike Dean has awarded more penalties than any other referee in the Premier League (19).\nWhat next?\nSouthampton have a tough week ahead, visiting Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday before visiting Premier League leaders Manchester City next Sunday. Burnley host sixth-placed Everton next Saturday."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-0 Manchester United\nLiverpool and Manchester United played out a goalless and uneventful stalemate on a disappointing night at Anfield.\nJurgen Klopp's Liverpool would have drawn level on points with leaders Manchester City with a fifth successive Premier League victory, but were subdued by a classic Jose Mourinho performance of defensive organisation and discipline.\nUnited did not allow Liverpool to build the momentum and intensity that has characterised their game this season, while Mourinho's limited attacking ambitions ensured chances were at a premium.\nThe Portuguese was still grateful for two fine second-half saves from goalkeeper David de Gea, who dived low to stop Emre Can and saved athletically from Philippe Coutinho's 25-yard effort.\nUnited's best chance also came in the second half, but the unmarked Zlatan Ibrahimovic directed Paul Pogba's cross off target.\nThe visitors had just 35% of possession - their lowest in a Premier League match since Opta began recording the data in 2003-04.\nRelive Liverpool v Manchester United\nLiverpool not the last wonder of the world - Mourinho\nMourinho turns tables on Liverpool\nWhile this deadlock does little for the ambitions of both teams, there is no doubt who will be the happier manager.\nThis was, in so many respects, the most Mourinho performance of his short time at United.\nKlopp came on to the pitch at the final whistle to applaud Liverpool's fans, but there was a tinge of disappointment in his measured tread as he trudged off.\nHis side's promising start to the season has been built on pressing opponents into submission - a high-pressure style that has brought victories at Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as nine goals in two home wins against Leicester City and Hull City.\nBut Mourinho picked a powerful, athletic side and instructed them to turn the tables on Liverpool's pressing game.\nAnder Herrera was at the heart of United's smothering gameplan, almost operating in the pockets of Coutinho and Roberto Firmino in midfield, while Liverpool were never given a second.\nThey simply could not find a way through.\nUnited held their shape and discipline, much to their manager's satisfaction, although he still needed those two superb saves from De Gea, and a magnificent saving tackle from Antonio Valencia to stop Firmino as he raced in on goal.\nIt was classic Mourinho, a tactic he has perfected and utilised throughout his career, and Anfield's increasing anger and frustration will have been music to his ears.\nPeripheral Pogba\nThis match should have been the perfect stage for the \u00a389m Pogba - but once again he was a peripheral figure.\nThe world's most expensive player was used in a more advanced role and is certainly on the same wavelength as Ibrahimovic, delivering a perfect cross which the Swede should have converted.\nIn other aspects, though, he operated on the margins of the game and failed to exert the influence expected of a player of his quality and experience.\nUnited will expect much more as the season goes on.\nReferee Taylor keeps control\nAnthony Taylor was the man in the middle in every sense after the heat generated by the appointment of the Manchester-based official for a meeting between these two fierce rivals.\nMourinho said the appointment made it \"difficult\" for Taylor, and put him under pressure - comments being investigated by the Football Association - while former referee Keith Hackett even suggested it represented a risk to his and his family's safety.\nIt certainly increased the scrutiny on Taylor, who felt the wrath of The Kop within minutes - complete with colourful reminders about his place of residence - when he did not book Marcus Rashford for a foul on James Milner.\nIt was to the official's credit that he did not buckle in the atmosphere, kept discipline without resorting to a rash of yellow cards, and controlled a game that always has explosive potential.\nMan of the match - Ander Herrera\nWhat they said:\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I am not frustrated but I am not happy with the performance. No-one will show this game in 10 or 20 years but we could have played better.\n\"It was a hectic game, interrupted here and there, but we lost patience with our passing game. The attitude of my team was really good. We were ready to fight but when you can play better, you have to.\n\"The kind of defence is difficult to play. The man-marking is really difficult, they are stronger than us. We wasted energy in the first half for nothing. The second half was better and with fresher legs in second half we could have created more.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"It is not the result we wanted but it is a positive result. It is a result that stops a direct opponent getting three points at home, so not a bad result.\n\"The game was difficult for both teams but for longer periods it was more difficult for them than us.\n\"We controlled the game not just tactically but the emotion of the game. That was probably the quietest Anfield I had and I was expecting it to be the other way.\n\"It was a positive performance.\"\nAnalysis:\nFormer Wales midfielder Robbie Savage on BBC Radio 5 live: \"Liverpool have not played well tonight and United have done a job.\n\"It is the first points that Liverpool have dropped at Anfield. Mourinho has done his job.\n\"He got a point so it was the right thing to do. They lost a few games this season and have come to Liverpool and got a draw, so you have to say job done.\n\"But in an attacking sense they offered nothing.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nThis is only the second time in Premier League history a meeting between these sides has finished 0-0 (also September 2005).\nThis is Mourinho's lowest points total after his first eight league games with a new club since his stint with Uniao de Leiria (10 points).\nUnited had two more points at this stage last season under Louis van Gaal (16) than they do this season (14).\nLiverpool have failed to score in only two of their 18 home Premier League games under Klopp - both against United.\nAfter scoring with four of his first 15 shots in the Premier League, Ibrahimovic has failed to find the net with any of his past 26 in the competition.\nWhat next?\nUnited are next in action when they host Fenerbahce in the Europa League on Thursday (20:05 BST) before returning to Premier League action at Mourinho's former club Chelsea on Sunday (16:00 BST).\nLiverpool host West Brom in the 17:30 BST Premier League match on Saturday."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham missed the chance to move top of the Premier League - at least for a few hours - as they were held to a goalless draw at Bournemouth.\nBournemouth nearly took a shock early lead when Charlie Daniels' close-range effort following a corner was brilliantly saved by Hugo Lloris, the Spurs keeper reacting to deflect the ball onto the bar with his legs.\nSpurs' Erik Lamela then hit the crossbar at the other end, and though the visitors raised their game after the break, the Cherries held firm, with keeper Artur Boruc keeping out Dele Alli and Danny Rose, while Bournemouth substitute Benik Afobe headed just over late on.\nMeanwhile, referee Craig Pawson upset the home fans who felt Lamela should have been shown a second yellow card, while substitute Moussa Sissoko was not punished for an apparent elbow into Harry Arter's face.\nPawson then waved away late Bournemouth appeals for a penalty when Jack Wilshere went down after a challenge by Jan Vertonghen.\nRelive the action from Vitality Stadium\nPress for success - but give no quarter\nBoth managers had praised their opponent's style of play in the build-up and it was no surprise when the game began at a high tempo with both sides attacking freely.\nBut Bournemouth showed more steel than the side who lost 5-1 to a Harry Kane-inspired Spurs this time last year, with Arter particularly relishing the physical battle, epitomised by a perfectly timed tackle - hard but fair - on Victor Wanyama.\nWhile Tottenham shaded possession, the frenzied nature of the game and the visitors' determination to stop Bournemouth counter-attacking at pace saw Lamela, Vertonghen, Alli and Rose all enter Pawson's notebook before half-time for fouls.\nLamela was perhaps fortunate not to receive a second caution before the break for a challenge no better than those that had earned earlier bookings - minutes after he had struck the bar with a curling shot.\nMeanwhile, television replays did not show Spurs' Sissoko in a good light as he clashed with an incensed Arter on the touchline and appeared to throw an elbow.\nAn England audition?\nWith interim England boss Gareth Southgate in the stands, it was Alli and Wilshere - potential rivals for the central attacking midfield role - who were at the heart of the most threatening moves.\nAlli tested Boruc from long range early in the second half, with the big Pole diving right to palm the ball away - but the 20-year-old only lasted 71 minutes before being withdrawn.\nWilshere, closely shadowed by the towering Wanyama while having every touch booed by the away fans for his Arsenal connections, found space to cross for Callum Wilson who headed wide.\nThe 24-year-old completed 90 minutes in the Premier League for the first time since 13 September 2014.\nMeanwhile, Rose - one of four English full-backs whose buccaneering play must have impressed Southgate - was first wasteful after being set up by Christian Eriksen, skewing his shot across goal, and then foiled by Boruc after trying a low shot with 15 minutes left.\nMan of the match - Harry Arter (Bournemouth)\nWhat they said:\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I am more proud of the players today than after winning 6-1 last week against Hull. We went toe to toe with an outstanding team and it was a game of real quality. We did not deserve to lose it, we had good moments too. We managed to nullify most of their threat.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"If we want to be contenders, we need to win games like these.\n\"It was a very competitive game, they were ready to compete and it was tough. We managed the whole game, but if you don't score it is difficult to win. We fought loads and it is one point more and a clean sheet.\"\nThe stats you need to know:\nTottenham have now gone unbeaten in their opening nine top-flight games of a season for the fourth time in their history (also 1959-60, 1960-61 and 1990-91).\nBournemouth have kept as many clean sheets in their past four home Premier League games (three) as they did in their previous 17 matches combined.\nMidfielder Andrew Surman, who pulled out of the starting line-up with illness after the warm-up, had started the Cherries' previous 86 league games, and been on the pitch for every minute of every Bournemouth Premier League match until this one.\nSpurs are the only side yet to concede from open play in the Premier League this season.\nTottenham were shown more yellow cards against Bournemouth (four) than in any other Premier League game this season.\nThe Cherries have yet to win a Premier League game at home against a side from London (drawn two, lost four).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth take the long trip up north to face Middlesbrough in the league next Saturday (kick-off 15:00 BST), while Tottenham host champions Leicester at the same time."

When they did have a sight of goal they lacked conviction.\nSanchez tested former Barcelona team-mate Valdes from 20 yards but should have done much better with one from half that distance.\nThey mustered a final set of attacks in the closing moments and had the ball in the net when Ozil poked in, but the German was clearly offside.\nBoro impress in north London\nFinding goals was Middlesbrough's problem coming into this game having scored only seven in the league.\nLoan signing Negredo netted on the opening day of the season but has been off-key since. At the Emirates he should have beaten Cech with a low shot and then, with moments remaining, he allowed Laurent Koscielny to tackle him in the area.\nBoth Gaston Ramirez and in particular Traore impressed in midfield, with Karanka's counter-attacking plan suiting the pacy Spaniard, who twice threatened with runs from his own area.\nOne of those ended with a shot that Cech had to push away and another saw him play in Negredo for that late chance. The 20-year-old also had another strike saved by the Gunners keeper in the first half.\nIf Boro build on this display and start finding the net then they might avoid a relegation battle at the end of the season.\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Middlesbrough)\nAnalysis\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day:\n\"It was a brilliant team performance by Middlesbrough but Adama Traore gave them a threat on the break. He's strong, demands the ball and is comfortable in possession.\n\"Middlesbrough made some good chances and he was at the centre of everything they did well in the game. He kept up that intensity throughout.\n\"He was the one player on the pitch who looked as if he could win the game and he deserved to be on the winning side.\"\nFormer Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on Match of the Day:\n\"I was pleasantly surprised with Victor Valdes. He had one of his best games for Middlesbrough so far.\n\"He has been out injured but he came out and dominated his area which is a surprise, I've never seen him do that before.\n\"You didn't expect Petr Cech to be the busier goalkeeper of the two. He is the best goalkeeper in the league and has been for five years.\n\"I have had the privilege of working with him [at Chelsea] and class him as a good mate. He stayed big and kept Arsenal in the match, which was quite strange.\"\nManager reaction\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"It is a game where you had a lot of possession but there were tired legs and you are prone to counter-attacks. You make it difficult for yourself - 75% possession but you could have lost the game, that is modern football.\n\"When you are not sharp, you lack creativity in the final third. The energy levels were a bit down but we were intelligent enough not to lose it.\n\"We were exposed at times. When you cannot win, you must not lose.\n\"They had chances but our goalkeeper saved us today. Cech had a good performance in decisive phases.\n\"At least you can have a drink on your birthday. When you win you deserve it, when you don't you need it.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"It was an amazing performance from my team especially after the last defeat at home.\n\"For me, it is good if you come here and their best player is Cech.\n\"We have to keep going, keep working and we have shown we can compete with the best teams in the Premier League.\n\"I said I did not want to panic the boys but they have quality players and we have to defend. We were organised, the transition was good and this team and fans deserve to live these moments.\n\"Every single game in the Premier League is important. It is good to enjoy it for a few hours but it will be back to work tomorrow for the Bournemouth game. We need as many points as possible.\n\"We have to grow, we have to learn for experience. Once again, adding this kind of point and to see this team performance is pleasing.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal have won just one of their past seven Premier League meetings with Middlesbrough (five draws, one defeat).\nMiddlesbrough kept their first Premier League clean sheet in London since a 1-0 win at Crystal Palace in April 2005 (23 games without one).\nWenger's side failed to score in a home Premier League match for the first time since February (0-0 v Southampton).\nMiddlesbrough had more shots than their opponents for only the second time in the Premier League this season, though have failed to win either game (also v Watford).\nNo team has kept more Premier League clean sheets than Arsenal in 2016 (14, level with Leicester).\nIt was the third time Wenger took charge of a Premier League game on his birthday, but the first time he failed to win (1-0 v Man City in 2005 and 4-0 v Reading in 2006).\nWhat's next?\nArsenal face Reading in the EFL Cup on Tuesday before they travel to Sunderland next Saturday for a 12:30 BST encounter.

        "article_text": "Burnley 2-1 Everton\nScott Arfield's 90th-minute winner gave Burnley their third win of the season in a match dominated by Everton at Turf Moor.\nIt had looked like Yannick Bolasie's first Everton goal had earned his side a point before Arfield fired home after Johann Berg Gudmundsson's fierce shot rebounded off the crossbar.\nKevin Mirallas nearly gave the visitors an early lead but an error by Everton keeper Maarten Stekelenburg allowed Sam Vokes to poke Burnley in front.\nBolasie stole the ball off team-mate Romelu Lukaku before firing across home keeper Tom Heaton to equalise.\nLukaku was twice close to making it 2-1 to the Toffees but Michael Keane and Heaton both made crucial clearances with the Belgium striker ready to pounce.\nIt is Everton's second league defeat under manager Ronald Koeman.\nRelive Burnley's win over Everton here\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League football here\nHow did Everton lose that?\nIt was an astonishing finish as Everton had totally dominated after equalising and appeared the only side likely to force a winner.\nThe Toffees' main downfall was that, after a bright opening, they failed to make the most of their dominance, despite a shot count of 20 to nine in their favour.\nMidfielder Ross Barkley was recalled to the side after being dropped at Manchester City last Saturday and tested Heaton with a fierce drive, but Burnley's centre-half partnership of Ben Mee and Michael Keane was tough to break down after a first-minute mix-up allowed Mirallas a clear opening.\nConceding late winners was a habit of Everton's under previous manager Roberto Martinez last season and the Toffees can only hope this defeat is not part of a pattern. After starting the season with a draw and five wins, they are now winless in their past five games, losing three of them.\nArfield in the thick of the action\nAll of Burnley's 10 points so far this season have been won at Turf Moor and their home form is going to be crucial if they are to stay up.\nMidfielder Arfield's strike was the Clarets' first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League, having previously been relegated from the top flight in 2009-10 and 2014-15.\nThe Canada international, who was raised in Scotland, was prominent throughout this match. After picking up an early booking, he had to be spoken to by referee Mike Jones having committed another foul.\nLate in the first half, the 27-year-old burst through and had a shot that Stekelenburg could only parry into Vokes' path for the opening goal with the keeper, who saved two penalties at Manchester City last Saturday, seemingly late getting down to the ball.\nThere was nothing Stekelenburg could do about the winner with Arfield well positioned to smash left-footed into the far corner and spark bedlam in the stands.\nMan of the match - Scott Arfield (Burnley)\nWhat they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche told BBC Sport: \"It was a good performance, a very authentic performance. We went away from what we're good at in the match at Southampton I thought, and we had to remind our players we build on the basics here.\n\"We know we have to work for everything we get and I thought that was on show today. The two goals, though, they were both real quality.\n\"We go to take the game on and give a performance, that was the key thing. We know if we get that right we've got a chance of getting something.\n\"This is a difficult place to come. We've made it that way over the last few years, and we want it to continue of course.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \"It is hard to take because sometimes football can be so unfair. We did not deserve to lose. We did so many good things but finally the result is not what we want.\n\"We started well, maybe we dropped a bit for the last 20 minutes of the first half. We played well in the second half, we had a good reaction and had enough chances to score.\n\"Burnley were very well organised and dropped back, it was difficult but I thought we played well in that time. To travel back without any points is really very disappointing. It's one of those days when you cannot believe you lost the game.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day:\n\"Everton manager Ronald Koeman will be a little concerned by not winning in four league matches, but most coaches look at performance and the performance was much better than it has been in recent weeks. If Everton keep playing like this, they will be fine. They have lots of pace and creativity and they were unlucky.\"\nFormer Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on Match of the Day:\n\"I thought Tom Heaton made some good saves and was very busy throughout the game. He is their leader, their captain. It is his second season in the Premier League and you can see that he has grown in confidence and now Burnley are reaping the rewards.\n\"It is important he does well if they are to have any chance of staying in the league. He is the most improved goalkeeper in the Premier League and his experience with the national team has done him good.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nBurnley have scored in all of their past 19 home league games against Everton, their third longest current run (Aston Villa 35, Fulham 24)\nScott Arfield's goal was his first in the Premier League since 10 January 2015, when he netted in a 2-1 win against QPR at Turf Moor\nSean Dyche's side haven't conceded more than once in any of their past 19 league games at Turf Moor, since a 0-2 defeat against Preston in December 2015\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Old Trafford to take on Manchester United next Saturday (15:00 BST), while Everton host West Ham on Sunday, 30 October (13:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 3-1 Crystal Palace\nLeicester stretched their unbeaten home run to 20 league games as the Foxes followed up their midweek Champions League win with victory over Crystal Palace.\nSummer signing Ahmed Musa scored his first goal for the club, while Shinji Okazaki and Christian Fuchs struck after the break - the latter's effort a superb volley - to secure a convincing win.\nYohan Cabaye scored a consolation for the Londoners and Palace pressurised the hosts in the final five minutes as they attempted an unlikely comeback.\nBut it was too late against a Leicester side who showed something of the form that won them the title last season, even without England striker Jamie Vardy in the starting line-up.\nVardy, who played in the 1-0 win over Copenhagen and has not scored in eight games, was rested with manager Claudio Ranieri saying he needed to rotate his players as they juggle European and league commitments.\nThe Italian's decision was justified as Okazaki added guile to the Leicester attack, while Islam Slimani was a menacing presence up front.\nLeicester play to their strengths\nLeicester are one victory away from the Champions League knockout stages after making it three wins from three in their group with victory over Copenhagen on Tuesday, but their Premier League form has been less satisfying - they have already lost one league fixture more than in the entirety of last season.\nBut this victory will give Foxes fans confidence their team can cope with the rigours of Champions League and Premier League football.\nIt is not that the defending champions have suffered European 'hangovers' this season - they have picked up seven points in the league after their three Champions League games.\nIt is in matches leading up to European nights - all away from home - that they have suffered, although the three defeats that have preceded their Champions League wins did come against Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea.\nRanieri was criticised for resting players during last week's 3-0 thumping by Chelsea, leaving Riyad Mahrez and Slimani out of the starting line-up at Stamford Bridge. This week it was Vardy who stepped down, but he was not missed as others starred in what was the Foxes' best league performance of the season.\nThe hosts attacked with pace, with Musa, Okazaki and Mahrez in particular giving Palace problems. The opener by the lively Musa was deserved, with the Nigerian's manager saying the winger is now \"ready\" for the Premier League.\nOkazaki also caught the eye, doubling Leicester's advantage by drilling Damien Delaney's clearance in at the near post for his first goal in 14 appearances.\nFuchs' volley across goal was the icing on the cake, however, as the full-back - who extended his contract with the club this week - gave Steve Mandanda no hope in the Palace goal. \"I just hit it as hard as I could,\" said the Austrian.\nPositives for Palace\nPalace manager Alan Pardew talked this week of creating a legacy at Selhurst Park, and specifically of qualifying for Europe, but back-to-back league defeats will knock confidence.\nYet there are positives for Pardew to take in defeat.\nHis team fought until the final whistle, ending the match with 23 shots - six more than Leicester - and edged their opponents in possession and territory.\nWilfried Zaha was bright throughout, assisting the returning Cabaye as he beat both Andy King and Fuchs on the right wing, but unfortunately for Palace Andros Townsend on the opposite wing had a quiet match.\nThe match could have unfolded differently had Christian Benteke's header hit the back of the net instead of the crossbar in the first half with the score goalless, but once the visitors fell two goals behind defeat seemed the only likely outcome as the Foxes thrived on the counter-attack.\nMan of the Match - Shinji Okazaki (Leicester City)\nWhat the managers said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I feel good. For the first 20 minutes I felt not so good but after that we started to play our pressing, fast football against a very good team.\n\"That was our best performance so far this season. It was the shape and model of last season and we concentrated on doing our job. We knew our weaknesses but also strengths.\n\"This was not a game for Jamie Vardy just like last game was not a game for Riyad Mahrez. I want to rotate my players and now everybody is ready to fight for their place on the pitch.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"The scoreline wasn't a fair reflection. We had a great start, hit the bar and that could have changed the course of the game.\n\"But then they cranked it up for the last 20 minutes of the first half and we struggled to hold on to them.\n\"The second half we had loads of chances but failed to capitalise. We were OK but their pace and power were too much for us at the end. They are champions for a reason.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester City (W13 D7) are one game away from matching the longest unbeaten home run in the top flight since Chelsea's 21-game streak which ended in August 2015.\nChristian Fuchs scored his first goal for Leicester City in his 47th appearance for the club.\nCrystal Palace are just the fifth Premier League side to score against Leicester at home in their past 16 games at the King Power Stadium.\nShinji Okazaki scored his first goal in 14 Premier League games, last doing so against Newcastle in March.\nCrystal Palace have conceded in their past 15 Premier League away games, their longest run on the road in the Premier League without a clean sheet.\nWhat's next?\nLeicester's next match will be at White Hart Lane against Tottenham on 29 October. They will then travel to Denmark to face FC Copenhagen on 2 November in the Champions League, where victory would ensure their progress to the knockout stages.\nPalace have a less hectic schedule, but their next league match is also a tough test, at home against Liverpool on 29 October."

It should be given offside. The referee thinks it is onside.\n\"You can tell by the referee's movement to the linesman that he is not sure, they weren't sure but it was not a goal.\n\"I thought the players played well. Not in the opening 20 minutes, they bossed us but we got through it and had good chances. I am very pleased with the performance but not the result.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was a dramatic end. The first 25 minutes it was by far our best 25 minutes, including last season.\n\"We were good, sharp, created chances and we deserved to be two up. Then they came back. And in the second half they had great chances and were dangerous on the counter attack but in the last 15 minutes we pushed more and we were looking to score.\n\"I cannot say it was a goal from the training ground. You expect Winston Reid to score a header but it was a great decision to come in on the edge of the box.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy:\n\"David Moyes thought the winner should have been ruled out for offside - and it was tight. But ultimately if you're conceding lots of goals late in games, you have got a problem.\n\"Players switched off and were not concentrating. As Winston Reid hits it, you can see Jonathan Calleri is in line with Jack Rodwell. It's an inch or two inches but it's not a bad decision. I think the assistant referee has done well.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Ham are back at the London Stadium in EFL Cup action on Wednesday, when they host rivals Chelsea. Slaven Bilic's side then visit Everton in the Premier League for the 13:30 BST kick-off on Sunday.\nSunderland go to Southampton in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, before Arsenal visit the Stadium of Light in the Premier League's early kick-off on Saturday."

Stoke trio Shaqiri, Phil Bardsley and Joe Allen were then all booked after the final whistle.\nStoke's first away victory of the season also brings them back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since March - and moves them to 16th place on nine points.\nHull, meanwhile, have conceded 19 goals in their past five league games and are without a league win since 20 August.\nMagic Shaqiri\nShaqiri's goals were two moments of magic in a match largely unmemorable otherwise.\nThe 25-year-old's past four Premier League goals have all come from outside the box and his two against Hull were his first since the opening day of the season.\nHis first came from his own corner, which was cleared by Hull as far as Ryan Shawcross, who passed the ball back to Shaqiri.\nThe former Bayern Munich winger then cut inside before unleashing a curling 25-yard shot, which left David Marshall no chance in the Hull goal.\nHe then won the free-kick for his second on 49 minutes and stepped up to send the ball over the wall and into the bottom right corner, beyond Marshall.\nShaqiri also created wonderful chances for Marko Arnautovic and Wilfried Bony, having three shots in all and making five key passes in the match.\n'Shaqiri can open up defences from anywhere'\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day:\n\"Xherdan Shaqiri hasn't done enough of this in a Stoke shirt. He was outstanding. He had that strut around him and produced moments of brilliance. His first goal was unstoppable.\n\"He's got the ability to open up defences from anywhere on the pitch - not many players can do that. If he can stay fit, along with Joe Allen and Marko Arnautovic, then Stoke will be up the table before you know it.\"\nHull's decline continues\nThe optimism of Hull's wins in the first two games of the season has faded at the KCOM Stadium, where plenty of empty seats could be seen among a crowd of only 18,522.\nThe hosts did not manage a shot on target until Abel Hernandez came on after 55 minutes.\nTheir best attacking efforts came with the game already won for Stoke and the home side still struggled in front of goal despite their late burst.\nStoke dominated the midfield, with Shaqiri and Arnautovic given too much space.\nHull also had returning captain Michael Dawson to thank for some crucial tackles. Playing in his first game of the season after a knee injury the 32-year-old stopped Bony and Shaqiri from scoring in the first half.\nPhelan, upgraded from his caretaker role nine days ago, is yet to taste victory since and will have his work cut out to address the slide in form - something not helped by Robert Snodgrass limping off with an ankle injury late on.\nMan of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri\nWhat they said:\nHull boss Mike Phelan: \"We were edgy and we gave the ball away too easily. There are lessons to be learned by all of us.\n\"We are under no illusions and we shouldn't be. We need to rebuild confidence and set our sights for the battle ahead. We need to do more. We are not here to lie down and let teams beat us.\n\"Robert Snodgrass got stood on - he's got a bruised ankle and we will assess that in the morning.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"Xherdan Shaqiri missed some games but since he came back he's been really positive and we are really pleased with him.\n\"We have been playing well for a number of weeks. We are building performances. From start to finish we were in control.\n\"People questioned us at the beginning but now we are allowing people to see our level.\n\"I didn't see what happened after full-time - there were afters from both sides.\"\nThe stats you need to know:\nStoke kept their first clean sheet away from home since December 2015.\nHull have lost four successive home Premier League games for the first time in a single Premier League season.\nStoke are unbeaten in four Premier League games (won two, drawn two), their best run since March.\nHull have conceded 19 goals in their last five Premier League games, as many as in their previous 16 in the competition.\nShaqiri is the first Stoke player to score two goals from outside the box in a Premier League game.\nWhat's next?\nHull travel to Championship side Bristol City in the fourth round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday before a trip to Watford on Saturday.\nStoke host Swansea on Monday 31 October."

They have won 37, drawn 33 and lost 30 of their 100 home games in the competition.\nWhat they said\nSwansea City manager Bob Bradley told BBC Sport: \"The second half was strong and we came out right from the beginning looking for a goal. It didn't happen but there are a lot of positives.\n\"It was important to get a clean sheet and the play from our centre halves was solid as Deeney and Ighalo are difficult to play against. This is a step we can build on.\n\"I think the team we picked today made sense. There is disappointment for sure, but a shared feeling of an all-round good effort.\"\nWatford boss Walter Mazzarri told BBC Sport: \"The first half was the best we have played and how I want my team to play. We have to be more aggressive in the last 25 metres.\n\"I tend to not comment on the referees, but today there were two very clear penalties for us. Those decisions are the ones that meant we did not go away with the three points.\n\"I was very happy with the performance because today we played in a very smooth way, we didn't throw long balls, we played from the defence and I liked it, they are doing what I have said.\"\nWhat next?\nWatford entertain Hull City in the Premier League on Saturday, 29 October, with Swansea playing an away game at Stoke two days later."

Anything other than a Liverpool victory would have been a injustice.\nWest Brom have only scored 10 goals in nine Premier League matches, with Saido Berahino a constant issue for Pulis.\nThe 23-year-old striker, who got 20 goals in all competitions back in 2014-15, has only netted one Premier League goal in 2016 and been placed on a fitness programme after being \"eight pounds over his ideal weight\".\nYet again, he was not included in West Brom's 18-man squad, but they need their striker back fit with the right attitude quickly. Salomon Rondon struggled to get in the game and Robson-Kanu is yet to score since joining the Baggies in September.\nCan Liverpool last the pace in the Premier League title race?\nJurgen Klopp has been in charge of Liverpool for just over a year and created an attacking side that is pleasing on the eye and a squad that could challenge for the Premier League title.\nThey only finished eighth last season, but do not have the distraction of European football this year and have made a fantastic start, despite a tough run of games.\nIn their nine league matches in 2016-17, they have played four of the current top seven - Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United - as well as defending champions Leicester.\nThey now have what appears to be, on paper at least, a favourable run of fixtures, with their next seven matches against sides all outside of the top seven.\nOne major concern for Klopp would be their inability to kill off this game, and the late goal they conceded means they have have kept just one clean sheet in their last 11 Premier League games.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 12 home Premier League games (won seven, drawn five), their longest run since a sequence of 14 in April 2014.\nSince Jurgen Klopp's first game in charge, there have been more Premier League goals netted in games involving Liverpool than any other team (126 - 75 for, 51 against).\nRoberto Firmino has had a hand in 17 Premier League goals (12 goals, five assists) in 2016; more than any other Liverpool player.\nSadio Mane has both scored and assisted in two of his four Premier League appearances at Anfield this season.\n70% of West Brom's Premier League goals this season have come via set-pieces (including penalties) - seven of 10 goals.\nIndeed, West Brom have scored more Premier League goals from corners this season than any other team (five).\nGareth McAuley is the only West Brom defender to hit double figures for Premier League goals (11).\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I am happy with the performance of my team. It is difficult against West Brom, so many balls in the air and they are so dangerous from set pieces.\n\"It would have been a joke if we had drawn today, it was unbelievable how we played. It was a good performance against a team like this. They were here to get something, but we never let them back into the game.\n\"Their corners kicks are so good, I had a feeling that 15 players in white kit were in the box. It was a big, big challenge to stay cool, stay concentrated. It is a really nice team I am really happy to have these boys around.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"In the first half we were OK, just two poor mistakes. It is quality at times when we get the ball, to get in their final third.\n\"In the second half we had a go, it opened up at our end and Ben made some wonderful saves. We made changes, freshened it up and caused them problems.\n\"You know if you get a goal it puts them on the back foot and it is a shame it didn't come earlier.\n\"We lack certain qualities we are looking for. The squad has improved, they have faults and we accept that but they worked hard today.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: \"Coutinho is the jewel in the crown for Liverpool. He is special in so many ways, now he is adding that end product.\n\"He has scored four (league) goals this season, he only scored eight last season. He's playing with confidence and his decision making is much better than it was before.\n\"He's dictating games, he's frightening the opposition. His performance was absolutely magnificent. Long may it continue.\"\nFormer Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on Match of the Day: \"Liverpool's defending from set pieces is one of their Achilles' heels. They are playing with a zonal marking system and as a player I hated it.\n\"They do not have players on the posts at corners and it just makes it more difficult. As a goalkeeper, you feel more exposed.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool are back in action on Tuesday when they entertain Tottenham in the fourth round of the EFL Cup, before they play away at Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Saturday.\nFor West Brom, they have a week without a match before taking on Manchester City at home in the Premier League on Saturday, 29 October."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-1 Southampton\nManchester City returned to the top of the Premier League despite seeing their winless streak extend to a fifth game as Southampton earned a deserved draw.\nThe visitors led when John Stones' sloppy pass allowed Nathan Redmond to round Claudio Bravo and slot in.\nCity improved after being booed off by some home fans at the break, equalising when half-time substitute Kelechi Iheanacho prodded in Leroy Sane's low cross.\nPep Guardiola's side controlled the second half as they searched for a winner, but Saints keeper Fraser Forster produced splendid saves to deny Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva.\nCity's inability to grab a second goal means ex-Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola has failed to win in five successive matches for only the second time in his managerial career.\nHowever, the point was still enough to lift the Blues back above Arsenal and Liverpool to the Premier League summit.\nSouthampton stay eighth after extending their unbeaten league run to a fifth game.\nRelive the action from Etihad Stadium\nCity stutter... again\nCity's recent struggles are barely believable after the swaggering start they made to the season, when they won all of Guardiola's opening 10 matches.\nThe former Spain international had been forced to defend his tactics following Wednesday's 4-0 Champions League defeat at his former club Barcelona, which came after their first loss of the season at Tottenham and the subsequent home draw against Everton.\nBut there were signs of the home support becoming frustrated with his team's build-from-the-back approach, not least when many could be heard jeering their team off at the break after Stones' error.\nCity lacked aggression and tempo in the opening 45 minutes, allowing an organised Southampton side to contain them and then burst forward on the break.\nGuardiola had to act - and he did that decisively at the break.\nOff came Kevin de Bruyne - City's stand-out performer this season - with young striker Iheanacho introduced in his place.\nAs a result, City had much more purpose and drive, typified by the desire showed by Iheanacho to beat Saints defender Virgil van Dijk to Sane's cross and prod in the equaliser.\nStones not quite rolling\nStones is the only player to feature in every match of Guardiola's reign following his \u00a347.5m summer move from Everton, impressing his new manager with his composure and ability to play out comfortably from the back.\nBut critics have argued the England international is guilty of over-playing, leaving himself open to making mistakes. They were proved right on both counts when he gifted Southampton the lead.\nAfter receiving the ball just outside his own area, Stones tried to pass inside to returning skipper Vincent Kompany - instead playing it behind his captain and straight to Redmond.\nThe 22-year-old thought he had redeemed himself five minutes later, guiding in De Bruyne's curling free-kick with a far-post volley - but it was ruled out for offside and instead his impact on this game will be remembered for the wrong reasons.\nStones has now made four errors leading to goals since the start of last season - more than any other outfield Premier League player.\nAnalysis: Why have Man City paid \u00a347.5m for Stones?\nSaints go marching on\nSouthampton arrived at a sunny Etihad Stadium with the intention of ending a miserable record of six successive defeats at the ground.\nArguably this was their greatest opportunity in recent seasons, having showed they were starting to click under new manager Claude Puel while City had been toiling.\nThe Frenchman saw his side earn just two points in his first four games after replacing Ronald Koeman, but any doubts about his appointment appear to have been curtailed by a rich vein of form.\nSaints were compact and organised defensively, while not afraid to use the pace of Redmond and Dusan Tadic on the break.\nTrue, their goal was gifted to them and they also managed just one other shot on target - but despite not creating many chances, they did threaten to stretch City on a number of occasions and deserved a point for their work-rate and commitment alone.\nMan of the match - Oriol Romeu (Southampton)\nPost-match reaction\nCity manager Pep Guardiola: \"The second half was much better. The first half wasn't really good. Of course our mistake was bad. The way I want to play is not to pass to the striker.\nOn the second-half recovery: \"They did it for themselves in the second half. They changed the game, I didn't change the game. We did think we were going to win it, but Southampton didn't make it easy. They have good defenders and are good at everything.\nOn the displays in the winless last five games: \"We have to analyse what is the situation. In the period, apart from at White Hart Lane against Tottenham [losing 2-0] it's been good. Against Everton and Barcelona - when it was 11 v 11 - the displays were as good as those in the first 10 games.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel:\n\"We can be satisfied with this point, we played against a good team and it was important to keep a good structure. We took our chances to score and after we defended well.\n\"My players played just two days ago in the Europa League, they were tired, but showed good spirit and organisation.\n\"Against fantastic players it was good to take a point and not disappointing. It was hard to defend at the end of the game but I am very satisfied.\"\nStats of the day\nGuardiola is winless in five games as a manager for the first time since March 2009.\nIheanacho has now netted 11 goals from 17 shots on target in his Premier League career.\nManchester City had just three shots on target against Southampton - their fewest in a game under Guardiola.\nSergio Aguero has gone three Premier League games without a goal for the first time since December 2015.\nOriol Romeu made eight tackles against Manchester City, the most by a Southampton player in a Premier League game this season.\nWhat's next?\nThe not-so small matter of a Manchester derby for City. The Blues aim to end their winless run when they visit United in the EFL Cup fourth round on Wednesday (20:00 BST).\nSouthampton are also in midweek cup action, hosting top-flight rivals Sunderland on Wednesday (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 4-0 Manchester United\nJose Mourinho was humiliated on his return to Chelsea as his former club blew away his Manchester United side at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Blues, who sacked Mourinho for a second time last year, led after just 30 seconds when Pedro capitalised on slack defending to roll in.\nGary Cahill smashed in the second after United allowed Eden Hazard's corner to bounce in their box.\nUnited offered little sign of making a comeback, falling further behind when Hazard drilled in a precise 15-yard strike.\nN'Golo Kante skipped around a static defence to slot in and seal victory as Chelsea moved within a point of Premier League leaders Manchester City.\nThe comprehensive win lifted the Blues above Tottenham into fourth, with just one point separating the top five.\nUnited stay seventh as the gap between them and the early pacesetters widens to six points, with almost a quarter of the season gone.\nAnalysis: Why it is too early to write Man Utd off\nRelive how Chelsea ruined Mourinho's return\n'You're not special anymore!'\nMourinho was making his first return to Stamford Bridge since he was sacked in December 2015, leaving when the defending champions were 16th in the Premier League.\nThe Portuguese boss said before the match he was unsure - and also unconcerned - about the reception he would be given by the home fans.\nUnsurprisingly, for a man who delivered seven trophies in his two spells at the club, it turned out to be largely positive.\nHundreds gathered to greet Mourinho as he walked off the United team bus, while he received a warm embrace from former skipper John Terry before kick-off.\nThat is where the Blues' hospitality ended. Instead, it was his United team who provided the generosity.\nAnd the home fans could not resist a cheeky dig at their former boss - chanting \"you're not special anymore\" to the self-proclaimed Special One.\nUnited exposed by defensive horror show\nMourinho said before the game he would not \"celebrate like a crazy kid\" if his new team scored at Stamford Bridge.\nUnfortunately for him, there was little sign of that resolve being put to the test as Chelsea capitalised on his side's defensive deficiencies.\nUnited were ragged at the back, ripped open by Pedro's opener without even having a touch and left flapping from then on.\nAnd the severity of the scoreline was emphasised by some startling statistics:\nIt was the heaviest defeat for Jose Mourinho in all competitions since Real Madrid's 5-0 defeat by Barcelona in November 2010.\nUnited suffered their heaviest Premier League defeat since the 6-1 loss against Manchester City in October 2011.\nThe Red Devils lost a Premier League away match by four or more goals for the first time since 1999 - also at Chelsea.\nThe tone was set when Chris Smalling hesitated in dealing with a long ball, allowing Pedro to nip in and round David de Gea - and United never recovered.\nThe basic ability to defend a set-piece eluded them for Chelsea's second, two deflected touches helping the ball on to the unmarked Cahill, who lashed in.\nUnited, without the injured Wayne Rooney, looked unrecognisable from the side that dug in to keep a clean sheet at Anfield on Monday. They looked unrecognisable from any Mourinho side, always expected to be well organised and difficult to break down.\nA stony-faced Mourinho watched his static defenders allow Hazard and then Kante to skip into space and score after the break, leaving new Chelsea manager Antonio Conte lapping up the acclaim of a home crowd revelling in their former boss's misfortune.\n\"We made incredible defensive mistakes,\" said Mourinho. \"And then you pay for that.\"\nConte starting to shine\nFormer Italy manager Antonio Conte was tasked with restoring Chelsea's fortunes after a chastening season, which started under Mourinho's leadership and ended in the defending champions finishing 10th.\nConte's start has not been smooth, however.\nBack-to-back league defeats against Liverpool and Arsenal last month led to some criticism, forcing him to laugh off rumours of his imminent sacking.\nBut, after making a tactical switch to a 3-4-3 formation following those defeats, Conte has seen his team flourish.\nThree successive victories have pushed the Blues back among the frontrunners, with the Stamford Bridge crowd showing their appreciation for the new manager as he urged them to make more noise during the second half.\n\"It is important for the manager to find the right solution for your team,\" said Conte on his team's recent revival.\n\"It was not a good situation when Chelsea conceded in every game - we change and now we are playing good football.\"\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nPost-match reaction\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte:\n\"We made a fantastic start. We scored the early goal but we continued to play good football, intensity and possession, create many chances. Today we didn't concede, which was important. It was a type of win that increases the confidence.\n\"We wanted to show our ambition and give the satisfaction to our fans and show last season was very bad.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho:\n\"You come with a strategy, you cannot concede a goal in the way we did.\n\"We were coming to have an offensive approach. We wanted to create chances; we showed that after the 1-0. The second and the third were counter-attack goals.\n\"It is one of those days when you give the advantage to opponents by doing nothing.\n\"In terms of points, we got zero points, we lose three points. We are six points from the top, three from the top four, we now need to win matches. We need to win our matches now, which are not easy.\n\"We need to win to close that gap - after these last three matches, we made two out of nine. We now need points.\"\nWhat's next?\nNext comes the not-so-small matter of midweek derby matches for both teams.\nChelsea travel across London to face West Ham in the EFL Cup fourth round on Wednesday (19:45 BST), while Manchester United host neighbours City at Old Trafford in the same competition on the same day (20:00 BST).\n(More) stats you need to know\nChelsea have gone eight league games - winning four and drawing four - without losing against Manchester United, their best run against the Red Devils in their history.\nPedro scored the fastest goal in the Premier League this season, finding the net after 30 seconds.\nHe was also booked after 59 seconds for his celebration, the quickest yellow this season in the Premier League.\nThis was only the sixth time Manchester United had conceded in the opening minute of a Premier League game. Gus Poyet, Jason Euell, Marlon Harewood, Jermain Defoe and Edin Dzeko were the other scorers.\nOnly twice before had Jose Mourinho seen his side concede inside the first minute - both to Southampton while at Chelsea (James Beattie in 2004 and Jay Rodriguez in 2013).\nManchester United have only collected fewer points from their first nine games of a Premier League season once before - in 2014-15 when they collected 13.\nEden Hazard has equalled his goal tally from last season in the Premier League - four - in just nine games."

This is a team that are supposed to be battling to stay in this league even this early in the season, but if they continue to play this deep, with this much fear, then they have got no chance.\"\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\nMatch of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said: \"Arsenal are a better team with Alexis Sanchez as a centre forward.

The players are doing their best, but you will only ever be judged by your results.\"\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"It was a mental test when we were at 1-1. We missed so many chances, so many opportunities, and I was worried we could lose - but we have shown great strength to bounce back.\n\"In the Premier League at 1-1 you can lose the game but it was about how we responded. Do we panic, give up, feel sorry for ourselves? We responded well and in the end it was a comfortable win.\n\"It was an important result for us. We had six wins, then one draw at home, which was disappointing, and a second draw or defeat would have been like we had dropped our level.\"\nOn his introduction of Giroud, who then scored twice in the next seven minutes, Wenger added: \"The manager has an easy credit when he has quality players on the bench and you don't need to be a special manager to make this decision. It was 1-1 and we had Giroud on the bench.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nSunderland have managed just two points from their opening 10 games (goal difference -13), the worst start ever to a Premier League season (Manchester City also had two points in 1995-96 but had a superior goal difference).\nThis is Sunderland's worst start to a league season after 10 games in any division.\nArsenal have lost just one of their past 20 top-flight games (12 wins and seven draws)\nAlexis Sanchez has been directly involved in eight goals in his past eight Premier League appearances (five goals, three assists).\nWhat next?\nArsenal travel to Bulgaria to play Ludogorets Razgrad in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 19:45 GMT before hosting north London rivals Tottenham in the Premier League on 6 November (12:00 kick-off).\nSunderland are at Bournemouth in the Premier League at 15:00 on 5 November."

        "article_text": "Man Utd 0-0 Burnley\nManchester United had manager Jose Mourinho and midfielder Ander Herrera sent off as they failed to break down Burnley and lost more ground on the pacesetters at the top of the Premier League.\nOn a fractious afternoon at Old Trafford, United were left frustrated by a series of unsuccessful penalty appeals, a string of saves by inspired Clarets keeper Tom Heaton and the woodwork.\nMourinho, who was incensed when Jon Flanagan was not punished for a challenge on Matteo Darmian inside the Burnley box, paid the price for allowing his frustration to boil over at half-time.\nHe sat in the main stand behind the dugout at the start of the second half but was quickly moved to the directors' box, with a go-between running up and down the stairs to pass on his instructions to his assistants.\nMourinho still doesn't know his best XI - Lawrenson\nHerrera got his marching orders in the 68th minute, with referee Mark Clattenburg showing him a second yellow card for a challenge on Dean Marney, although the United player appeared to slip as he made the tackle.\nThat eased some of the pressure on Burnley, who had needed an inspired performance from Heaton to keep United at bay.\nThe former United keeper made a string of spectacular stops, with the pick of them being a Peter Schmeichel-style scissor save that saw him spread himself brilliantly at the back post to keep out a Zlatan Ibrahimovic volley.\nWhen Heaton was beaten, United's frustrations continued with Juan Mata's shot hitting the outside of a post and Ibrahimovic's looping header coming back off the bar. They had 37 efforts at goal in total but none were successful.\nUnited have won only one of their last seven league games and are now eight points behind Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool, who all won on Saturday.\nZlatan still cannot find the target\nZlatan Ibrahimovic had more shots - 12 - than any other player against the Clarets but his fruitless run in front of goal continued.\nNothing summed up his current form more than the late chance he spurned when Paul Pogba found him unmarked at the back post, but he failed to find the target with the goal gaping.\nThe 35-year-old Swede has had more shots than any other Premier League player this season, with 57 in 10 games, but he has not scored in this competition in six games since his goal against Manchester City on 10 September, his worst run since his time with Inter Milan in 2007.\nHe has managed a goal in the Europa League but his record in all competitions is not much better, with just one goal in his last 10 games. The correlation between his form and United's is surely no coincidence.\nBurnley are hard to break down\nHeaton was the standout performer and he will rightly make the headlines with his saves.\nBut Burnley's whole team deserve credit for their defensive efforts in holding out against a siege that continued even when they faced 10 men.\nThe Clarets rarely threatened at the other end, with Johann Berg Gudmundsson's first-half strike their only effort to bring a save out of David de Gea.\nThey have only managed a total of four shots in their four away league games to date, but that statistic matters a lot less when they mount a rearguard action like this.\nMan of the Match - Burnley's Tom Heaton\nOnly one candidate. The pocket of Clarets fans at Old Trafford chanted \"England's number one\" throughout the game in recognition of a brilliant performance by their goalkeeper.\nThe stats you need to know\nManchester United had 37 shots in this match, their most in a Premier League game since 2003-04 (when Opta records began).\nAnder Herrera was shown his first red card in the Premier League, having been sent off five times in La Liga.\nThe last time Manchester United were shown a red card at Old Trafford at home in the Premier League was in September 2014 (Wayne Rooney v West Ham).\nTom Heaton made 11 saves in this game, the joint-most by a keeper in a Premier League game this season (also Heaton v Southampton).\nZlatan Ibrahimovic has gone six league games without scoring for the first time since December 2007 with Inter Milan.\nIbrahimovic had 12 shots in this game, the most by a player in a Premier League match since Robin van Persie for Arsenal in December 2011 (v Wolves).\nManchester United have won just one of their last seven Premier League games (drew three, lost three).\nBurnley had lost their previous three away games this season prior to today.\nThe Clarets have managed just four shots on target in four away games this season.\nWhat next?\nUnited travel to Turkey to take on Fenerbahce in the Europa League on Thursday, then go to Wales to play Swansea on Sunday in their next Premier League game. Burnley are at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday."

I've got a depressed dressing room after the efforts and the work they put into the game. It's cruel. If it is a worldy then you can hold hands up.\n\"We were competitive enough in the game, we created probably the best chances in the game, but were are on the end of another defeat. We have to react to that and I am sure we will do next week.\n\"When I think about it we could have done better at defending. It is a cruel one, it flashed across the box and hit someone on the leg and has gone in. It could have gone anywhere.\n\"To win a football match, you have to score goals and try and get that from forward play and forwards. Everyone has to weigh-in with goals and at the moment it is not happening. We have to keep positive, on the front foot and I'm sure it will change.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"We played well in the first half an hour. We deserved to lead. We had patience on the counter-attack and finally scored, the victory is deserved.\n\"They defended well, we knew they would defend. We were unlucky, we should have scored at the beginning.\n\"I am very happy with how the team is playing now, giving me satisfaction. With how they are playing on the pitch, we deserve two or three points more at this stage.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nDawson scored his first Premier League own-goal since December 2006, when playing for Tottenham against Charlton.\nThe Hornets are now unbeaten in four top-flight games, their best unbeaten run since December 2015.\nWatford have kept three successive clean sheets for the first time since last December in the Premier League."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Leicester City\nLeicester City earned their first away point in the Premier League this season as Ahmed Musa levelled to secure a deserved draw for the defending champions at Tottenham.\nVincent Janssen gave the hosts the lead at White Hart Lane, scoring his first Premier League goal from the penalty spot after Robert Huth had felled the striker.\nSpurs twice hit the crossbar - Dele Alli in the first half and Jan Vertonghen after the break - but had to settle for the draw as Musa caught them sleeping at the beginning of the second half.\nLeicester had lost all four of their previous away games this season - for a goal difference of -10 - but they battled well and frustrated a Tottenham side lacking a cutting edge in attack.\nThe north Londoners, still unbeaten in the league this season, have now drawn a third successive league game and find themselves three points behind league leaders Manchester City, who beat West Brom 4-0.\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nTottenham missing Kane\nTottenham were still without injured influential defender Toby Alderweireld, while midfielder Eric Lamela was ruled out through illness, but the player whose presence they missed most was Harry Kane.\nManager Mauricio Pochettino included both Son Heung-min, scorer of four goals this season, and \u00a317m summer signing Janssen in his starting line-up, but Spurs are not the same side in the final third without the England international's dynamism and ruthlessness as the lone striker.\nIt was difficult not to wonder what Kane, sidelined since September with an ankle injury, would have done with Christian Eriksen's cross at the near post two yards from goal after Janssen mistimed his shot and swept the ball across the face of the goal.\nJanssen did score from the spot, as he also did in the EFL Cup defeat by Liverpool in midweek, and had chances to add to his tally - heading an Eriksen cross wide, then turning Huth adroitly and shooting a fraction off target.\nThe Netherlands international, who scored 27 times in the Eredivisie last season, did not play badly - Pochettino said after the match he was happy with his striker's performance - but he is yet to match the standards Kane has set.\nPochettino will surely hope this will be his team's final match without Kane, with the Argentine saying last season's top scorer could return for next week's derby against Arsenal.\n\"I know Harry Kane makes a huge difference. But what they did last season was stretch teams,\" said Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer. \"They are not doing that at the moment and the pace in the final third is not as sharp as it could be.\n\"They have to get their sharpness back into the game and ask more questions of the back four.\"\nLeicester's away day blues ended\nLeicester's form away from the King Power Stadium has been poor this season, although three of their defeats were at Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea.\nTottenham dominated, in the first half especially, and ended the match having enjoyed 63% of possession. Understandably, Pochettino said at full-time that he was disappointed with the result.\nBut while the Foxes recorded a total of just three shots in the match - with only Musa's close-range equaliser from a Jamie Vardy cross on target - their success in stifling a Tottenham side who have now gone five games without victory deserved a point.\nIndeed, the champions are the only side to score against Pochettino's men in open play this season and questions could be raised about referee Robert Madley's decision to award Tottenham a penalty.\nManager Claudio Ranieri is likely also to be pleased that he could once again shuffle his forward line - starting with Vardy, who was a substitute in last week's victory over Crystal Palace, instead of record signing Islan Slimani with one eye on the Champions League.\nMan of the match - Danny Rose (Tottenham)\nThe stats you need to know\nAll three of Vincent Janssen's goals for Spurs have come from the penalty spot.\nRobert Huth gave away a penalty in the Premier League for the first time since January 2013.\nAhmed Musa has scored in back-to-back Premier League games, after failing to score in his first five league games at Leicester.\nJamie Vardy has as many assists in the Premier League this season as he has goals (both two).\nSpurs have avoided defeat in their first 10 league games for the first time since 1990-91.\nMauricio Pochettino's side have lost only once in their past 13 home games in the Premier League (eight wins, four draws).\nWhat next?\nTottenham face Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Wednesday before a Premier League match at Arsenal on 6 November.\nLeicester travel to Copenhagen on Tuesday (19:45 GMT kick-off) where victory will guarantee their progress to the Champions League knockout stages. They will then aim to extend their unbeaten home run in the league to 21 matches as West Brom visit on 6 November.\nWhat the managers said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"Disappointed. We created chances. We dominated the game. But I am disappointed with the way we conceded the goal. It's hard to lose two points.\n\"I was disappointed for the goal as the way we conceded was a little unlucky. I am happy with the performance.\n\"We are still strong and unbeaten in the league, that is very important. It's true we are fighting and it's difficult to win games recently but the team showed it is strong enough.\"\nOn Vincent Janssen scoring: \"I am very happy with him. Since the day he arrived his behaviour and performance is always improving. it's important to have confidence and trust in him.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I am pleased with a point, with our performance. I saw the Leicester spirit, the way we stuck together and fought together. A very good performance.\n\"Until now we played with a singular spirit, today was a squad spirit and the performance was outstanding.\n\"Ahmed Musa is slowly understanding the Premier League. He is a good player but he must improve again.\""

Who better, then, to set the tone at the Hawthorns?\nThe Argentina striker's first was rifled in brilliantly after his clever run was matched by Gundogan's quality pass into the space between West Brom's two centre-backs.\nHis second was spectacular, but equally simple. McAuley and Jonas Olsson both should have cleared a loose ball on the edge of the box but hesitated, allowing the 28-year-old to set himself up and smash home.\nThat was his seventh league goal of the season - the joint best return with Chelsea's Diego Costa - and ends a spell of six matches without a goal.\nBut don't forget Gundogan\nWest Brom's players were obviously deflated by Aguero's two goals in nine minutes, so Pulis deserves credit for managing to galvanise his side into producing a spirited second-half display.\nThey might have got themselves back in it when Rondon miscued his finish when meeting James McClean's excellent cross, and Claudio Bravo almost gifted the Venezuela striker a goal when he rashly came to clear and left his goal exposed, but Rondon's header bounced just wide.\nBut City managed to ride out the pressure and always looked dangerous on the break, with Aguero hugely influential in driving forward on the counter-attack.\nHe was in search of the hat-trick, but it was Gundogan who expertly slid the ball past Ben Foster to end the Baggies' revival - meeting Aguero's fantastic dinked pass through the back line.\nThe 26-year-old Germany midfielder was excellent throughout, and his first-time finish for City's fourth capped his best performance since joining from Borussia Dortmund this summer.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"When we lose there are always doubts. Also in the second half I had doubts when we didn't play too well.\n\"I had doubts and saw what we had to improve. It's the first time I have not won in six games. Always you have doubts. Not over the principles.\n\"We need Sergio. We know how important he is for us when he can convince us how good he is and how important he is for this club.\n\"I am going to help him to be much, much better. That is my target.\n\"I'm so, so happy for him because with all of that he is one of the nicest people I have met.\n\"He is part of the history for this club. He is one of the best.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"In the first half we sat back waiting for it to happen. In the second half we gave it a go but needed to score. As the game opens up they have real quality on the break.\n\"I'm disappointed with all the goals. We should do better. You look at the money they have spent and their quality and depth is absolutely frightening.\"\nStats of the day\nWest Brom have lost their past 10 Premier League games against Manchester City, conceding 28 goals in the process.\nSergio Aguero has scored seven times in nine league games against West Brom.\nAguero has also scored six goals in his past four Premier League away games.\nCity have kept a clean sheet in eight of their past 13 league meetings with West Brom, and conceded just one goal in the past four meetings.\nThe Baggies have had just two shots on target in their past 180 minutes of action in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City's next game is at home to Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45 GMT kick-off). They next play in the league at home to Middlesbrough in a 15:00 kick-off on Saturday.\nWest Brom's next match is away to Leicester in a 16:30 kick-off in the Premier League on 6 November."

That was a big win and will give us a lot of confidence.\"\nCherries struggle on the road\nBournemouth, now without a win in their past seven away league games, started promisingly as King had a shot cleared off the line by Adam Clayton and then hit the crossbar with a volley.\nHowever, the visitors failed to match the intensity levels shown in last week's draw with Tottenham.\nStriker Benik Afobe made a difference after his introduction - he was refused a penalty following a Ben Gibson challenge and looped a late header on to the crossbar - but Bournemouth could not prevent a first league defeat in five outings.\nMan of the match - Gaston Ramirez\nWhat they said:\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"Our last three games have been really good and we had to show everybody we could compete, especially at home.\n\"With this performance and commitment of everybody, I think we are going the right way.\n\"The team showed we are really good when we are together.

They stretch teams and their attackers all chip in and are difficult to contain.\n\"The number of chances they create is because of the energy they have. They remind me of the Newcastle team 20 years ago, Kevin Keegan's side of Beardsley, Ferdinand, Asprilla and Ginola. The one thing that needs to improve is the defence.\"\nWhat the managers said\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"The first half was difficult on the sideline. We talked about putting them under pressure but in the first period we did not start well.\n\"We worked hard and defended well but we should have put more pressure on Liverpool. But they are a good team. Two set plays though, that is not us.\n\"We have to tighten up on that area. Our centre-backs are good but they got done. It is something we have to work on.\n\"In the second half, the game hinged on key moments. There were some penalty decisions which I thought were tight. We had a tight one last season with the same referee.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"In the first 15 minutes we were not really at 100% then in half an hour we created chance after chance. It was a close game and a deserved win at the end. I'm a very happy man.\n\"The defensive error we made for the first goal is because we are not at the limit of our concentration. The aggressiveness was not there at the start of the game. But I saw a lot of wonderful things offensively.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLiverpool scored four or more goals in a Premier League game for the eighth time in 2016\nThe Reds have now netted 79 league goals since Jurgen Klopp took charge - at least three more than any other team in the competition\nPalace are one of only two teams to have conceded in every Premier League match this season, along with bottom club Sunderland\nJames McArthur is the second Palace player to score two headers in the same Premier League game, after Glenn Murray against West Ham in 2015\nJordan Henderson made eight tackles against Crystal Palace, the most by a Liverpool player in a league game this season\nWhat next\nLiverpool will aim to make it three league victories on the trot when they host Watford on 6 November, while Crystal Palace travel to Burnley, a team equal with them on 11 points in the table, on 5 November."

Maybe the first half was not what we expect if we play at home. Maybe because of the last few results we didn't have belief and confidence, and that was the difference between the first and second half.\"\nKoeman on Barkley: \"That's how he needs to play. He worked very hard, he was running, and that's what you need to do. He had some shots on target, scored the second goal, and that's what we want to see from midfield.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"While you are always not happy after a defeat, I am more disappointed because we could have taken something from this game.\n\"I'm not saying that they didn't deserve it, because they were more mature, but we should have done better.\n\"They were more lethal and more cruel when they were offered something from us. We didn't capitalise on our chances.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLukaku has scored in his past seven Premier League games against West Ham - only Robin van Persie (eight versus Stoke) has had a longer run.\nLukaku has had a hand in 10 Premier League goals against West Ham (seven goals, three assists).\nKoeman is only the third Everton manager to remain unbeaten in his opening five home Premier League games (also Mike Walker and Roberto Martinez).\nWest Ham have now conceded in their past 17 Premier League games against Everton, their joint-longest run without a clean sheet in the competition.\nBarkley has been involved in 19 Premier League goals since the start of last season (10 goals, nine assists). The only English midfielders with more are Dele Alli (22) and James Milner (21).\nBilic's side have lost four of their five Premier League away games this season, just one fewer than they lost in the whole of last term.\nWhat next?\nEverton, sixth in the table, will play Chelsea in the league on 5 November, while West Ham host fellow strugglers Stoke on the same day."

He has already scored five goals and looks like he has regained the confidence to tease and torment defenders.\nHe showed skill and power with his goal at St Mary's, scoring in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time, then provided the pass from which Costa added Chelsea's second.\nItalian feel about Chelsea\nChelsea were exposed defensively in consecutive league defeats by Liverpool and Arsenal this season but, since then, they have kept four clean sheets and scored 11 goals.\nManager Antonio Conte's move to a formation with three centre-backs is helping his side look more secure at the back and threatening in attack.\nThe Italian also appears to have implemented the sort of defending for which his country is famous, as an organised Chelsea denied Southampton's players any space in or around the penalty area and closed them down with aggression throughout.\n\"We've worked hard in training,\" said Chelsea defender Gary Cahill. \"We've worked hard on the shape that the manager has brought and we are getting the rewards.\n\"It's OK having the shape but it's about having the mentality of the players to go out and dig in and do the business when you need to.\"\nSouthampton undone by Chelsea again\nSouthampton, whose most recent defeat at home in the league came against Chelsea in February, again had little answer to the Blues.\nSaints had 55 shots on target this season before the game, but could muster only one on Sunday despite enjoying 55% of possession.\nTheir sole effort was Dusan Tadic's low effort, which was comfortably palmed wide by keeper Thibaut Courtois.\nSouthampton's chances were fleeting and, when they did come, striker Charlie Austin put one header wide and another high.\n'Austin has proved doubters wrong this season'\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\n'It's the perfect game' - what they said\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"We played very well in the first half with so many possibilities and good play.\n\"But it's difficult to play against this team when you concede a goal after a few minutes. They can play their game with a strong defence and counter-attack.\n\"It was difficult to find solutions. It's a disappointment because we tried to play good football. We can do better.\"\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"We knew today was a test against a strong side in good shape and form. It's important to win games like this - people can increase their confidence and will to work and trust in the work.\n\"We created many chances. It's the perfect game when strikers score and defenders don't concede. The players deserved this; they work hard in training.\n\"When you see this type of game and commitment from your players, it's fantastic for a coach.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nChelsea have exactly double the number of points (22) that they had after 10 games last season (11)\nDiego Costa has reached 40 Premier League goals in 64 games, the sixth fastest player to do so and seven games faster than it took Manchester City's Sergio Aguero\nChelsea have kept four consecutive Premier League clean sheets for the first time since August 2010 (a run of six)\nThe Blues have won more away Premier League games than any other side in 2016 (9) - in the same time, they have won only five home matches\nSouthampton have kept only one clean sheet in their past 11 home Premier League games (1-0 v Swansea)\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton are at home to Inter Milan for a 20:05 GMT kick-off on Thursday, 3 November before a league game at Hull City at 14:15 on Sunday, 6 November.\nChelsea host Everton in the 17:30 kick-off on Saturday, 5 November."

It was written in the stars and it happens so often. He and Joe Allen have been excellent since they came here.\n\"Joe Allen is an outstanding footballer. He has that knack of anticipating where the ball is going to land and that is why I have pushed him further forwards.\"\nSwansea boss Bob Bradley: \"We had some good stretches but, overall, we lack confidence and in key moments we were second best.\n\"There is no easy solution to getting confidence back. When you are going through a bad stretch you have to have belief. It was 1-1 at half-time but we didn't start the second half in a way that suggested we could win the game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nStoke scored three goals in a Premier League match for the first time since February (vs Bournemouth), while they have netted two or more goals in three straight league games for the first time since November 2010.\nSwansea have lost four consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since their first four games on the road in the competition in 2011.\nAllen has four goals and two assists in 10 Premier League games this season - his joint-best haul in a single Premier League season (also four goals and two assists in 2011-12).\nRoutledge's goal was his first headed goal in the Premier League.\nHughes' side hit the woodwork three times in the first half - the most by one side in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game since Tottenham v Blackburn in April 2012.\nWhat next?\nStoke face a trip to West Ham for a 15:00 GMT kick-off on Saturday, 5 November, while Swansea are at home to Manchester United at 15:00 GMT a day later."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-2 Sunderland\nTen-man Sunderland recorded their first league win of the season as Jermain Defoe's second-half penalty handed them victory against Bournemouth.\nIt was a remarkable result for the Black Cats, who continually soaked up pressure from their opponents and found themselves a man down when Steven Pienaar was sent off in the 59th minute.\nThe Cherries took an 11th-minute lead when Dan Gosling converted Adam Smith's cross from close range for his third goal of the season.\nThe Black Cats lost 4-1 at home to Arsenal last week and once again looked vulnerable at the back, with Junior Stanislas and Joshua King both going close after the opener. But they surprisingly drew level in the 33rd minute when Victor Anichebe smacked his six-yard shot high past the reach of keeper Artur Boruc.\nSunderland began the second half well but were dealt a huge blow when Pienaar was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on Stanislas.\nDespite being a man down, David Moyes' side still pressed and were rewarded with a spot-kick when Anichebe was fouled by Adam Smith in the area. Defoe converted against his former team as his current side hung on for a morale-boosting win.\nRelive the action from the Vitality Stadium\nAll the reaction from Saturday's other Premier League games\nSunderland spirit earns deserved win\nThis match looked like a home-win banker, more so after Gosling used his stomach to give Eddie Howe's side the lead.\nThe visitors' defence, which had conceded three against Everton and Palace and four against the Gunners, looked set for another uncomfortable day.\nMoyes started with a 4-4-2 formation, but changed to 4-5-1 after going behind to stem the flow of Bournemouth's attacks from the wings. It worked and gave Sunderland the chance to focus on troubling the home side.\nThe change in tactic paid off as Defoe, playing deeper, fed Anichebe in the area. The striker used his 6ft 3in physique to hold off his marker, turn and then crack a shot past Pickford to equalise. That was the former Everton player's first Premier League goal since scoring for West Brom against Newcastle in May 2015 - 546 days ago.\nMoyes - watching from the stands as he served a suspension - must have thought the footballing gods were not on his side when Pienaar was deservedly sent off with 31 minutes remaining.\nBut the spirit that had drawn Sunderland level was again present when they drove forward and Anichebe, once again tussling in the area, fell under the challenge of Smith. Some might have deemed it a weak challenge but Mike Dean pointed to the spot and Defoe dispatched the ball high into Boruc's net.\nHow did Bournemouth manage to lose?\nThe Cherries had only lost one game at home this season and it appeared highly unlikely that Saturday's contest would result in a second, as they fired in 22 shots and enjoyed 70% of possession.\nBut they found Sunderland keeper Jordan Pickford, 22, in exceptional form. The England Under-21 keeper made great saves to deny Jack Wilshere and Joshua King. Junior Stanislas also saw a sidefoot shot come off the post and substitute striker Benik Afobe, who has not scored since March, twice screwed good opportunities wide.\nFor manager Eddie Howe it must have been a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, with another North-East club, Newcastle, surviving a similar onslaught during the 2015 Guy Fawkes weekend to come away with their first win of the season. Of course, they were eventually relegated.\nMan of the match - Victor Anichebe (Sunderland)\n\"It was about the shift Anichebe put in,\" Match of the Day pundit Jermaine Jenas said.\n\"He was playing with a cracked rib at one point so no-one can question his desire and he is just so strong.\n\"He was a real asset for Sunderland because they were under so much pressure but he was a great focal point for them to hold up the ball.\"\nManager reaction\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"Anichebe was terrific today. He has an awful lot going for him and his all-round performance was terrific. He got an injury early on - he thought he broke his rib.\"\nOn the second yellow card shown to Steven Pienaar: \"At the time I thought there was nothing in the tackle, I thought he got the ball, but now I can see why it can be given.\n\"It is only one win. We need two, we need to just keep picking up the points. Hopefully it will show people there is a great spirit and commitment among the players and desire to do well.\n\"We went to a factory this week, showing the players it is much better to be a footballer than working in a factory.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"In the last two games we've had some gilt-edged chances. We scored six against Hull, but it's frustrating when you have a hatful of chances and can't put them away.\n\"We should have gone 2-0 ahead as we had chances in the first half which we didn't put away. You feel the red card would swing the game back in our favour, we battered their goal for the next 15 minutes and that's when we needed to find the killer touch, but we didn't. We left the back door open and conceded what was a poor goal for us.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nMoyes has won his first Premier League game since a victory against Newcastle in April 2014 - 945 days ago.\nSunderland enjoyed their first win in their last 12 Premier League games (3-0 v Everton on May 11th 2016).\nWilshere made his 100th Premier League start today, over six-and-a-half years since his first (Feb 2010 for Bolton v Man City).\nSmith has provided more assists this season than any other Premier League defender (3).\nAnichebe became only the third player to score a goal this season for Sunderland in the top-flight - also Jermain Defoe (6) and Patrick van Aanholt (2).\nPienaar has been sent off four times in the Premier League, all while playing under David Moyes (3 for Everton, 1 for Sunderland).\nDefoe has netted 11 away goals in the Premier League in 2016, a haul bettered only by Sergio Aguero with 15 (Harry Kane also has 11).\nDefoe has scored against 35 of the 38 Premier League clubs he has faced.\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Sunderland are at home to fellow strugglers Hull on 19 November and Bournemouth are away at Stoke on the same day. Both are 15:00 GMT kick offs."

Palace - with Zaha to the fore - piled on the pressure in injury time but again the hosts broke with pace and purpose, Barnes releasing Berg Gudmundsson and then scampering into the box to apply a powerful finish to the return pass.\nA harsh defeat for Pardew's Eagles\nAfter such a thrilling contest it was a shame there had to be a loser.\nPalace contributed hugely throughout, with winger Zaha impressing with purposeful runs down both flanks in front of the watching interim England manager Gareth Southgate.\nTime and again Zaha terrorised Burnley full-backs Lowton and Jon Flanagan, and it was his trickery down the right that allowed substitute Wickham to put Palace back in the match.\nThey fully deserved their equaliser when it came from Benteke's spot-kick, at which point they looked set to emulate the heroics on their last league visit to Turf Moor in January 2015, when they came from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nBut it was not to be. Barnes' late goal saw to that, before Townsend's shot in the fifth minute of injury time cannoned off the post to cruelly set the seal on Palace's fate.\nMan of the match - Johann Berg Gudmundsson\nThe stats you need to know\nBurnley have won back-to-back Premier League home games for the first time since October 2009\nCrystal Palace have gone 16 Premier League games without a clean sheet, the longest run without a shut-out of any current top-flight side\nSam Vokes has scored and assisted in the same league game for the first time since January 2008 for Bournemouth v Port Vale\nVokes has netted two of the three fastest Premier League goals this season (78 secs v Crystal Palace, 97 secs v Liverpool), with Pedro netting the quickest (30 secs for Chelsea v Man Utd)\nAshley Barnes scored his first goal in his last 23 league appearances, since netting v West Brom in February 2015\nManager reaction\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"I think we deserved the points by the final whistle. It was a real ding-dong of a game. Both teams went at it and I've been really pleased with the mentality of the group to finish in such a good way.\n\"I thought we played with confidence, although at 2-0 we were a little bit nervy, and I was happy with the fantastic finish from Ashley Barnes.\n\"It's fantastic to be ninth in the table for a club like Burnley. There are questions asked of us in the Premier League but we're enjoying the ride.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"We've made errors for the goals but played well and it frustrates me to say that. It's daft mistakes which have cost us. I think we got carried away at 2-2 and over committed at a set play and it cost us.\n\"This defeat is a big blow for us because we have some tough games coming up. We're going to have to be strong after the international break and get some results. We dominated and actually played some good football today.\n\"We don't look like a team that has lost four games, it's been fine margins.

It was a move that produced similarly quick results as the West Ham defence was finally breached.\nAdrian did not cover himself in glory, coming a long way out of his goal in a failed bid to stop a Walters cross from which Bojan, making only his seventh appearance in 2016-17, scored his second goal of the season.\n\"We went a bit more direct as we felt there was an opportunity there,\" said Hughes. \"[Bojan has] been a bit frustrated as he hasn't had a lot of game time of late but he showed his quality.\"\nAre West Ham settling at London Stadium?\nThe Hammers were playing their first game at their new home since the crowd trouble that marred their EFL Cup win over Chelsea.\nThe match appeared to pass without any incident as West Ham went four games unbeaten in all competitions at London Stadium.\nHowever, Bilic's side have yet to hit the heights of last season and are nine points worse off than at the same stage of the 2015-16 campaign.\nAlthough they improved after the break following a poor first half, they still lacked a cutting edge and managed only two shots on target compared with Stoke's four.\nOnly Hull City (13) have had fewer shots on target at home this season than West Ham (14).\nWest Ham's frustration at not being able to hold on for the three points will be heightened with tough-looking league fixtures against Tottenham, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool coming up next.\nMan of the match - Pedro Obiang\nWhat they said:\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"It's a frustrating result but it's a fair result.

The home side managed 19 attempts on the Boro goal in the opening 45 minutes, but only six in the second half as they let the away side back in.\nThere was sloppy play in midfield, silly fouls that allowed the balance of play to turn at crucial moments, and then - after Aguero and De Bruyne's bad misses - slack defending in injury time.\nIn the Premier League, City have drawn each of their past three home games 1-1, are without a home win since September, and have now lost their place at the top of the table.\nChelsea's 5-0 victory over Everton means they lead City by one point, and Guardiola's side could slip a further point behind in the title race if Arsenal beat Tottenham or Liverpool beat Watford on Sunday.\nBoro's repeat performance\nTwo weeks ago, Aitor Karanka's side put in brilliant defensive display at Arsenal to earn a point from a match they might even have won with some better finishing.\nHere, luck had a greater role in keeping City at bay until just before the break - and some solid close-range stops by Valdes.\nAguero, Ilkay Gundogan and De Bruyne were all denied as the home side failed to take advantage of Boro's inability to keep the ball and their risky play at the back.\nBut in the second half they were a team transformed.\nNegredo's attempt to score from almost inside his own half spoke of a greater sense of confidence within the side, and Boro continued to snatch chances from City's 71% share of possession.\nBravo smothered the ball at Adam Forshaw's feet to stop one counter, and Stewart Downing should have done better with his finish on another.\nEven though they had to wait until injury time for the goal to come, and even though they rode their luck, Boro deserved their point.\nLast year's Championship runners-up are now unbeaten in three matches, and move up to 14th in the table.\nThe stats you need to know\nCity have drawn three consecutive home Premier League matches for the first time since November 2009 under Mark Hughes.\nThey have failed to keep a clean sheet in nine of their 11 league matches this season.\nAguero has scored against 28 of the 30 different sides he has faced in the Premier League.\nSince his debut in September 2015, De Bruyne has provided 19 assists for Man City in all competitions; six more than any other City player.\nMiddlesbrough have won just one of their last 19 Premier League away games (D5 L13).\nWhat they said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We did absolutely everything to win the game, controlled the game and in the last minute we concede a goal. It is a pity.\n\"We have to close the game with a second or third goal and we couldn't do that. We created six or seven chances and didn't score.\"\nOn Sergio Aguero's second-half miss at 1-0: \"When you miss you have to accept that, but the league is still long. It is a miss because we have dropped six points in the last three home games but we are still there. We have to move forward.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"It was an amazing result. In the first half we went on to the pitch with too much respect for them.\n\"I told them at half-time we weren't just there to defend and that we could play like we did in the second half. I was pleased with our performance.\n\"Two weeks ago at Arsenal was more difficult than today because Arsenal didn't score and we were organised. Our reaction was really good and it is a big step to showing how good we are.\"\nMan of the match - Marten de Roon (Middlesbrough)\nHe made some excellent interceptions in midfield, crowded out the influential Fernandinho, and drove in Boro's equaliser at the death.\nHis phone was alight with messages of congratulations in the post-match interview but he did manage to say: \"I saw the little Spaniard come in - City sub Aleix Garcia - and knew I could get above him. The cross had so much power on it, it couldn't be stopped.\n\"I ran straight into the fans and I didn't know what was happening in my head. I never score, it was full happiness.\"\nAnalysis\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport at Etihad Stadium\nYou can adjust statistics to suit any argument but one win in five Premier League games is not a great return, even if the win was by four goals and - during that run - you have beaten Barcelona for the first time.\nBy the end of this weekend, City could be in fourth, their lowest position since the opening day of the season.\nNot that Middlesbrough's determination should be overlooked. It wasn't pretty at times but they found a way to stay in the game when they could easily have been blown away.\nBBC Match of the Day commentator Guy Mowbray\nThat's the most exciting finish I've seen in a Premier League game this season. The look on Marten de Roon's face was priceless - he was overjoyed and bewildered at the same time.\nFormer England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live\nBoro worked hard and you get your rewards. For all of their possession, City looked sluggish in the second half.\nThey dominated the game but seemed to run out of legs in the second half.\nBoro carved out one glorious chance towards the end of the game and it's a fantastic header from Marten de Roon.\nFormer Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright on BBC Match Of The Day\nManchester City dominated a game again but they just didn't get the luck or take their chances. They created some good opportunities - Aguero, Silva and De Bruyne all got into good positions but it just didn't happen for them.\nYou could see from the faces of the City players as they came off the pitch they were very disappointed. Middlesbrough were terrible in the first half but they tried to get forward more in the second and put City under pressure. At 1-0 you are always in the game.\nWhat's next?\nCity play away at Crystal Palace on Saturday, 19 November, after the international break.\nMiddlesbrough are at home to Chelsea on Sunday, 20 November."

Those that remained applauded Chelsea off the pitch, with the biggest ovation of all from the home fans reserved for Hazard, who capped a brilliant display with two superb goals.\nRelive Chelsea's emphatic win over Everton\nConte hails Hazard as \"complete\" player\nChelsea system stands up to scrutiny\nIn an attempt to stifle the 3-4-3 system that had earned Antonio Conte's side four consecutive Premier League wins before this match, Everton manager Ronald Koeman reverted to three men at the back.\nHowever, the tactical ploy proved ineffective as the Dutchman's side were outpassed and outclassed by Conte's men in a mesmerising first-half display.\nConfidence has been high among Chelsea's players since their 4-0 demolition of Manchester United last month, and the swagger with which they dismantled Everton will only further fuel talk of a title challenge.\nIn the five games since the formation change, Conte's side have scored 16 goals and conceded none.\nChelsea look a completely different team from the sluggish outfit that struggled under Jose Mourinho last season, and this performance was a real statement of intent.\nFrustrated Lukaku draws a blank\nEverton striker Romelu Lukaku would have been desperate to impress against former club Chelsea, but the Belgium international was a subdued presence.\nLuakaku, who joined Everton from Chelsea for a club record \u00a328m in July 2014, was barely able to get on the ball in the final third as Chelsea dominated.\nDespite being paired with Yannick Bolasie, he was deprived of service, and spent large parts of the game chasing lost causes.\nThe 23-year-old has now played five Premier League matches for the Toffees against his former club, but is yet to score.\nHazard back to his brilliant best\nIf Lukaku endured a frustrating game, the opposite was true for compatriot Hazard, who has rediscovered his joie de vivre and scored for a fourth consecutive league game.\nChelsea striker Diego Costa may have had a hand in more goals than any other Premier League player, with nine goals and three assists, but it is Hazard who has supporters on their feet whenever he is on the ball.\nThe effortless manner with which he glided past the dazed yellow shirts of Everton's defence for his two goals was breathtaking.\nConte claimed the 25-year-old forward is on the right track to becoming one of the world's best players, and on this evidence that is no exaggeration.\nBBC Match Of The Day pundit Ian Wright said: \"Eden Hazard was world class against Everton. I think Ronald Koeman picked the wrong day to pick three at the back.\"\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"It was a great game, a good performance. It is important for confidence to be top of the league. We have to continue as Everton is now in the past.\n\"The players deserve this because they show me great commitment and I can tell they are working very hard. The team has more balance defensively, but we don't lose our offensive situation. We are creating more chances to score goals.\n\"Eden Hazard played an impressive game. We all know he is a talented player. I see he is working a lot for the team and his team-mates are very happy for this. He must continue - he is showing his talent in every game.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"The difference was too big between Chelsea and Everton. The one positive thing is it is only three points.\n\"This system is very difficult to play against and really the Chelsea manager has brought a winning mentality to the players. They are hungry and they will fight for the title for sure.\n\"I expected more from my team. It was a big difference in every aspect. It was not about the system - the difference was the mentality to win the game. With five defenders we control it, after 2-0 it was over.\"\nThe stats you need know\nChelsea have won five of their six Premier League home games this season, as many as they managed in the whole of the 2015/16 season.\nThere were 23 passes in the build-up for Eden Hazard's second goal, the most before a goal in the Premier League this season.\nEverton have conceded five or more goals in a Premier League game for the first time since shipping six against Chelsea in August 2014.\nChelsea stopped a team from a having a shot in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time since January 2013 against Reading.\nIt was the first time Hazard has scored two or more at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League since February 2014.\nDiego Costa has had a hand in more goals than any other Premier League player this season (9 goals, 3 assists).\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break, Chelsea face Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on Sunday, 20 November with a 16:00 GMT kick-off, while a day earlier Everton have a 15:00 GMT home fixture against struggling Swansea."

They then threatened to take all three points, Christian Eriksen forcing a fine save from Petr Cech before his angled free-kick bounced back off the post in the closing minutes.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily Podcast\nRelive Arsenal v Tottenham\nArsenal miss their chance?\nArsenal could have gone top of the Premier League with victory here - moving ahead of Chelsea and Manchester City - and all the omens seemed good for them.\nThe Gunners were in prime form - they remain unbeaten since the opening day of the season - and faced a Spurs side in reduced circumstances, without a win in six games and missing the influence of injured defender Toby Alderweireld and midfielder Dele Alli.\nWith Kane also returning after a seven-week absence, Arsenal would have entered this north London derby high on optimism - yet had to settle for a draw.\nArsenal were pushed on to the back foot for the first 20 minutes but then exerted their authority to lead by half-time, only to be knocked off track by the concession of that cheap penalty.\nThe Gunners still showed plenty of grit but in the end they did not possess enough guile to unlock a resolute Spurs defence, who held out in relative comfort for a point.\nPochettino will be more satisfied than Wenger\nIt may seem strange to suggest, but spirits appeared low at Spurs despite the fact they entered this game as the only unbeaten team left in the Premier League.\nSpurs were on an indifferent run after a superb 2-0 win against Manchester City in early October, and their Champions League campaign is in real danger of fizzling out after that second Wembley defeat in the group stage against Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday.\nThey left Emirates Stadium in better heart after a strong performance and the return of their main marksman Kane, who looked dangerous, albeit short of full match fitness.\nSpurs overcame the loss of important players to fully deserve their point and the manner in which they responded to conceding that unfortunate own goal just before half-time will have left Mauricio Pochettino more satisfied than counterpart Arsene Wenger.\nHow did Harry Kane fare?\nEngland striker Kane got a standing ovation from the visiting fans when he was replaced by Vincent Janssen after 72 minutes.\nHe proved once more that he is this team's talisman, stepping up to score coolly from the spot and showing plenty of energy considering this was his first game back.\nSpurs had played 903 minutes without Kane before this game, scoring 13 goals - five of which came against Gillingham in the EFL Cup - and while his strike was not from open play, the signs were there that they will profit from the extra menace he brings.\nHe was in a dangerous position but did not get on the end of Son Heung-min's cross in the first half and also glanced a header narrowly wide. As well his penalty, it also took a superb challenge from Arsenal defender Nacho Monreal to stop him putting Spurs ahead after the break as he stole in at the far post.\nAll in all a very satisfactory comeback.\nMan of the match - Mousa Dembele (Tottenham)\nThe stats you need to know\nArsenal v Spurs is now the highest scoring fixture in Premier League history with 139 goals.\nMauricio Pochettino is the first ever Tottenham manager to remain unbeaten in his first five top-flight north London derbies.\nHarry Kane is now Tottenham's joint-top scorer in Premier League games against Arsenal with five goals (level with Gareth Bale).\nTottenham have stayed unbeaten in their opening 11 top-flight games for the first time since 1960-61 - which is when they last won the title.\nLaurent Koscielny conceded twice as many fouls in this game (4) as he had in his previous nine Premier League games this season combined (2).\nWhat they said:\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is disappointing to drop two points at home. We created plenty of chances in dangerous situations.\n\"In the second half we looked more laboured, there were plenty of aspects I did not like, the desire was there but we were too nervous.\n\"We lacked what we are strong at; the fluency of movement, vision around the box. We usually play better from the back, there was a lot missing.\n\"Spurs go home happy, we go home and are not happy. We wanted to win the game, but overall it is not mathematically a disaster.\"\nOn the Spurs penalty: \"From the outside it looked a very soft penalty, I was surprised.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BT Sport: \"It was a strong performance from my team. Arsenal were on a good run, our players deserve full credit, they were fantastic.\n\"They played well, we created some chances to win the game, it was very competitive and good to see.\"\nOn Arsenal's opener: \"Some people say to me it is offside, it is unlucky but we showed big character, we didn't suffer, we started the second half well, deserved the penalty and scored.\"\nOn Harry Kane's return: \"I am happy with Harry Kane, it is tough after not playing for a few months,. I am happy he is back, it is important for the team to feel one of our best players is available.\"\nWhat's next?\nArsenal play away to Manchester United in a 12:30 GMT kick-off on Saturday, 19 November after the international break.\nTottenham welcome West Ham in a 17:30 GMT start later that day."

What pressure?\nAfter Manchester City slipped up at home to Middlesbrough and Arsenal were held by Tottenham, Liverpool's players knew victory would send them a point clear of Chelsea at the top of the league.\nIf there was pressure following the Blues' statement win - they defeated Everton 5-0 on Saturday - Liverpool certainly did not show any signs of suffering from it.\nRarely will the home fans have seen their side perform so dominantly. The fluid play of Coutinho, Lallana, Mane and Firmino carved out chance after chance, and while Watford were at times sloppy in possession, there was little they might have done better to resist Liverpool's 28 attempts on goal.\nWith the speed of the home side's passing and the slick interchanging of positions in attack, Watford simply could not live with Liverpool. Five different players scored in a ruthless performance full of confidence, rhythm and flair.\nSo who needs a striker?\nSturridge was without a goal in his past nine league games and, having come on to replace the excellent Lallana, the England international played as if he had a point to prove.\nBut no matter what he did, the ball just would not go in.\nTwice he struck the woodwork, once with a fierce left-footed drive that crashed against the bar as he drove in on goal from the left, later with a dipping strike from outside the box that Costel Pantilimon brilliantly tipped on to the bar.\nSturridge should then have done better when cutting on to his left and firing straight at the keeper, but Klopp will have been impressed with his forward's performance in the 20 minutes he was allowed.\nThe German was clearly very angry about one thing though - how Watford's Janmaat was allowed to ghost into the box and slot home Nordin Amrabat's pass.\nEven with his side coasting towards victory Klopp was barking instructions to his players. The message seemed to be: more pressure high up the pitch, more movement off the ball in possession. They were the key attributes in this impressive win.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\nEven though he missed what Klopp might have described as a perfect goal just before he was taken off to a standing ovation with three minutes to play, Coutinho was the outstanding performer in a stellar cast.\nThe Brazilian skied wildly over after Nathaniel Clyne launched himself into an interception on the halfway line, played a one-two with Firmino and cut back from the edge of the area.\nThat finish was lacking but of the minds and feet at work in front of the weary Watford defence, his were by far the quickest.\nThe stats you need to know\nSadio Mane has scored five goals in his five Premier League appearances at Anfield for Liverpool.\nPhilippe Coutinho has had a hand in eight goals in his past seven league appearances for Liverpool (three goals, five assists).\nRoberto Firmino has scored five times and assisted three goals in his past seven league games for Liverpool.\nWatford have conceded more goals today v Liverpool than they had in their past six PL games combined (5).\nAdam Lallana has five league assists this season, with only Kevin de Bruyne providing more (6).\nThis is Watford's joint-heaviest defeat in the Premier League, matched by a 5-0 loss to Wimbledon in December 1999.\nAnalysis\nBBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty\nLiverpool have hit the Premier League summit and there can be no doubt whatsoever - Jurgen Klopp's team are real live title contenders.\nThe fact that there were five different goalscorers in Sunday's 6-1 win against Watford at Anfield sums up the strength and potency of a Liverpool side that has hit a red hot streak since that surprise 2-0 loss at Burnley in their second game.\nSadio Mane, Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana have the pace, movement and threat to pose a danger to any side while captain Jordan Henderson has been a revelation this season.\nYes, questions remain about the quality of their defence and new goalkeeper Loris Karius but this current Liverpool teams carries a level of menace that has echoes of the Luis Suarez-inspired side that almost won the title in 2013/14.\nAnd one more factor in the title equation.\nLiverpool have already played title rivals Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea away from home, claiming seven points with victories at Emirates Stadium and Stamford Bridge. No wonder confidence is high at Anfield.\nFormer Blackburn striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live\nIt was a stunning display from Liverpool. It could have ended up double figures. They blew Watford away, and have blown away most teams this season.\nThey look like they're going to go close. The fact they have no European football and can recover between matches will help, too.\nFormer Liverpool keeper Chris Kirkland\nThere is a different feeling now at Anfield. The expectation is back and the players are proving that is justified with their performances - week in, week out.\nFormer Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage\nLiverpool, wow. The movement in those front players was incredible. They could have scored 10.\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: \"When the result gives you the impression that it is easy there is a lot of hard work behind that. The result is wonderful and the performance is terrific.\n\"But Chelsea yesterday were not bad, Manchester City against Barcelona not bad, Arsenal great movement and Tottenham - oh my god. We need to be good.\n\"Good results and performances help confidence. We will send the players all around the world and hopefully they come back healthy for the big challenge of Southampton.\n\"There is nothing to celebrate in the moment - this is our responsibility to play well when you put on the red of Liverpool. It is all good until now.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"You can lose at the home of Liverpool but we should not have lost like that.\n\"It has been a lesson for the future. This game has taught me many things, like the 2-0 defeat by Burnley.\n\"We will get better for next time and we will see a different performance after the international break.\"\nOn the injury suffered by keeper Heurelho Gomes, who was replaced by Pantilimon: \"It is his knee, but I am not sure yet [how serious]. I am not sure if it's a twist or just a knock.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool visit Southampton after the international break, on Saturday, 19 November. Watford host Leicester on the same day."

We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n\"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n\"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\"\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n\"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future.\n\"We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nJust 125 seconds separated Hull's two goals.\nRobert Snodgrass has now been directly involved in 50% of Hull's 10 goals in the Premier League this season (four goals, one assist).\nNo English player at a Premier League club has scored more goals in all competitions this season than Charlie Austin (8, level with Theo Walcott).\nThe last time the Tigers came back to win in the Premier League was in December 2014 v Sunderland.\nSaints' defeat to Hull ended a run of six successive wins against the Tigers.\nSouthampton have won just one of their last six away games in the Premier League (D2 L3).\nWhat's next?\nFollowing the international break, Hull return to action with a trip to bottom side Sunderland on Saturday, 19 November (15:00 GMT), while on the same day Southampton play host to leaders Liverpool, also at 15:00."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-3 Manchester United\nManchester United ended a run of four Premier League games without a win as they made light work of a feeble Swansea City side.\nUnited dominated from the start and were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to Paul Pogba's stunning drive and two goals for Zlatan Ibrahimovic - his first in the league since September.\nMike van der Hoorn headed in for Swansea midway through the second half but there was no real danger for the visitors, whose manager Jose Mourinho watched from the stand because of a touchline ban.\nUnited climb up to sixth in the table, while a 10th Premier League match without victory means Swansea remain second from bottom.\nThe Swans' dismal performance prompted boos from the home crowd and left manager Bob Bradley with just one point from his first four games in charge.\nBut for Mourinho, a second win in eight league matches comes as welcome relief following a difficult few weeks.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily Podcast\nRelive Sunday's football as it happened\nIbrahimovic and United back in the groove\nAlthough he was banished to the stands, Mourinho made his presence felt with six changes from Thursday's Europa League defeat at Fenerbahce.\nOne of those recalled was Ibrahimovic, whose attitude Mourinho had praised as \"brilliant\" despite a barren spell which had seen the Swede fail to score in six Premier League games.\nHappily for Ibrahimovic and United, they faced a ramshackle Swansea defence in charitable mood.\nWhile Pogba's exquisite strike would have beaten any goalkeeper, Ibrahimovic's low drive only found its way to the net because it was met with such weak resistance from Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nMourinho could sit back and relax as his side controlled the match with embarrassing ease, Pogba, Wayne Rooney and Ibrahimovic all rediscovering their form to torment their abject opponents.\nIbrahimovic's second goal was a microcosm of the match as he brushed aside Angel Rangel's untidy challenge before clipping the ball beyond Fabianski.\nFrom Brad to worse...\nIf United's sequence of four league games without victory was a worry, Swansea's winless run stretching back to the opening weekend of the season was a cause for grave concern.\nThey were thoroughly outplayed at Stoke on Monday and were even worse against United, poor in every facet of the game.\nThe atmosphere soured inside the Liberty Stadium as the hosts' defence unravelled, with the home crowd chanting \"we want our club back\" in reference to the Swans' American takeover in the summer and the subsequent disastrous results on the pitch.\nBradley's switch to a 4-4-2 formation was woefully ineffective and, after reverting to the familiar 4-2-3-1 system for the second half, Swansea improved.\nThere were faint hopes of a comeback when Van der Hoorn headed in from Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick - and things might have been different had Ibrahimovic's apparent kick at Leroy Fer been punished by more than a yellow card.\nThose were ultimately academic points, however, as Swansea limped to a sixth defeat from seven games, stumbling deeper into the relegation mire.\nMan of the match - Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)\nPost-match reaction\nSwansea manager Bob Bradley:\n\"We were pushed deep in the first half and didn't have enough time on the ball. When we did have time on the ball we weren't very sharp.\n\"They punished us with long shots. They had three shots and three goals so it was strange in that respect.\n\"The second half was better and there were some positives. But not big positives. We understand there is a lot of work to be done. We need to stay strong.\n\"I would have hoped in my earlier games to take more points. But I understand that in the Premier League you have to fight every week. The dressing room knows that - we're all on the same page.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho:\n\"We were really impressive in our control of the game. We controlled it by having a lot of the ball and hurting the opponent when we could.\n\"Credit to my defensive line - Ashley Young is not a right-back, Matteo Darmian is not a left-back, Phil Jones was a great guy to make himself available for the team even without training for months.\n\"We needed these thee points after losing two against Burnley at home. This was the best way to end the period before the internationals.\"\nManchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic on not scoring in his previous three games:\n\"I wasn't worried. As long as you create the chances, which I have been doing, the goals will come. But the most important thing is the win. The goals will come.\"\nWhat's next\nInternational duty is next up for most of the Swansea and Manchester United players.\nAfter that, United host Arsenal at Old Trafford on Saturday, 19 November (12:30 GMT), while Swansea travel to Everton later that day (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 1-2 West Bromwich Albion\nWinger Matt Phillips punished a horrendous error by midfielder Danny Drinkwater to score the winner for West Brom at champions Leicester.\nTwo goals in three second-half minutes livened up what had been a dull encounter at the King Power Stadium.\nThe Baggies scored first when midfielder James Morrison, making his first league start since January, headed in from Phillips' brilliant right-wing cross.\nMoments later Riyad Mahrez, on Leicester's right, provided a similarly accurate delivery for \u00a329m club-record signing Islam Slimani to nod in his fourth goal since joining the Foxes in the summer.\nBut with 18 minutes remaining Phillips pounced on the ball after Drinkwater miscontrolled, and strode forward before dinking his shot past keeper Ron-Robert Zieler.\nListen to 5 live's Football Daily Podcast\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nStill not clicking at Leicester\nAt this stage last season, Claudio Ranieri's side had come away from The Hawthorns with a 3-2 win that lifted them to third in the table. Over the subsequent 27 matches they only dropped points in 10 en route to a stunning Premier League title success.\nAfter 11 games this season, the Foxes have three wins and sit in 14th spot, only two points above the relegation zone.\nOn Sunday, they mustered only two efforts on target, one of which produced their goal.\nOne of the three main protagonists in Leicester's success last season who remain at the club, Mahrez, impressed against the Baggies. The other two - Jamie Vardy and Drinkwater - looked lacklustre.\nVardy came off the bench for the third time this season, and with the one chance he had he sent his eight-yard header wide. Drinkwater, Ranieri's dependable midfielder last campaign, produced a careless mistake for the West Brom winner. In total, the central midfielder lost possession 26 times, more than any player apart from the attacking Mahrez.\nThe Foxes are closing in on a spot in the Champions League knockout stages, but will this extra competition have a detrimental effect on their domestic league campaign?\nPhillips could be a great asset\nWith current Baggies top scorer Nacer Chadli missing through injury, summer signing Phillips stepped up as a more than able replacement.\nAgainst Leicester he was outstanding. The 25-year-old provided a pinpoint cross for Morrison's headed goal and was alert to Drinkwater's error in the 74th minute, before applying a well-judged finish.\nThe former QPR man was the standout player on the pitch - he managed a goal, an assist, three shots and three key passes.\nMan of match - Matt Phillips (West Brom)\nManager reaction\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"We tried to do our match - the first half wasn't so good, the second was better.\n\"Today it wasn't so easy. Maybe we played too much in Champions League.\n\"We have to speak to find a solution together. I am unhappy because we lost our home record.\n\"We have to stay together as we did last season when everything was right.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"Phillips should score a lot more goals. It is confidence that is the problem for him. He has the tools to be a very good player.\n\"He has got everything a top player needs - power and strength and quality on the ball. The big weakness is his belief; he should have no doubts at all.\n\"I have had a chat with the Chinese owners about bringing good players in over the next few windows. Chadli came in and has been first class - that is what the club have to do.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nLeicester have lost their first home game in the Premier League since September 2015, having previously gone 20 unbeaten (W13 D7).\nThe Foxes conceded more than once in a Premier League home game for just the third time in 2016 (twice against West Brom, once against West Ham).\nWest Brom scored more than once while winning away from home in the Premier League for the first time since April 2015 (2-0 at Crystal Palace).\nThis is the first time Tony Pulis has registered a Premier League victory against a reigning champion, drawing four and losing 10 before today.\nAll four of Islam Slimani's goals for Leicester have been headers and at the King Power Stadium.\nMahrez registered his first assist in the Premier League since March (also against West Brom).\nPhillips scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the third time in his career.\nWhat's next?\nThe Foxes are away at Watford on 19 November for a 15:00 GMT kick-off. Two days later West Brom are at home to Burnley for an 20:00 GMT start."

It was the only effort on target Arsenal had in the match.\nOnly in 2004-05 (18) have Manchester United had fewer points from their opening 12 Premier League games than the 19 points they have so far this season.\nOnly Wayne Rooney (29) has scored more Premier League goals since Juan Mata's debut for the club in January 2014 than Mata himself (24).\nManchester United have drawn three league games in a row at Old Trafford for the first time since April 1992.\nArsenal failed to have a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League match for the first time since April this year, when they played Norwich City.\nWhat they said:\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to Sky Sports: \"The result in the end is positive for us because we were 1-0 down with two minutes to go.\n\"The players who came on made a massive difference today. When you are 1-0 down and come back to 1-1 of course you have to feel happy.\n\"We lacked a bit of sharpness today. What is it down to I don't know but at least we came back.\"\nMan Utd boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to Sky Sports: \"Of course it is two points dropped. We were the best team by far. They had no chances to win.\n\"They could not be Arsenal the way they normally play football. We were phenomenal defensively. The way we pressed and the way we controlled their counter attacks.\n\"The team played very well. This team at the moment is the unluckiest team in the Premier League. That is the reality.\"\nOn the penalty that was never given: \"I don't want to speak about it. He [Andre Marriner] is the kind of referee who if he make mistakes against my team there is no intention. He doesn't want to be the star of the game, he is a good referee. I don't want to say if it is a mistake or not. I know because I saw the video, but I don't want to say because he is a good referee.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United have back-to-back home games against Feyenoord in the Europa League on Thursday, 24 November at 20:05 GMT, followed by a visit from West Ham United next Sunday, 27 November at 16:30 GMT.\nArsenal also have two home games in a row, against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday, 23 November at 19:45 GMT, followed by a Sunday match against Bournemouth next Sunday, 27 November at 14:15 GMT."

        "article_text": "Watford 2-1 Leicester City\nWatford scored inside the opening 33 seconds as they defeated champions Leicester at Vicarage Road.\nEtienne Capoue volleyed the Hornets into the lead - their fastest Premier League goal - before Roberto Pereyra curled in a second after 12 minutes.\nLeicester pulled one back when Riyad Mahrez converted a penalty after Miguel Britos' clumsy foul on Jamie Vardy.\nBut the Foxes could not score again and remain without an away league victory this season.\nLeicester become only the third reigning top-flight champions, after Leeds in 1992 and Blackburn in 1995, to start a Premier League season without a win from their opening six away games.\nRelive Watford v Leicester as it happened\nA crazy start\nWatford had been embarrassed 6-1 at Liverpool in their last match and boss Walter Mazzarri demanded an improved performance.\nBut even he could not have expected the blistering start they made as they went ahead in the opening minute.\nLeicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater, who had missed England's matches against Scotland and Spain with a rib injury, gave the ball away and that enabled Pereyra to sprint down the left wing before his cross was flicked on by Troy Deeney, with Capoue volleying past Ron-Robert Zieler.\nPereyra doubled the advantage shortly after, cutting inside Drinkwater on the edge of the penalty area and curling the ball into the corner.\nLeicester fought back with a penalty after only 14 minutes, but were frustrated and denied by a resolute home defence as the hosts held on for the win.\nWhere have last season's Leicester gone?\nLeicester won the league title for the first time in their history last season but looked a pale shadow of that side at Vicarage Road.\nDefensively vulnerable and lacking a cutting edge up front, the Foxes slipped to their sixth league defeat of the season, double the amount they had throughout the entire 2015-16 campaign.\nOne huge concern for Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri would be the form of centre-forward Vardy. Before the game Ranieri said he expected to see a \"new Vardy\" after he scored in England's 2-2 draw with Spain at Wembley on Tuesday.\nHowever, apart from winning a penalty, which was more down to the reckless challenge from Britos, Vardy looked unlikely to end a goal drought that now stretches to 13 club games.\nHis only attempt came late on when he shot harmlessly wide and the Foxes need him to rediscover the form that saw him score 24 Premier League goals last season.\nPoor domestically, great in Europe\nThis result extends a strange, but worrying quirk for Leicester fans - of their side failing to win any of the five matches they have played immediately before a Champions League game.\nThey remain 14th in the Premier League, but are only two points above the relegation zone, despite impressing in Europe's premier competition.\nWith 10 points from four Champions League games and without a goal conceded, Leicester are top of Group G and only need two points from their last two games to advance into the last 16. The first of those comes on Tuesday when they entertain Belgian side Club Brugge.\nA concern for the Foxes would be that record signing Islam Slimani, who scored the winner in a 1-0 win over Porto, missed the Watford game with what was described as a \"slight groin injury\".\nMan of the match - Roberto Pereyra (Watford)\n99 not out for Deeney\nWatford captain Troy Deeney remains on 99 goals in all competitions for the club. He has been stuck on this tally since 1 October, having failed to score in his last five appearances\nThis was Claudio Ranieri's 50th Premier League game in charge of Leicester. He has won 26, drawn 15 and now lost nine times\nLeicester's Robert Huth made his 300th Premier League appearance, becoming the first German player to reach this milestone\nThis was Watford's first Premier League win over Leicester on their fifth attempt. Leicester have won three times with the other match ending in a draw\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri has not lost in any of the 12 games where he has been in charge of a side against a team managed by Ranieri\nWatford's win was the first time they had beaten a reigning Premier League champion. They had lost four times and drew twice on the other occasions\nWhat they said\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri told BBC Sport: \"We got the win and I'm very happy. We played the football that I like my team to play and this time we were good enough to score.\n\"The way Roberto Pereyra played, not just the goal he scored, he ran the whole game and I am very happy with him.\n\"It was not easy, we know they are a good team. It was our fault with the penalty, in the last 15 or 20 minutes Leicester pressed a lot and we had to concentrate.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri told BBC Sport: \"I said to my players 'well done' as they tried to do everything. At the beginning we were losing 2-0, but we got back in the match.\n\"Of course Watford defended very well. We tried to do our best, the second half was intense but we did not created good chances.\n\"Their two goals made the match. Our performance was good, the spirit was good and I am positive. When you play with this spirit, I'm positive.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester are in action again on Tuesday as they host Club Brugge in the Champions League. A win for the Foxes will take them into the last 16 of the competition.\nThey next play in the Premier League on Saturday, 26 November when they entertain Middlesbrough, with Watford in action the following day with a home league game against Stoke."

It was an away game at Southampton and a good performance - with a clean sheet.\n\"Usually you lose in game like this, because body language is such you end up doing something different and giving one chance away and they score.\n\"When you are ready for work then you deserve the minimum of a draw. Not the best day in our life, but for sure not the worst.\n\"It is tight at the top but not only for us. That is good. All teams are the same. This league is tough and we are here because of this and we like it.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"I think it was a good performance today. We played against a very good team with good players.\n\"It was difficult to play against them because they work very well with a lot of the ball. So it was important to keep discipline to get a point.\n\"We have 15 international players and it is difficult to work without these players during the break. However, what we showed was a good spirit, attitude and discipline. We tried to play good football but it was difficult against this team.\""

Yannick Bolasie and Romelu Lukaku have gone off the boil. Maybe the defeat at Chelsea has had a bigger effect than we thought.\"\nTop scorer Romelu Lukaku's best chance was a ricochet off his thigh in the first half, while Ross Barkley should have scored but could only scuff his shot wide.\nBolasie was lively on the wings but some of his crosses were poor, while the team's delivery from set pieces, especially corners, was also below par.\nRonald Koeman decided to gamble, sending on Gerard Deulofeu for the woeful Aaron Lennon, and substituted centre-back Jagielka for Enner Valencia in a very attacking move.\nThe gamble paid off with the equaliser, as Coleman reacted quickly to a loose ball and headed past Lukasz Fabianski into the top-right corner.\nMan of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson\nWhat they said\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"I agree with our fans when after half-time they whistled the team. They did not play how we can play football, we missed our aggression, we did not win second balls and we changed everything in the second half and that was at least how we need to play at home.\"\nSwansea manager Bob Bradley: \"It feels like a defeat when you give up a late one, it doesn't go away fast, there are some positives but we keep going.

This defeat sees it drop further, to 0.71, and also means their current crisis continues.\nThe Eagles caused City plenty of problems, notably with their pressing game and lightning-fast breaks down the wings.\nBut even when they were putting Pep Guardiola's side under pressure in the second half, Palace looked vulnerable and were ultimately punished for their lack of organisation at the back as they looked to see the game out.\nPalace are full of ideas when they come forward but they have failed to keep a single clean sheet in the league this season.\nAt the moment, their attacking prowess is being undermined by the amount of goals they are leaking.\nSame old story for Kompany\nWhile Toure's return was a shock, seeing Vincent Kompany injured again is becoming a depressingly familiar sight for City fans.\nHis latest setback was nothing to do with his troublesome calf, more just plain bad luck as he was left concussed by a first-half collision with his goalkeeper Claudio Bravo.\nKompany's vision was affected and he had to be replaced a few minutes later, with frustration etched on his face as he trudged towards the tunnel at Selhurst Park.\nThe 30-year-old Belgian was making only his second league start of the season, and is yet to complete 90 minutes in any of his five appearances in all competitions this campaign.\nWhat next?\nCity travel to Germany to take on Borussia Monchengladbach in the Champions League on Wednesday, then make the much shorter journey to play Burnley in the Premier League next Saturday for the early kick-off.\nPalace also hit the road with a trip to Wales where they meet fellow strugglers Swansea on the same day.\nWickham enjoys playing against City...\nConnor Wickham has scored four Premier League goals v Manchester City, more than any other opponent he's faced.\nBoth of Wickham's goals have come from the bench this season, after none of his previous 16 had done.\nToure has scored a Premier League brace for the first time since May 2015. It was his first start for City in the league since April.\nKevin de Bruyne has provided more assists than any other Premier League player this season (7).\nWilfried Zaha has provided an assist in each of his last four Premier League games for Palace.\nZaha also has more Premier League assists this season (5) than his previous three campaigns combined."

They sat deep and that frustrated us for the majority of the game,\" he said.\n\"We didn't deserve to get beaten but didn't do enough to win.\"\nThe Stoke manager also accused Bournemouth of excessive time wasting, saying that the six minutes added time \"could have been 16\".\n\"It was cynical and blatant. We all do it every now and again but never to the extent Bournemouth did today.\n\"It's hard for the refereeing team but I feel they could have been on top of it a lot better.\"\nWrong calls?\nBournemouth were denied what appeared to be a clear penalty in the first half as Shawcross slid in on Wilson inside the area and seemed to bring him down without making any contact with the ball.\nReferee Roger East confidently indicated play on - to the amazement of Cherries players and boss Eddie Howe alike, and the visiting manager had his say after the game.\n\"I'm a big fan of Roger East. I think he's one of the best referees around but he got two big calls wrong today,\" said Howe.\n\"It was definitely a penalty. You are effectively accusing Callum of diving if you don't award it. Shawcross was lucky to still be on the field.\"\nThe other call in question was the penalty awarded for Francis' touch on Bojan at the edge of the area - the missed spot-kick feeling like an injustice avoided for the visitors.\n\"Those two calls from the ref were game changers,\" added Howe. \"It could have been the difference of two goals for us.\"\nMan of the match - Nathan Ake\nNovember no longer a bogey month for Bournemouth\nFour Bournemouth goals in the top flight this season have come from free-kick situations (including direct free-kicks), more than any other side\nOn the other hand, Stoke have shipped a league-high five goals from free-kicks in the Premier League this season\nNathan Ake scored for the first time in his last 15 Premier League games (he has only two in total in 32 appearances)\nJunior Stanislas has been involved in 11 Premier League goals for the Cherries (six goals, five assists), a joint-high tally along with Joshua King (eight goals, three assists)\nBojan's penalty miss was Stoke's first failure in their last 14 Premier League spot-kicks, last fluffing their lines from 12 yards via Jonathan Walters v Liverpool in August 2013\nBournemouth enjoyed their first win in a Premier League game in November, their first away league win for eight games, and their first away clean sheet since February\nThe Potters failed to score for the first time in eight top-flight games\nWhat next?\nBoth teams are heading to London for their next Premier League matches.\nStoke are in action at Watford on Sunday, 27 November, and will be without suspended midfielder Joe Allen. Arsenal loanee Jack Wilshere will not be eligible to face his parent club as Bournemouth visit Emirates Stadium on the same day."

        "article_text": "Sunderland 3-0 Hull\nJermain Defoe scored his 150th Premier League goal as Sunderland comfortably beat Hull City at the Stadium of Light to move off the foot of the table.\nDefoe's darting run and firm low finish made him just the eighth player in Premier League history to bring up the milestone and set Sunderland on their way to consecutive top-flight wins for the first time since May.\nThe in-form Victor Anichebe scored twice after the break for David Moyes' rejuvenated side, who remain inside the bottom three but are now two points ahead of Swansea and just two behind third-bottom Hull.\nThe Tigers had more possession and more chances than their hosts in an open and entertaining game, but in Jordan Pickford they found an impressive young goalkeeper in no mood to be beaten.\nPapy Djilobodji's late red card for a second caution took some of the gloss off for Sunderland, whose fans nevertheless went away jubilant after a first home win of the season.\nRelive Sunderland's victory\nEvergreen Defoe shows his class\nIt was fitting that Defoe brought up his personal milestone with a trademark strike, latching on to Duncan Watmore's flick-on, running at and beating Curtis Davies and ghosting past Ahmed Elmohamady before tucking the ball home with a short-backlift shot that has been his bread and butter at this level for a decade and a half.\nDefoe scored his first top-flight goal for West Ham in 3-2 win over Ipswich on 28 October 2001,\n, external\nand over 15 years later his instincts in front of goal remain as sharp as ever.\nThe goal elevates the 34-year-old into an elite group of Premier League predators, comprising Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney, Andy Cole, Frank Lampard, Thierry Henry, Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen.\nHaving also scored in the battling 2-1 win over Bournemouth before the international break, Defoe's importance to Sunderland's Premier League hopes cannot be overstated.\nAnd in Anichebe it would seem Defoe has the perfect foil up front.\nThe burly forward linked well with his diminutive partner throughout and took both of his goals superbly, first finishing low past David Marshall after good work by Patrick van Aanholt and then killing the game off late on with a thunderous effort off the post.\nIt was Anichebe's first Premier League double since December 2006, when he played for Moyes' Everton against Newcastle.\nStadium of Light goes dark\nSunderland fans can tick a few boxes on their entertainment checklist after this match.\nBig win? Check. Clean sheet? Check. Off the bottom of the table? Check. Floodlights on the blink? Check.\nPlay was suspended for 10 minutes after the lights inside the stadium flickered out in the 49th minute, triggering cheers from the crowd and followed moments later by the light of thousands of mobile phones illuminating the stands.\nReferee Lee Mason was seen sharing a joke with the two managers as the lights slowly came back on, although even after the resumption the game was played in an eerie half-light.\nIf the players could not see as well it did not show, with the action fast and furious after the restart.\nAnichebe's first goal was followed by a string of good chances for Hull, with Pickford saving well from Robert Snodgrass' overhead kick and then getting down superbly to keep out Davies' header at a corner, although team-mate Van Aanholt was required to preserve his clean sheet with quick-fire goal-line clearances from Dieumerci Mbokani and David Meyler.\nMan of the match - Victor Anichebe\nDefoe second only to Kane\nDefoe has scored 18 Premier League goals in 2016, while Harry Kane (19) is the only Englishman who has scored more in this period.\nJosh Tymon is the youngest player to make a Premier League appearance for Hull (17 years, 181 days), breaking the record held by Mark Cullen (18 years, 2 days) which was also against Sunderland in April 2010.\nThe Tigers haven't kept a clean sheet in the Premier League since a 2-0 win over Swansea in August - they have conceded 26 goals in 10 games since then.\nSunderland kept their first Premier League clean sheet of the season and their first since May against Everton - the only Premier League team without a clean sheet this season is Crystal Palace.\nManager reaction\nSunderland boss David Moyes said: \"Victor Anichebe was immense, probably even better than he was [against Bournemouth last time out] and he has this capability of doing it.\n\"He needs to be loved and I think the supporters are helping him because he wants that.\n\"The supporters are enjoying him and I hope they keep backing him. He is a handful and really powerful - if he adds goals to it he's a terrific player.\"\nOn the floodlights failing in the second half, Moyes added: \"When the lights go out, you never know what the reason is. We maybe spent all our money and not on the electricity bill.\n\"The worry was they wouldn't get it back on, but thankfully they did and we got through it.\"\nHull City boss Mike Phelan said: \"It was all the emotions in one game today, frustration from the point of view that we didn't take our opportunities - and there were quite a few.\n\"But then there is the annoyance. The disappointment is you lose a game 3-0 with a team you believe in. We actually probably deserved a little bit better overall.\"\nOn the floodlight failure, he added: \"There was no doubt about the game. The referee conducted himself right.\n\"He was a little bit concerned about the ground being only partially lit, but at the end we needed to get the game going and the supporters demanded that.\n\"It probably changed the game a little bit at one point.\"\nWhat's next?\nSunderland face a tough assignment away at Liverpool on 26 November (15:00 GMT), while Hull are back in action on the same day and at the same time at home to West Brom."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 West Ham United\nTottenham maintained their unbeaten start to the Premier League season amid high drama as Harry Kane struck twice at the death in a breathless victory over West Ham at White Hart Lane.\nMichail Antonio's first-half header and a Manuel Lanzini penalty had put West Ham 2-1 up and seemingly on course for only a fourth league win of the season, but Kane's late show emphatically turned the contest on its head.\nFirst the England striker turned home from close range after good work down the left by substitute Son Heung-Min, while two minutes later the South Korean was brought down in the area by Havard Nordtveit and Kane tucked away the resulting spot-kick.\nEarlier, 20-year-old midfielder Harry Winks had equalised for Tottenham on his full Premier League debut, but Lanzini's penalty - awarded after Vincent Janssen pulled back Winston Reid in the area - put West Ham back in the driving seat before Kane intervened.\nSpurs are now 12 games unbeaten at the start of the season - the last time they managed that was in the 1960-61 season, which ended with the north Londoners claiming a league and cup double.\nFor now Tottenham must content themselves with a fairly modest fifth place in the standings after a run of six wins and six draws, while shell-shocked West Ham - who lost Reid to a second bookable offence in added time - remain 17th and just a point outside the relegation zone.\nRelive Tottenham's dramatic victory\nA tale of two Harrys\nKane was largely anonymous for much of the match, with the focus and plaudits for the most part falling on midfielder Winks, handed his first start in the league in place of Dele Alli, who was named on the bench after returning from injury.\nWinks has been in and around the first team for the last couple of years and finally earned a first league start in the intense spotlight of a London derby. In such circumstances do young players show their worth, and on this evidence Winks is set to be a fixture in the Spurs set-up for some considerable time.\nHe looked confident in possession, wanting the ball and using it well. And when the chance came to get on the scoresheet he did not hesitate, lashing home the rebound after Janssen's long-range shot was parried by Darren Randolph.\nIn contrast, Kane had a frustrating 89 minutes but burst to life when his team needed him most.\nRandolph - who earlier produced a truly stunning save to deny Eric Dier with his side 2-1 up - will be disappointed with his part in the goal, diverting the ball into Kane's path as he attempted to cut out Son's low centre.\nBut he had no chance with Kane's second from the spot - a powerful, confident strike befitting a 20-goals-a-season striker.\nSon helps send Hammers to harsh defeat\nWest Ham more than played their part in a highly entertaining contest, and will return to east London wondering how they managed to not take at least a point with them.\nAntonio's well-taken header after Cheikhou Kouyate hit the bar gave them the lead against the run of play, but their improved performance after the break meant it was less of a surprise when Lanzini lashed home their second from the penalty spot.\nIn that moment West Ham became the first team to score more than one goal against Spurs in the league this season, and Slaven Bilic's men looked good value for it.\nBut the 72nd-minute entrance of Son for Mousa Dembele proved a turning point.\nThe former Bayer Leverkusen forward first raced past Antonio to deliver a cross via the palm of Randolph that Kane turned home, and was then smart enough to invite a wild challenge from fellow substitute Nordtveit, cutting inside and leaving his standing leg invitingly in the path of the defender's needless lunge.\nHaving already awarded a league-high eight penalties this season, referee Mike Dean made it a ninth. Kane was the gleeful recipient from 12 yards.\nMan of the match - Harry Winks\nManager reaction\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was really important to get the three points, it was a very tough game, I'm very pleased with the performance.\n\"West Ham were very good and we showed big character and personality, the team always try to find the goal and for that I am very pleased. The players fought until the last minute and the reward was unbelievable.\n\"Harry Kane is always very important, he is our main striker and one of the best strikers in the world. You miss that type of player when he does not play for 10 or 11 games. The table looks much better, we are three points off the top and 12 unbeaten from the beginning.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic says: \"We are extremely disappointed and when you are 2-1 up with three minutes to go, to concede two goals is very hard to take. We had three really good opportunities to score the third.\n\"I think we were the better side in the first half hour then we started to lose the ball quite quickly. After we scored (to make it 2-1) that was the crucial time to hold on or score a third.\n\"We had some good counter-attacks and we should have killed the game. We have a tough schedule but we showed we can put in a really good performance.\"\nStats - 160 seconds of high drama\nKane has netted in each of his last four Premier League games; equalling his joint-best scoring streak in the competition.\nThere were 160 seconds between Kane's two goals for Spurs against West Ham.\nAntonio has scored 11 headed goals in the Premier League in 2016, more than twice as many as any other player in the competition (Aguero and Benteke next, on five).\nAntonio has also equalled the Premier League record for headed goals in a calendar year (11, joint with Tim Cahill in 2010).\nWest Ham have received more red cards than any other Premier League team since the start of last season (7).\nWhat's next?\nA big week lies in store for Spurs. On Tuesday they travel to Monaco for a vital Champions League group match (19:45 GMT), while on Saturday they have the small matter of a Premier League match at London rivals Chelsea (17:30). West Ham are back in action next Sunday, visiting Manchester United in the Premier League (16:30)."

And it has helped the Blues move top of the table for the first time since they were crowned champions in May 2015.\nNow back-to-back matches against Tottenham and Manchester City will be another measure of their recent improvement.\nCosta the fulcrum for Blues\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte was effusive in his praise of Costa before the game, labelling the Spain international as \"one of the best strikers in the world\".\nOn this evidence it is hard to disagree.\nWhile the former Atletico Madrid frontman did not find himself presented with plenty of goalscoring chances, he was constantly bothering the Boro centre-backs with his movement, strength and willingness to chase seemingly lost causes.\nAnd, most importantly, he was clinical when a sniff of an opportunity arrived.\nBoro failed to deal with Eden Hazard's inswinging corner just before half-time, Costa reacting quickest to instinctively stab in an angled effort from inside the six-yard box.\nWith Hazard quiet in comparison to recent weeks, Costa was the fulcrum of the visitors' attacking play.\nThe 28-year-old matchwinner also teed up chances for Pedro, Marcos Alonso and Hazard, showing once again he is back to the form which helped the Blues win the Premier League title 18 months ago in his first season at the club.\nShy Boro lack attacking edge\nHistory was not on Middlesbrough's side going into the match, having lost their previous six matches against Chelsea without managing to score.\nA lack of cutting edge proved to be their undoing again.\nMarshalled by skipper Ben Gibson, the home side were organised and restricted one of the title contenders to a handful of clear-cut chances.\nWhile they only trailed by a single goal, Boro - who fought back to snatch a draw at Manchester City in their last outing - had hope.\nHowever, just one shot on target tells you where their problems lie.\n\"We stayed in the game until the end but didn't get the point we think we deserved. There are positives to take,\" said Gibson.\nMan of the match - Diego Costa (Chelsea)\nWhat they said\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka told BBC Sport: \"It is frustrating. We knew before the game we were playing against a top-of-the-table team.\n\"But after our last performances against Arsenal and Manchester City we were confident and we showed again we can compete against those teams.\n\"One mistake punished us. But if we keep playing like we have done in the past few games. we will win more games. The team is improving.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte told BBC Sport: \"I knew this game would be difficult because this team is well organised and they are in good form.\n\"But we deserved to win because we scored the goal and created many chances for a second goal.\n\"The first five minutes wasn't good for us. Middlesbrough started very well and we started badly but during the game our possession got better and we started to move the ball quicker. We didn't concede and stopped any opportunity for them to score.\"\nNo home comforts for Boro...\nChelsea have won six Premier League games in a row without conceding - the 10th time it has happened in Premier League history and the fifth time for Chelsea\nDiego Costa is the first player to reach double figures in Premier League goals this season\nCosta has scored in six of his past seven league away games, netting seven goals in total in that run\nOnly Swansea (two) have won fewer points at home in the Premier League than Middlesbrough this season (four)\nNo side has scored fewer top-flight goals at home than Boro (five, level with Hull and Swansea)\nBoro winger Adama Traore completed 12 dribbles in this match, more than any other player in a single Premier League game this season\nWhat's next?\nA big test of Chelsea's title credentials. The Blues host Tottenham at Stamford Bridge next Saturday (17:30 GMT). Meanwhile, Boro go to champions Leicester City earlier on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

The 6ft 2in forward's hold-up play allowed Morrison to provide an attacking threat and the Scotland midfielder, recently back from a long-term injury, scored a terrific second.\nHis countryman Fletcher then added a third from close-range just before half-time, the first time since 2009 that three Scottish players had scored in one Premier League game.\nRondon was rewarded for his admirable efforts for the team with a low strike in the 64th minute.\nSloppy Burnley punished\nThis was the first time this season Burnley had finished a league game with more than 50% possession, which highlights how those statistics cannot be relied upon to tell the tale of the game.\nThe Clarets out-passed West Brom 483-401 but were guilty of giving the ball away in dangerous areas. Keane and Heaton - touted as future England players - were exposed at the back, with the keeper at fault when he allowed Morrison's strike to beat him while his sloppy pass almost resulted in a second for the Scot.\nThe only time Baggies keeper Ben Foster was troubled was when he tipped Johann Berg Gudmundsson's free-kick on to the bar.\nMan of the match - Salomon Rondon (West Brom)\n'Salomon feels part of the group'\nBaggies boss Tony Pulis praised his team and striker Rondon's display against Burnley.\n\"We are pleased - it was going to be a tough game, Sean Dyche's players are honest and hard-working but we got goals at the right time,\" he said.\n\"Every three points are enormous and back-to-back wins are very important. I'm pleased for the supporters as well.\n\"We will take every game as it comes - the most important thing is to make sure we are ready for Hull this weekend, that will be such a tough game.\n\"I'm pleased for Salomon, who has upped his game this season. He has settled in, he feels part of the group and he is such a smashing lad.\"\n'We need to show more belief'\nPulis' counterpart Sean Dyche said his side need more belief away from home.\n\"It was not good enough - the first half particularly. The game was done at half-time,\" said the Clarets boss.\n\"We just got drunk on keeping the ball and playing in front of them and that is what they want you to do, so they can counter attack. We got sucked into it - even though we had told the players what to expect.\n\"We have good points on the board but you have to build on what you are doing at home and take that on the road. I think some of that is a mentality thing - to play with more belief.\n\"We have had two below-par performances on TV - here and at Southampton, we were miles off it.\n\"I broke my leg here at 17 and I have never had a result here - one of the few grounds in the country where I have had nothing.\"\nWest Brom equal their best margin of victory\nThis was the second time three different Scottish players scored for a team in a Premier League game (also Burnley v Man City, November 2009).\nThis was only the third time in 284 games that a side managed by Pulis have scored four goals in a Premier League game, two of which have been this season with West Brom (4-0 v Burnley and 4-2 v West Ham).\nWest Brom's 4-0 win over Burnley is their joint-biggest margin of victory in a Premier League match.\nBurnley haven't won away in the league at the Hawthorns since December 1969, losing on nine of their 10 visits since.\nSince the start of 2015/16, Rondon has been involved in 17 Premier League goals (13 goals, 4 assists); more than any other WBA player.\nMorrison netted in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since September 2008.\nPhillips scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career.\nCraig Dawson made his 100th Premier League appearance for West Brom, becoming the 12th player to reach this milestone for the Baggies.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley have a tough home fixture against Manchester City at 12:30 GMT on Saturday and West Brom are at Hull on the same day (15:00 GMT)."

He had a really good game,\" said Guardiola.\n\"From the beginning he was ready, his body language was very good.\"\nRobinson's key saves cannot save Burnley\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche wanted a reaction from his side after the 4-0 hammering by West Brom on Monday, and he certainly got it as they were back to their tenacious selves against City.\nDyche's side had a strong shout for a penalty after Otamendi shoved Jeff Hendrick before Marney gave them the lead with his first top-flight goal in 2,558 days.\nThe home side were helped by 37-year-old keeper Paul Robinson, making his Clarets debut and first Premier League appearance since May 2012. He produced three key saves before a \"comedy of errors\" cost them the winner.\n\"I can't believe we haven't had a penalty again,\" said Dyche. \"You need those decisions in these games. It's an obvious smash in the back and is a penalty.\"\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero\nWhat they said:\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"We deliberately made it awkward for City, by pressing them and playing it forward earlier than I usually believe in.\n\"Generally it worked very well. I was pleased with our understanding and execution of our tactical plan, and we created enough to get something out of the game.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"I have to learn how to control the second balls because in Spain and Germany teams do not play long or with these flat balls and crosses with the same intensity, or so frequently as Burnley did.\n\"All of our players showed huge character and we are so happy because this week was very important for us.\n\"The other thing I have to learn about English football is the referees. Sometimes it is a foul, sometimes it isn't. I am not judging them but it is simple like that - here it is completely different to other countries.\"\nKey stats - Burnley pair end long waits\nManchester City have lost just one of their past 15 top-flight games, winning nine and drawing five\nDean Marney's last top-flight goal came for Hull v Everton in November 2009\nPaul Robinson started a Premier League game for the first time since May 2012 (vs Wigan) - 1,664 days ago\nWhat next?\nManchester City will host title rivals Chelsea on Saturday, 3 December at 12:30 GMT in their next game, while Burnley make a trip to Stoke for a 15:00 kick-off on the same day."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-0 Sunderland\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 11 games with a win against Sunderland but could face a spell without Philippe Coutinho who was taken off on a stretcher at Anfield.\nThe Brazillian clutched his ankle after a challenge from Didier Ndong late in a first half where Liverpool failed to turn 80% possession into clear chances.\nSunderland threatened briefly in each period, with Steven Pienaar and Duncan Watmore taking heavy touches when presented with openings.\nBut as Jurgen Klopp's side continued to press, it was Coutinho's replacement, Divock Origi, who found the net with what appeared to be a right-foot cross from the left side of the area.\nRelive Liverpool's win over Sunderland\nCoutinho suffers injury\nIt sparked relief at Anfield and when Ndong felled Sadio Mane in the box, James Milner converted a spot-kick to make it 14 games unbeaten in all competitions for the Reds.\nThey now sit second in the table, a point behind Chelsea, while Sunderland drop to bottom spot.\nKlopp's demand for more answered\nCoutinho's injury, coupled with admirable Sunderland resistance, kept home fans quiet for long spells.\nKlopp clearly banks on Anfield being an intimidating place to visit and a return of 16 points from 18 available at home this season points to him getting his wish.\nBut he was visibly frustrated early in the second half when he waved to the Kop and demanded more from supporters.\nSunderland created their best opening moments later when Liverpool keeper Loris Karius dived at Watmore's feet to block and Victor Anichebe's shot in the following melee was cleared.\nBut Liverpool's positivity was undeniable, with full-backs Milner and Nathaniel Clyne playing high up the pitch, Emre Can repeatedly joining attacks and even centre-back Joel Matip spending long spells in midfield.\nThey missed chances through a Dejan Lovren header and a Georginio Wijnaldum volley. But with a touch of fortune, Origi's in-swinging cross nestled in the corner and Milner's penalty was emphatic.\nWith no European football to distract them and no league defeat since August, Liverpool have clear momentum. Their former skipper Steven Gerrard watched their latest win from the stands just days after his retirement. Are Klopp's men capable of landing the one honour which eluded him?\nA win at a cost?\nHow Liverpool deal with a potential lay-off for Coutinho will be critical in whether their momentum can lead to a push for that elusive Premier League title.\nHis contribution of five goals and six assists in the league sums up the key role he has under Klopp and his all-round displays have seen reports of interest from Barcelona.\nAgainst David Moyes' side Coutinho seemed to be man-marked early on. When he escaped the attentions of Jason Denayer after half an hour he took a heavy touch in the area and felt the full force of Ndong's clearance.\nThere was no suggestion of a foul but Coutinho's foot took the impact of both the ball and Ndong's follow-through, and he instantly waved to the bench before grimacing during treatment.\nOrigi's impact points to Liverpool having the resources to deal with any spell out for Coutinho. But with Mane primed to attend the African Cup of Nations with Senegal in January, Klopp will desperately hope he has not lost arguably his most creative force for long.\n'The most defensive team I ever saw'\nMoyes had spoken of \"parking the double decker bus at Anfield\" and for long spells that tactic was deployed.\nBut Sunderland clearly had confidence as a result of back-to-back wins and they threatened early on, notably when Pienaar's heavy touch gave Karius the chance to save.\nFrustratingly for their travelling contingent, the Black Cats dropped deep after half an hour and never really established a footing again. Denayer played the full match in midfield yet made just seven passes. He perhaps summed up Sunderland's retreat.\n\"This was the most defensive team I ever saw in my life,\" said Klopp afterwards.\nMan of the match - Jordan Henderson\nWhat the managers said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"It was an intense game for us and a deserved win at the end. Sunderland always play a defensive style and that is OK. We forced them to be that. It is the most difficult thing in world football to come through but we stayed concentrated, worked for the moment and found a way.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"I thought we had done enough to keep them out. But overall we worked very hard to stay in the game. We were never going to come here and have lots of chances so it was always going to be tough. But we weren't going to be rolled over and we weren't.\"\nStats - Origi the super-sub\nFive of Divock Origi's six Premier League goals for Liverpool have come as a substitute.\nOnly Burnley (19.6%) have posted a lower possession figure than Sunderland (22.5%) in a Premier League game this season [both v Liverpool].\nKlopp named an unchanged starting line-up in the Premier League for the first time since October 2015 [previously 40 games without doing so].\nJordan Henderson (117) completed 100 or more passes for the third time in a Premier League game this season; he's the only player to do so on more than one occasion.\nUp next?\nLiverpool host Leeds in the EFL Cup before travelling to Bournemouth next Sunday, while Sunderland have a week of rest before entertaining league champions Leicester - who are now just four points better off then them."

Crucially, though, they kept going and salvaged a valuable point.\nIt came on the back of Tuesday's 2-1 win over Club Brugge, which secured their passage to the knockout stages of the Champions League with a game to spare.\nImportantly, it ensured Leicester did not slip to a third successive Premier League defeat.\n\"We showed fantastic character,\" said Foxes boss Claudio Ranieri. \"Lucky is someone who believes in something more.\"\nNegredo ends goalscoring drought\nNegredo, who is on a season-long loan from Valencia, found the net for the first time since Boro's 1-1 draw against Stoke City on 13 August.\nIt was not just the powerful Spaniard's finishing that caught the eye at the King Power Stadium either.\nNegredo held the ball up, linked up the play and was generally a handful for the Leicester defence.\nHe scored 23 goals in 48 appearances for Manchester City en route to helping them win the Premier League title in 2013-14. This display was reminiscent of those days.\nGiven his side's overall lack of goals this season, Boro boss Aitor Karanka will hope it represents the start of a hot streak for Negredo.\nVardy draws a blank again\nWhile Negredo was back among the goals, Jamie Vardy's struggles to find the net continue.\nVardy has not scored for the champions since 10 September - a run of 15 games. His form is in stark contrast to a year ago, when he scored for a record 11th Premier League game in a row.\nWithout Danny Drinkwater, suspended for three matches for elbowing Watford's Valon Behrami, Leicester tried too many high balls, which did not utilise Vardy's strengths.\nBut irrespective of that, Vardy's performance was subdued, as was his body language.\nHe could have few complaints when substituted with 25 minutes left.\nMan of the match - Alvaro Negredo (Middlesbrough)\nThou shalt not pass\nRiyad Mahrez has found Jamie Vardy with only one pass in the last eight Premier League matches that they have played together and has only created one goalscoring chance for the England forward all season in the competition.\nLeicester's return of 13 points is the second-worst record after 13 games of any defending champion in top-flight history since it became three points for a win in 1981.\nMiddlesbrough conceded two penalties after a run of 48 league games without one.\nLeicester City (417) have already been trailing for more minutes in the Premier League this season than in the entire 2015-16 campaign (391).\nMahrez has two goals and one assist in his last three appearances following nine Premier League games without any of either.\nAlvaro Negredo has been directly involved in six Premier League goals this season (three goals, three assists); more than any other Middlesbrough player.\nNegredo's first strike against Leicester ended a run of 977 minutes without a Premier League goal for Middlesbrough.\nSince the start of last season, Leicester have taken (18) and scored (14) more penalties than any other Premier League team.\nWhat they said:\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We are fighting for a relegation battle. Now we could be tired but fortunately the character and spirit of the group is good. We knew it was a tough match. Twice fighting back is not easy.\n\"It was difficult to surprise Middlesbrough, who showed good football to score twice. It's a good performance in the end, I think the draw for us is very good.\n\"It was important not have to have three Premier League defeats. I feel we have to fight until the end of season.\"\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"We showed we are a good team and are playing well. We should have won the game and were better than them.\n\"It's unfair to draw this game. Our performances with and without the ball have been good. Against top teams, we have been really organised.\n\"I know how good Alvaro Negredo is, and knew the goals would arrive. He did that because the team worked hard. We all have to keep working now.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester are in action again on Saturday, 3 December (15:00 GMT) when they travel to face Sunderland. Middlesbrough host Hull City two days later on Monday, 5 December (20:00)."

But look past the scoreline and it was a game that featured truly atrocious defending.\nPalace took the lead in the 19th minute when Wilfried Zaha easily wriggled away from Neil Taylor and Federico Fernandez before slotting a low angled shot past Lukasz Fabianski.\nThe Swans hit back in the 36th minute through Iceland's Gylfi Sigurdsson, when he whipped his 20-yard free-kick over the wall and inside keeper Wayne Hennessey's far post.\nIt was 1-1 at half time and midway through the second period there was little to suggest of what was about to unfold.\nThen the match exploded.\nDutch midfielder Leroy Fer scored twice at the far post in the space of two minutes. His first was following up from Llorente's blocked header - the Spaniard's first touch of the match - before he poked in after Sigurdsson's free-kick was flicked on by Jordi Amat.\nA 3-1 lead became 3-2 in the 75th minute when the Swans failed to clear their six-yard area and James Tomkins poked in.\nWhat followed was a goal rush:\n3-3, 82 mins: Palace's Wilfried Zaha curls a delivery into the area which is inadvertently flicked in by Jack Cork.\n3-4, 84 mins: Palace striker Christian Benteke's snapshot comes off the post and goes in.\n4-4, 91 mins: Swans forward Llorente pokes in high past Wayne Hennessey from Sigurdsson's shot, after his initial effort was saved.\n5-4, 93 mins: After a scramble in the area, Llorente stabs the loose ball past Hennessey.\nReferee Kevin Friend played another four minutes of stoppage time, but Swansea weathered Palace's final assault for a much-needed three points after a thrilling contest.\nLlorente laughs last\nThe Spanish striker was dropped from the squad for last weekend's match at Everton, and this week his agent was reported in Italian media to have said that \"things aren't going well\" under new manager Bob Bradley.\nThe American boss explained in the build-up to the match against Palace that Llorente had a future at the club but suggested he lacked fitness.\nBradley decided to twist and bring on the former Athletic Bilbao striker, nicknamed El Rey Leon [The Lion King], who made an instant impact with a header that led to Fer's first.\nBut it was two goals in stoppage time that will have ensured him of a place among the hearts of Swans and could prove to be a timely fillip for both player and club.\nSwansea boss Bradley said: \"That's one we won't forget. I've been on the wrong side of those occasionally. I'm going to give the players all the credit today. They fought until the end.\"\nWhat now for Pardew?\nPalace boss Alan Pardew is favourite with the bookmakers to be the next Premier League manager to get the chop.\nFor a man who has been tipped for the England job, he is possibly now waiting for a call from his own board.\nThis is the first time since November 2013 that Palace have lost six league games in succession. The former Newcastle manager also endured a slump with Palace last season when his side had a spell of losing seven games in nine.\nOn the current unwanted run, Pardew said: \"They all hurt.\"\nHe added: \"I thought Swansea did well and we were hanging on and then the game went into a period of madness of goals. Bad goals for them and bad goals for us. In the end, five bad goals for us and four for them.\n\"I'm very disappointed the way we defended, particularly the last two goals when we got ourselves in front.\"\nPalace have earned 22 points from 32 matches in 2016 - the fewest of any team in the top four divisions in England.\nWickham worry\nBoth sets of fans were in unison when they applauded Palace striker Connor Wickham off the pitch after he suffered a \"serious injury\".\nThe former Sunderland striker came off on a stretcher after he dug his foot into the turf awkwardly in an attempt to tackle Gylfi Sigurdsson.\nPardew said: \"Those seven minutes he was getting treatment proved costly for us. A really tough day for us.\"\nMan of the match - Fernando Llorente\n'We still have a long way to go'\nSwansea manager Bob Bradley: \"The players have shown a good way throughout and, for them to have something positive, I think it's important to have something to change the luck man.\n\"I can't say it enough, it's a great bunch of guys and an unbelievable club but when things are going in the wrong direction, it just takes sometimes a lot of determination and courage.\n\"You can only repeat that message so many times until it gets old. Today I don't need to say much, I can let them feel good about it.\n\"They get an extra day off and then we get back to work knowing we still have a long way to go.\"\nSigurdsson on par with Mata and Eriksen\nThis was the 21st Premier League game to see nine or more goals scored.\nThe Eagles scored four goals in a Premier League away game for only the third time ever and the first since April 2015 (4-1 v Sunderland).\nSwansea netted five goals for only the second time ever in the Premier League (also 5-0 v QPR in August 2012).\nPardew's side have now gone 18 top-flight games without a clean sheet, longer than any other current side.\nSince his Premier League debut in January 2012, Sigurdsson has bagged six direct free-kicks goals in the top-flight, a joint-high along with Christian Eriksen and Juan Mata.\nWhat's next?\nOnce they get their breath back, Swansea are at Tottenham next Saturday and Crystal Palace are at home to Southampton (both 15:00 GMT)."

The Italian has been as good as his word and he has presided over a remarkable transformation.\nHe switched to three at the back, which has left no place for captain John Terry but has made surprise \u00a330m summer signing David Luiz look more comfortable than in his first spell at Stamford Bridge.\nConte has also brought the best out of Pedro, who had struggled at Chelsea after his move from Barcelona, while Diego Costa is a warrior whose eyes are now right on the ball rather than opponents.\nChelsea look a solid, dangerous, formidable outfit and that desperate day at Emirates Stadium seems an age away after these seven straight league wins.\nReborn Moses stars again\nVictor Moses seemed destined for life away from Stamford Bridge after a succession of loan spells following his \u00a39m move from Wigan Athletic in August 2012.\nThe 25-year-old had only made 23 appearances and scored one goal for Chelsea before this season and had stints at Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham United before Conte took charge at Stamford Bridge.\nConte's tactical reshuffling saw Moses employed as a right wing-back in his new defensive system, the catalyst for an unlikely revival that has seen him emerge as one of Chelsea's most important players.\nMoses is utilising his attacking qualities to give Chelsea width while also revelling in his more defensive duties, adding a new dimension to his own game and rewarding a manager who has complete trust in him.\nThe crucial goal he scored here was just reward for another fine performance and he fully deserved the standing ovation he was given when he was substituted.\nDesperate week for Spurs\nThis loss in a game they controlled serenely for almost 45 minutes concludes a desperate week for Spurs and manager Pochettino.\nThe Argentine's team selection for the defeat in Monaco that confirmed their Champions League elimination almost seemed to have one eye on this game - but two losses suggest the ploy has backfired.\nPochettino restored Jan Vertonghen, Kyle Walker and Christian Eriksen here and while the Dane put Spurs ahead they ran out of steam and ideas after Pedro equalised in the dying seconds of the first half.\nNow Pochettino must pick up his disappointed players.\nMan of the match: Diego Costa (Chelsea)\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"I am satisfied with the way we fought back. These games are difficult. It was a tough game with a lot of intensity.\n\"Tottenham started well. It's not easy to go down 1-0 but I am pleased with the performance and reaction. Now it's important to continue the work.\n\"It's too early to talk of the title. This league is very tough. Tottenham showed in this league there are six or seven teams that can win the title. It's important to continue in this way and improve the confidence.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"If we analyse the game we were better. We competed very well and we were a bit unlucky to concede...never 1-1 at half-time. The second half we conceded a goal very early.\n\"We are disappointed but we need to be pleased for the performance and the way we competed against a very good team.\"\nUp next?\nChelsea travel to Manchester City next Saturday for a clash between first and joint-second in the Premier League. Tottenham are at home against Swansea on the same day."

You offer your hand win, lose or draw. In fairness, he came and apologised but I think he was told to.\"\nOn Stoke's win: \"We were a little bit stretched in terms of personnel. I thought we worked really well and made it happen, I think that was the key. To a man they ran and made it work.\"\nWatford boss Walter Mazzarri on the missed handshake: \"I was very angry at that moment with the referee and the time he gave at the end. I went into the dressing room and gave Mark my hand. I forgot in that moment.\n\"But I was angry with the referee for not giving a lot of time and the decisions he gave. You have to look at the whole game - the fouls, the goal they scored and the yellow cards.\n\"Anyone can have a bad day. And this time, he had a bad day.\"\nHappy hunting ground\nStoke have won on five of their past seven visits to Vicarage Road.\nThe Potters have conceded just five goals in their past eight Premier League games after conceding 18 goals in the eight games prior to that.\nHeurelho Gomes is the ninth Brazilian to score a Premier League own goal and only the second goalkeeper, following Julio Cesar against Everton for QPR in October 2012.\nIt was Watford's 10th Premier League own goal and their first since May 2016 (Craig Cathcart against Norwich).\nOnly Sunderland (three) have received more red cards than Watford in the Premier League this season (two).\nNo side has conceded more goals from corners in the Premier League this season than Watford (seven).\nThe Hornets failed to score in a home Premier League game for the first time since March.\nWhat's next?\nWatford are at West Brom on 3 December (15:00 GMT), when Stoke host Burnley.\nReaction"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-1 Bournemouth\nArsenal ended a run of three successive draws as Alexis Sanchez scored twice and Theo Walcott once to secure victory over Bournemouth.\nThe pressure was on the Gunners after rivals Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City won on Saturday, and they were gifted the lead when Steve Cook's poor backpass allowed Sanchez to calmly side-foot past Adam Federici.\nBut Callum Wilson equalised with a penalty after referee Mike Jones judged the striker was fouled by Nacho Monreal and, against a rattled home side, Bournemouth missed two good chances when an unmarked Adam Smith headed over before Brad Smith had an angled shot saved.\nArsenal almost restored their lead when a Sanchez strike came off the crossbar but Walcott did score when he headed in a Monreal cross.\nMonreal escaped conceding another penalty when a Simon Francis pass struck him on the arm in the area before keeper Petr Cech made a crucial save from Benik Afobe.\nSanchez made sure of the win when he slotted in an Olivier Giroud cross, moving the Gunners three points behind top-flight leaders Chelsea and two shy of Liverpool and City.\nRelive Arsenal v Bournemouth\nSanchez and Walcott give Arsenal edge\nWalcott's second child was born on Friday, and he marked the occasion with his sixth league goal of the campaign, already one more than he managed in the whole of last season.\nThe winger's tally is his best in the top flight since 2012-13, when he scored 14, and he helped provide a much-needed win for Arsene Wenger's side as they extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 games.\nArsenal had struggled to produce their best and most fluent football in some recent high-profile games, having drawn with Tottenham, Manchester United and Paris St-Germain in their past three outings, and, at times, looked less than secure against the Cherries.\nHowever, even though the Gunners - with 51.8% of the ball - did not dominate possession as much as they are used to, they did show signs of a return to form, especially in the second half.\nSanchez's work-rate and threat in front of goal are key to their prospects. He ended a run of four Arsenal games without a goal as he took his league tally to eight for the season.\n\"We started to click again, even though it was in patches,\" said Walcott.\nBournemouth give Arsenal scare\nThe scoreline did not reflect Bournemouth's efforts and, not only will they be left to rue referee Jones' decision not to give a penalty for Monreal's handball, they will also regret some of their missed chances.\nThey took the game to the Gunners and the result might have been different had Smith done better than heading high from 10 yards after Nathan Ake nodded a free-kick back across goal.\nSmith also appeared to make the wrong decision when he chose to have an angled shot, which was saved by Cech, rather than square the ball for Wilson.\nCech also denied Afobe late on as the visitors matched the Gunners in terms of shots on target, with both registering three apiece.\n\"We are disappointed,\" said Cherries boss Eddie Howe, who was without on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, as he was ineligible to play against his parent club. \"We came here to win and leave with our heads held high.\"\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\nWhat they said:\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We got better during the game but Bournemouth played well. They started with a high intensity. We had to improve our level in the second half and we did.\n\"Our players questioned themselves a little bit after a few draws but we have responded.\"\nOn Mathieu Debuchy, the right-back who went off injured after making his first start for the club since November 2015: \"It was the backheel that killed him. We are devastated for him.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I thought we were good and it was a really tight game. With minutes to go, we're thinking we can get a deserved equaliser.\n\"To come here and create the number of chances we did is a really positive thing.\n\"We are a football team and high-pressing team. We tried to show that while trying to get a result. I thought the players did it superbly at times.\n\"We should have had two penalties added to the mix and it could have been very different.\"\nKey stats - Bournemouth end their Arsenal drought\nCallum Wilson's goal was Bournemouth's first against Arsenal in any competition.\nThe Gunners have conceded a penalty in consecutive home games for the first time in the Premier League.\nArsenal have had seven shots on target in their past four games in all competitions, and have scored seven goals.\nOnly Crystal Palace (eight) have scored more headed goals than Arsenal (six) in the Premier League this season.\nOlivier Giroud has been involved in more goals from the bench than any other Premier League player this season (three goals, one assist).\nWilson's goal was his ninth in the Premier League - more than any other Bournemouth player.\nWhat next?\nArsenal are in action on Wednesday when they host Southampton in an EFL Cup quarter-final at 19:45 GMT, while Bournemouth's next game takes them to Liverpool for a 13:30 GMT kick-off on Sunday, 4 December."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 West Ham United\nJose Mourinho was sent off for a second time in a month as his Manchester United side drew against West Ham at Old Trafford.\nThe Portuguese boss kicked a water bottle in reaction to referee Jon Moss showing Paul Pogba a yellow card for diving. Replays showed West Ham's Mark Noble did not make contact with the France midfielder.\nMourinho, sent off by Mark Clattenburg during last month's 0-0 draw at home to Burnley, got his marching orders from the official moments later.\nMoss also dismissed him in October 2015, when Mourinho was in charge of Chelsea - again during a match against West Ham.\nThe drama came after two goals were scored in the opening quarter of the match.\nWest Ham took the lead in the second minute when Diafra Sakho headed in from Dimitri Payet's free-kick. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was partly at fault for the goal but made amends in the 21st minute when he nodded in from Pogba's dinked delivery.\nThe hosts were thwarted on several occasions by Hammers goalkeeper Darren Randolph, while Jesse Lingard had the ball in the net for the home side but it was correctly ruled out for offside.\nAnalysis: Why Man Utd's title hopes are over\nMourinho 'will get it right at Man Utd'\nRelive the action from Old Trafford\nIll-discipline costs Mourinho again\nMourinho is becoming a familiar figure in the stands after red mist descended for the second time in a matter of weeks.\nEarlier this month he was banned and fined for an incident in the tunnel at half-time during the match against Burnley, and in a separate case was fined \u00a350,000 for comments made about referee Anthony Taylor before United's match with Liverpool.\nBoth incidents came a year after Mourinho served a one-match stadium ban for an abusive rant at Moss at half-time during a Chelsea Premier League match at Upton Park.\nHe was also fined \u00a350,000 for saying that referees were afraid to award Chelsea penalties during their 3-1 defeat by Southampton in October 2015.\nMan Utd fall further away\nAny feelings of euphoria that Manchester United had following Thursday's 4-0 Europa League win over Feyenoord will have disappeared after this result.\nMourinho's men are 11 points shy of leaders Chelsea following their fifth draw in seven league matches. In that period, they have only won one game.\nOn Sunday, they were thwarted by the brilliance of Randolph. The goalkeeper - playing only his second league game of the season - twice blocked from Ibrahimovic and made instinctive saves to deny Marcus Rashford and Lingard.\nHe also pushed a Henrikh Mkhitaryan shot on to the post - the follow-up was tapped into the net by the offside Lingard.\nWhen Randolph was rounded by Ibrahimovic after an awful James Collins backpass, Cheikhou Kouyate was on hand to hook the ball clear of danger.\nMan of the match - Darren Randolph (West Ham)\n'It should be a foul for us'\nManchester United assistant manager Rui Faria speaking to BBC Sport about Mourinho's sending-off: \"The referee explained it to Jose and there is nothing more to say. I think there was frustration from Jose after the yellow card for Pogba. It should be a foul for us but the referee understood it in another way.\n\"I don't take over. I follow the normal procedure. The boss is Jose all the time and he passes on what is the best for the team and we just try to make it happen without having him there.\"\nOn the match: \"We did more than enough to win the game in a comfortable way.\n\"We didn't and the reality is that we are playing well. The team is doing what we ask. We create the opportunities but we are not scoring the goals and we are suffering because we want to win the matches.\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"It might have been more but it is a great point for us, especially as we played well. I have to praise the players, who showed character, commitment and quality, especially in the second half.\n\"In the first half, when we scored, we were a little bit afraid because we were winning at Old Trafford and then until they scored we lost too many balls.\n\"In the second half, we told the players to go up on them and I was very pleased with how we played. You can't attack here all the time.\n\"They tried to press when they lost the ball and if you get out of that, there is a lot of space. We were using that really well in the second half.\"\nPogba provides first Man Utd assist\nDiafra Sakho's goal is the second quickest Manchester United have conceded at Old Trafford in the Premier League.\nThe West Ham forward has scored three times in four Premier League games against United, and in both games contested at Old Trafford.\nZlatan Ibrahimovic has scored in consecutive league games for the first time since his first two appearances in the competition.\nPaul Pogba provided his first assist in the Premier League, in his 15th appearance.\nWhat's next?\nManchester United face West Ham at Old Trafford again in the EFL Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday and are back in league action at Everton next Sunday. After their cup tie, the Hammers will be at home to Arsenal next Saturday."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-0 Everton\nCharlie Austin scored after just 41 seconds to earn Southampton a first win in five Premier League games as Everton boss Ronald Koeman had an unhappy return to St Mary's Stadium.\nEverton had hardly touched the ball when Austin headed home from point-blank range after an assist from 19-year-old debutant Josh Sims.\nKoeman, who was given a mixed reception on his return to the club he left in June, saw his side miss numerous chances to equalise.\nThe best fell to Idrissa Gueye, but the former Aston Villa midfielder shot over after Seamus Coleman's cut-back.\nThe win lifts Southampton up to 10th in the Premier League, two points behind seventh-placed Everton.\nRead more: Koeman 'worried' by Everton displays\nRelive the action from Sunday's Premier League games\nOne shot on target for toothless Everton\nDefeat means Everton have won once in eight Premier League games, with Koeman's honeymoon period well and truly over.\nIn an entertaining game, his side created enough to ensure his return to the club he successfully managed for two seasons would be fruitful.\nBut Everton tested Saints keeper Fraser Forster just once - a tame 93rd-minute shot by Gareth Barry.\nAs well as Gueye's wild miss, Barry and Ross Barkley headed great chances over while Yannick Bolasie wasted a further two opportunities in a game during which striker Romelu Lukaku, despite playing the full 90 minutes, had just 35 touches.\nIt could have been worse for the visitors. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the outside of the Everton post after the interval, while Maarten Stekelenburg brilliantly kept out Austin's flying header and Phil Jagielka cleared off the line from James Ward-Prowse.\nIt does not get any easier for Koeman. Three of their next four league games are at home to Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.\nHave the Saints found a star in the making?\nSaints boss Claude Puel sprang a major surprise by naming teenage forward Sims in the side ahead of experienced attacking options Shane Long and Jay Rodriguez.\nSims was selected after impressing for the under-23 side, and the England youth international grasped his chance with a mature and confident display.\nHe had already had a shot charged down when he lifted the ball into the path of Austin to open the scoring as some fans were still taking their seats.\nSims used his pace to cause Everton's defence problems and, in a display which augurs well for Southampton's future, tested Stekelenburg with a header and a shot from distance.\nHe also ensured Leighton Baines left with a bruise or two after an over-enthusiastic challenge, before receiving a standing ovation when he was replaced six minutes from the end.\nMan of the match - Charlie Austin (Southampton)\n'A pleasure to watch'\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"It was a very good performance for us because we had a lot of injury problems before the match.\n\"It was a good game against a good team, it had lovely action and I took pleasure from our chances - it's interesting for the future.\n\"Josh Sims - for his first Premier League game, I guess it's OK! I am happy for him and the team. He showed very good progress with the under-23s and I thought it would be a good opportunity for him.\n\"I think it's important to respect the academy here and when we have problems with injuries it's fantastic to be able to start players from the academy.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Our start was really poor because even the kick-off was ours and we lost the ball too fast.\n\"I can't complain about our second half but if you don't score, you can't win.\n\"I wasn't aware of Josh Sims when I was here and he is not my problem - I work for Everton, not Southampton.\"\n'Travel sick Everton'\nThe Toffees have lost four of their past five league games away from home, including conceding seven consecutive goals without reply and are on a run of three successive losses.\nSouthampton have kept 13 clean sheets against Everton in the Premier League - three more than any other side the Saints have faced.\nJosh Sims is the sixth Southampton player to provide an assist on his Premier League debut. He is the youngest at 19 years and 244 days old.\nIt took Everton 92 minutes and 21 seconds to have their first shot on target.\nWhat's next?\nAfter playing in the Europa League last Thursday and the Premier League on Sunday, Southampton now turn their attention to Wednesday's EFL Cup quarter-final at Arsenal (19:45 GMT). Everton have a full week to prepare for Manchester United's visit to Goodison Park next Sunday (16:00 GMT).\nReaction"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-3 Chelsea\nChelsea's eighth successive Premier League win cemented their place at the top of the table - but their victory at Etihad Stadium ended in chaos as Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Fernandinho were sent off in injury time.\nAntonio Conte's side delivered an impressive statement of intent as they cut City apart on the break after going behind to Gary Cahill's own goal on the stroke of half-time, when he diverted Jesus Navas' cross beyond keeper Thibaut Courtois.\nThe game turned on Kevin de Bruyne's 56th-minute miss with City in control, crashing Navas' cross against the bar from inside the six-yard box.\nChelsea were level on the hour when Diego Costa outmuscled Nicolas Otamendi to score and they were ahead 10 minutes later when substitute Willian raced clear to beat City keeper Claudio Bravo with ease.\nEden Hazard completed a magnificent win for Chelsea with another goal on the break, showing too much pace for Aleksandar Kolarov to wrap up three vital points.\nAnswers from Conte; questions for Guardiola\nGuardiola apologises after mass brawl\nClinical Chelsea punished Man City - Waddle\nChelsea send powerful message\nChelsea's renaissance since a 3-0 loss at Arsenal in September left them in eighth place, eight points behind then leaders City, has been hugely impressive - but this is their most powerful statement of the season.\nEight wins from eight and only two goals conceded tells the story and this win against City was the second week in succession they have come from behind to beat a team that could be regarded as realistic title rivals after overcoming Tottenham at Stamford Bridge last weekend.\nThey were tested by periods of City domination, but showed a ruthlessness to match their steely resilience and tore Pep Guardiola's side to shreds in the closing 20 minutes.\nConte's switch to a three-man defensive system and the rejuvenation of key men such as Costa and Hazard is making this Chelsea side resemble the full title package.\nGuardiola's defensive chaos\nManchester City have kept one clean sheet at home in the Premier League this season - in the 4-0 win against Bournemouth - and on this evidence it is easy to see why.\nFor all City's domination of possession and creation, Guardiola's side have an Achilles heel at the back that was ruthlessly exposed here.\nYes, De Bruyne should have put the game out of Chelsea's reach but City's defence offered the visitors hope throughout - and how they capitalised when given the chance.\nGuardiola has been linked with defensive reinforcements, particularly Southampton's Virgil van Dijk, and the manner in which they were dismantled here now makes this a matter of urgency.\nThe jitters started early when John Stones was caught in possession in his own area, while defensive partner Nicolas Otamendi had a nightmare afternoon and was culpable for Chelsea's first two goals from Costa, where he was weak in the challenge, and Willian.\nGuardiola gestured in despair towards his central defenders after Willian's goal - his displeasure will surely take the form of more decisive action in January.\nAn unsavoury end\nIt is unlikely either Manchester City or Chelsea have heard the last of a shameful conclusion to a high-class game of football as players and officials from both sides became embroiled in ugly scenes.\nCity's frustration at what they believed were a series of injustices at the hands of referee Anthony Taylor boiled over in injury time as Aguero caught Luiz high and late, which happened after the Argentina striker clashed with the defender at a corner earlier.\nChelsea's Nathaniel Chalobah joined in and was lucky not to see red, while Fernandinho was sent off for grabbing Cesc Fabregas.\nEven then, Fernandinho had to be forced to leave the pitch and with the whole situation threatening to go completely out of control, it was fortunate referee Taylor was able to blow the final whistle seconds later.\nIt is hard to see how both clubs can escape censure for a failure to control their players.\nMan of the match: Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nChelsea win eighth game in a row - the stats\nChelsea have won eight consecutive Premier League games for the first time since the 2006-07 season, when they won nine in the row during Jose Mourinho's first spell as manager.\nManchester City lost a Premier League home game that they have been leading for the first time since April 2009 (1-3 v Fulham).\nSince the start of 2013-14, Chelsea striker Diego Costa has scored 70 goals in 103 league appearances (Premier League and La Liga combined).\nCity have kept a clean sheet in just two of their 14 Premier League games under Pep Guardiola.\nManchester City made six changes to their starting XI from their previous Premier League game (v Burnley) - they have made 46 starting XI changes overall this season, more than any other club.\nWhat they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola on Sky Sports: \"Congratulations to Chelsea - they won. We played really good, had a lot of control and created chances - but the ball in the box was not strong enough.\n\"Chelsea's approach was really different but that is part of the game. You don't expect Chelsea to create 25 chances - they created three and scored three.\"\nWhen asked about Aguero's challenge on Luiz at the end of the game, Guardiola added: \"Both players were strong there - that's all.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte on Sky Sports: \"Today was very tough and the game was open until the end. There were lots of chances for both teams to score.\n\"I saw lots of character from my team and that's very important to grow - but we must continue to work and improve.\"\nSpeaking about Costa's role as peace keeper at the end of the game, he added: \"Diego is showing he is using his passion in the right way and I'm very happy about that.\"\nJason Roberts, former West Brom striker, on Final Score: \"Chelsea were incredible. They went behind but they kept their heads. I think Pep got it wrong and I think Conte got everything right.\n\"The performances from Willian, from Costa, from Fabregas - who came on and showed he has that bit of guile. This is the best game I've seen this season.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester City have a home game against Celtic in the Champions League on Tuesday (19:45 GMT kick-off), followed by a Premier League trip to Leicester City on 10 December (17:30).\nChelsea's next game is a home match against West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on 11 December at 12:00 GMT."

I think the starting point was Tottenham got to every ball faster. On a day like today it feels like we have a long, long way to go.\n\"There have been other days where I think there have been promising signs. We have work to do. We knew coming here today was going to be particularly difficult. We have to learn from it but go forward quickly.\"\nSpurs' record continues...\nTottenham have a 100% record against Swansea at White Hart Lane, winning all six games - their best record against any club they have played four times or more.\nThe result is Swansea's joint worst in Premier League history, also losing 5-0 to Chelsea (January 2015) and Liverpool (February 2013).\nTottenham have won by a five-goal margin in the Premier League for the first time since hitting five past Newcastle at White Hart Lane in February 2012.\nAfter scoring five goals last weekend, Swansea recorded just one shot against Spurs, their worst shot tally in a Premier League match.\nHarry Kane has now scored 21 goals in 28 Premier League appearances in 2016 - only Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (27) has more goals this year.\nAnalysis\nFormer Spurs & England forward Clive Allen at White Hart Lane for BBC Radio 5 live sports extra\n\"This could have been double figures with the chances Spurs created in the second half. There was a catalogue of errors from Swansea. It was an emphatic victory for the home side.\"\nWhat's next?\nSwansea are at home to Sunderland in a 15:00 GMT kick-off in the Premier League on Saturday.\nSpurs play CSKA Moscow in the Champions League at Wembley on Wednesday - a draw will secure a Europa League place - before travelling to Manchester United in a 14:15 kick-of on Sunday."

The discipline was good.\n\"When the pressure racks up in the Premier League it's hard but we got the balance right and we had some good attacking play.\n\"When you've been manager at Newcastle and the whole town lives and breathes football, you have to be able to cope with pressure. The pressure sometimes there was intense. It wasn't as bad this week.\"\nAbout the thumbs up he gave his chairman Steve Parish, Pardew added: \"We have a lot of serious investors at the club who perhaps don't know a lot about football so the chairman has been defending me this week, so I just wanted to say thanks.\"\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"It is frustrating because it was a good opportunity for us to stay in the top half of the table. The first-half performance was not sufficient. We just played for the last five minutes.\n\"We tried to play in the second half with good movement and we created chances, but it was not enough to win the game. We did not keep good concentration. It was a bad day.\"\nOn Fraser Forster's error for the first goal, Puel added: \"Perhaps it was bad luck but it happens. The pitch today was bad but it is not an excuse.\"\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace do not have another game until next Saturday, when they play away at struggling Hull City.\nThe games come thick and fast for Southampton as they take on Hapoel Be'er Sheva at home in the Europa League on Thursday, before playing Middlesbrough at home in the Premier League the following Sunday."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 3-1 Watford\nWest Brom moved up to sixth in the Premier League after securing a third win in four league games with victory over Watford at The Hawthorns.\nCentral defender Jonny Evans headed in a Chris Brunt corner to put the Baggies in front with his first goal of the season.\nThe influential Brunt added a second when his low, left-footed strike from 25 yards went in via a deflection off Watford defender Juan Zuniga.\nWatford pulled one back when Christian Kabasele sidefooted in from close range before Baggies keeper Ben Foster crucially saved from Roberto Pereyra.\nPereyra was then dismissed late on when he reacted angrily to a James McClean challenge in an incident which resulted in both sets of players clashing on the touchline.\nMatt Phillips curled in a stoppage-time goal for the home side as West Brom moved ahead of Manchester United, who travel to Everton on Sunday, on goals scored.\nRelive West Brom v Watford\nFollow the latest from Saturday's games here\nMelee ruins Watford chances\nJust before Pereyra's 84th-minute dismissal, Watford had the Baggies defence under pressure and had forced the Midlands side into some last-ditch defending.\nWatford had 18 shots on goal compared to 11 for West Brom, with four efforts on target in the second half compared to one from their rivals.\nPereyra had gone close to a leveller when he was played through on goal only for keeper Ben Foster to save at the midfielder's feet.\nFoster also dived low to palm the ball away from Stefano Okaka in the box, with the Hornets striker unsuccessfully appealing for a penalty.\nMoments later, Pereyra ended his side's hopes of getting anything from the game when he shoved McClean in scenes that led to Watford boss Walter Mazzarri coming on to the field to restrain his player.\nPlayers from both camps also clashed before Pereyra was shown a red card and McClean a yellow.\nSet-piece masters\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis has built a reputation on being a professor of set-piece situations and he is only emphasising that at West Brom.\nEvans' opener was the Baggies' seventh goal from a corner this season - a league high - while it was the eighth Watford had conceded from such a set-piece, which is is the worst record in the Premier League.\nThe home side's second came from a free-kick when Phillips ran over the ball and James Morrison rolled it into the path of Brunt, who was helped by a deflection off Zuniga taking it past keeper Heurelho Gomes.\nPhillips' lovely goal put the icing on the win and the only negative for the Midlands club was the number of empty seats at the ground, with 22,244 in attendance at the 26,850-capacity stadium.\n\"Confidence is running through the side at the moment and we played some good stuff,\" Phillips said.\n\"We work very hard on set-pieces. Our job is to get the ball into the box and we know we have got players who can score.\"\nMan of the match - Chris Brunt\nWhat they said:\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"It was tough. Watford are very strong physically. We have had to stand up for ourselves.\n\"I'm more disappointed with the one we conceded from a set-piece than the one we scored. They went zonal today.\"\nOn the players' melee: \"I was more concerned about James McClean getting involved in it. Trouble seems to follow him around. I was more concerned with keeping him out of trouble as much as possible.\n\"The lad [Roberto Pereyra] has kicked out. Whether you catch him or not, it is the intent.\n\"We have a good spirit here. They are playing well. I am very pleased with Matty Phillips today. In a lot of areas we have had to grind it out and still created good opportunities.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"I'm very happy with how my team played. I think it is the best they have played since I have been here and we deserved victory.\n\"Pereyra was fouled. He was on the floor and his rival kept fouling him. He stood up and gave a small push and that's when I went to separate them. He was unfairly sent off.\n\"Of course, the game changed from there.\"\nKey stats - Brunt ends long wait\nWatford have won just one of their last nine league visits to The Hawthorns (D3 L5).\nChris Brunt ended a run of 29 Premier League appearances without a goal, netting his first in the competition since May 2015.\nJonny Evans has ended on the winning side on each of the six occasions he has scored in the Premier League.\nMatt Phillips has had a hand in six goals in his last four Premier League appearances (three goals, three assists).\nWest Brom have scored 20 goals in their 14 Premier League games so far this season - only in 2012-13 (24) have they scored more at this stage.\nWhat next?\nWatford, who are 10th in the table, host Everton at 12:30 GMT on Saturday, 10 December, while West Brom travel to Chelsea for a 12:00 GMT kick-off on Sunday, 11 December."

That's an important part of the Premier League and, even though that's difficult, there were clear signs today that was a team that went to win a game.\n\"We haven't shown that much away from home, but we did today and I thought the mentality was clear and some of the football was good.\n\"We just have to keep believing we will get our rewards if we keep performing like that.\"\nKey stats - Walters makes it 40\nStoke striker Jonathan Walters scored his first Premier League goal in 15 appearances\n28 of Walters' 40 Premier League goals have been scored at home (70%)\nAfter taking only one point in their first five league games this season, Stoke have lost only one of their last nine\nBurnley have scored only five goals in their past 15 away league games and never more than once in a match in this run\nThe Clarets have afforded their opponents more shots on target than any other side in the Premier League this term (91)\nBurnley have allowed their opponents more possession in 13 of their 14 league matches this season - they had 43.2% today\nWhat next?\nStoke City travel to Arsenal, who have not lost at home since the opening day of the season, on Saturday 10 December, when Burnley host Bournemouth at Turf Moor.

        "article_text": "Sunderland 2-1 Leicester City\nSunderland moved off the bottom of the table by beating reigning Premier League champions Leicester - their third win in four matches.\nThe Black Cats took the lead when Robert Huth turned a corner into his own net midway through the second half.\nAnd before Leicester could mount a response, David Moyes' side added a second when Jermain Defoe drove in after Duncan Watmore's shot was blocked.\nSubstitute Shinji Okazaki flicked Demarai Gray's cross in at the near post to set up a tense finish, but Sunderland held on.\nThe result moves them up to 18th and within two points of the Foxes, who are yet to win away in the league this season.\nLeicester are in real danger of becoming involved in a relegation battle and their return of 13 points is the worst record after 14 games of any defending champions in Premier League history.\nRelive Sunderland's win over Leicester\nEverything wrong at Leicester - Ranieri\nFalse dawn or a genuine revival?\nTwo wins from their three games prior to the visit of Leicester had given Sunderland fans some hope that their side have turned the corner under Moyes.\nThey lost in their previous outing - a 2-0 defeat at Liverpool after which Reds boss Jurgen Klopp said the Black Cats were the most defensive team he had ever seen.\nHowever, they looked nothing of the sort against Leicester, attacking with pace and intent. Victor Anichebe - reborn under Moyes - has forged an impressive partnership with Defoe and the continuation of that will be crucial to Sunderland's hopes of climbing out of the relegation zone.\nAnd the club's players also appear to have developed a strong team spirit, something that was exemplified in the final few seconds of the game as they threw themselves in front of the ball in a tense scramble before Jordan Pickford superbly punched away Wes Morgan's goal-bound shot.\nPause button pressed on Vardy fairytale\nThis time last year, Vardy was being congratulated on social media by Ruud van Nistelrooy for breaking the Dutchman's record of scoring in 10 consecutive Premier League games.\nFast forward to today and the striker's form has dipped dramatically - his blank against Sunderland was his 16th game for Leicester without scoring.\nVardy got into good positions against the Black Cats. He was unlucky with a clever cushioned header that landed on the roof of the net and also nodded just wide from dangerous Marc Albrighton cross. However, the England international is not getting the service he enjoyed in an electric 2015-16 campaign.\nDuring Leicester's title-winning season he linked up superbly with Riyad Mahrez, but the pair have rarely been on the same wavelength this season. Mahrez has found Vardy with just three passes in their past nine games and only once did the two combine against Sunderland.\nThere were suggestions\n, external\nthat Ranieri was considering dropping Vardy for the Sunderland game and another match without scoring may increase the threat to his place in the side.\nMan of the match - Victor Anichebe\nWhat they said\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"If we can win another three out of four we will be in a really good position. We are playing better and the team is getting better.\n\"We're much more of an attacking looking side now. We have got more options to attack and we have actually started to defend better.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"We did our best today, but it wasn't enough. We have to keep working hard in training and trust the bad moment will turn.\n\"From the own goal you can see the luck is not with us - but we have to stay compact, stay together and react strongly.\"\nIllustrious company for Defoe\nSunderland claimed a Premier League victory against Leicester City for the first time since April 2002, also a 2-1 home win.\nThe Black Cats had 22 shots in the match - they have not recorded more in a single league game since hitting 24 shots against in April 2014 versus Everton.\nThe Foxes have lost six of their past seven Premier League away games, conceding 18 goals and never scoring more than once in a game during this run.\nDefoe has scored five goals in his past five appearances at the Stadium of Light, including a goal in each of his past three games there.\nThe striker has scored 24 Premier League goals in December, only Alan Shearer (39), Robbie Fowler (33) and Wayne Rooney (31) have more.\nWhat next?\nIt is a big game at the bottom of the table for Sunderland as they head to Swansea on 10 December (15:00 GMT kick-off).\nLeicester, meanwhile, travel to Portugal to play Porto in their final Champions League group game on Wednesday (19:45). The Foxes are already through the knockout stage, so their focus is more likely to be on next Saturday's home game against Manchester City (17:30)."

Each of his three goals were superbly taken but it was the final, hat-trick goal that will live longest in the memory.\nPlayed through by Oxlade-Chamberlain, he feigned a dummy shot to fool already defeated Hammers keeper Randolph before delicately lifting the ball into the net for what must be one of the goals of the season so far.\n'A big humiliation'\nWest Ham were certainly not helped by losing James Collins to injury in the game's early stages, and his replacement Alvaro Arbeloa looked off the pace.\nBut regardless of ill fortune, the Hammers remain without a win in the league since their home victory over Sunderland on 22 October.\nManager Slaven Bilic said this result, coming after Wednesday's 4-1 defeat by Manchester United in the EFL Cup, was \"a big humiliation\", and the fact that his players faded after Sanchez increased Arsenal's lead will be another cause for concern.\nA win for Hull in their match at Middlesbrough on Monday will send West Ham into the bottom three.\nI feel under pressure - Bilic\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\nWhat they said\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic on BT Sport: \"I am not looking for excuses. Yes, we had injuries and mistakes, but we were not good enough.\n\"It was a big humiliation. I feel sorry for the fans and the club. We played some good games in this season, and had some good moments today even at 0-0 and 1-0 down.\n\"But I have to be honest and say we don't have the intensity and from the dedication comes the quality. We don't have it the same as last season, even in training.\n\"We are in a serious situation before this game which we don't like. The players know that, but it's not only about knowing but sacrificing, and your dedication for the game.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We had a convincing performance and strong result.\n\"We created many chances and you could see West Ham are not a confident team at home. On top of that we had a strong performance.\n\"Alexis Sanchez - it took him a while mentally to get into the game, but he can always give you something special. He's a fighter and a classy player. You don't find many players like him. He can always surprise you. He also has great technique as well.\n\"I believe we are on a strong run and it's down to us to be mentally ready to maintain that run.\"\nThe stats behind Sanchez's season\nThere were 14 minutes and 29 seconds between the first and third goals of Alexis Sanchez's hat-trick\nSanchez has been directly involved in six of Arsenal's past eight Premier League goals (five goals, one assist)\nHis tally for the season is 13 goals and nine assists from 19 matches in all competitions\nNo player has received more yellow cards this Premier League season than Winston Reid, with six\nOzil has equalled his Premier League goal tally of last season with eight goals\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Liverpool for a 16:30 GMT kick-off in the Premier League on Sunday, 11 December.\nArsenal play away to Swiss club Basel in the Champions League on Tuesday, before welcoming Stoke in the Premier League at 15:00 next Saturday."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 4-3 Liverpool\nBournemouth completed one of the comebacks of the season to beat Liverpool for the first time in a sensational Premier League game.\nThe Cherries battled back from 2-0 down at half-time and 3-1 behind with 15 minutes to go, with Nathan Ake's 93rd-minute winner sealing a famous win.\nSadio Mane scored the Reds' opener when he controlled Emre Can's ball over the top, held off Ake and poked home.\nThe visitors looked in control when Divock Origi went past Artur Boruc and curled home their second from a narrow angle.\nBournemouth brought on Ryan Fraser in the 55th minute and that proved to be the turning point of the game. Seconds later James Milner brought him down in the area and Callum Wilson scored the penalty.\nCan put the Reds 3-1 up with a 20-yard curling effort but Fraser scored his first Premier League goal when he tucked home after Wilson's cross had hit the heels of Benik Afobe.\nCentre-back Steve Cook got Bournemouth level when he controlled Fraser's cross, swivelled and volleyed home.\nIt looked like the drama was over until the third minute of injury time when Loris Karius spilled Cook's shot and Ake tapped home into an empty net.\nHowe: Cherries showed Championship spirit\nBournemouth showed 'fighting spirit' in win over Liverpool - Hartson\nHow the comeback unfolded\n20 mins (0-1): Liverpool open the scoring through Mane, who pokes the ball past Boruc\n22 mins (0-2): Surely game over already, as Mane wins the ball off Harry Arter and finds Jordan Henderson, who plays in Origi, with the Belgian guiding the ball into an empty net after Boruc came flying out of his box\n45 mins: At half-time, Liverpool are cruising and look set to make it 12 Premier League games unbeaten\n56 mins (1-2): Bournemouth are back in this, as Fraser takes the ball past Milner with his first touch and gets brought down. Wilson sends Karius the wrong way from the spot\n64 mins (1-3): The threat of a comeback is short-lived, as Mane takes the ball off Ake and pulls it back to Can to curl home. Five minutes later, Mane comes off with the job seemingly done\n72 mins: Liverpool are inches away from going 4-1 up, as Boruc holds Milner's corner, but almost takes it back past his line. Goal-line technology shows it was millimetres from being 100% across the line.\n76 mins (2-3): Fraser gets Bournemouth back in it, as he converts Wilson's cross, which had been mis-controlled into his path by Afobe\n78 mins (3-3): Cook scores a brilliant goal, as he takes the ball with his back to goal, before turning and smashing home\n90 mins: Origi almost wins it for Liverpool, but he fires over from close range\n90+3 mins (4-3): Absolute scenes. Bournemouth win it as Karius makes a total mess of Cook's shot and Ake has an open net to tap into\nHowe for England?\nBefore the game, Football Association panel member Howard Wilkinson told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek that Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe had been considered for the England job.\nResults like this will do nothing to harm his chances when newly appointed Gareth Southgate eventually goes, although that is if Howe is not too successful for international management next time it comes around.\nHaving said that, he could not have imagined his introduction of Fraser, an uncapped 22-year-old Scottish winger, early in the second half could have worked out so well.\nThe Cherries could have been forgiven for crumbling when they went 2-0, and especially 3-1, down. History was not on their side.\nIn all previous nine games against the Reds, stretching back to 1927, they had drawn two - in the FA Cup in 1927 and 1968 - and lost the other seven, including the replays to those games.\nBut they never gave up, and move into the top half of the table with these three points.\nLiverpool implosion will be demoralising blow\nThe Reds were looking for a victory which would make it 12 league games unbeaten and equal their best start to a Premier League season.\nIt would also have taken them second, one point behind leaders Chelsea, the parent club of match-winner Ake.\nAnd midway through the second half, it appeared the story of the game was going to be a good performance and deserved win for Liverpool.\nManager Jurgen Klopp, who is without injured forward Philippe Coutinho for several weeks, admitted his side had thrown it away.\nOne boost was Adam Lallana's return from three weeks out with a groin injury, although he replaced Mane just before the start of the implosion that has left them four points off in-form Chelsea.\nMake that 23 from 1,062...\nMan of the match: Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth)\nLiverpool blow a two-goal lead again: Match stats\nThe Cherries recovered a two-goal deficit to win a Premier League match for the first time.\nThe last two occasions of a losing side being two goals ahead at half-time in a Premier League match now involve Liverpool losing to a South Coast club (also 2-3 v Southampton in March 2016).\nOnly two players have scored more goals in their opening 13 Premier League games for Liverpool than Mane (7) - Robbie Fowler (8) and Daniel Sturridge (10).\nThe Reds have netted 19 first-half Premier League goals this season, three more than any other side.\nCallum Wilson has scored in five of his nine Premier League starts at the Vitality Stadium for Bournemouth (five goals).\nThis was the fourth time under Klopp that Liverpool have been two goals ahead in a Premier League game and failed to win (2-2 v Sunderland, 2-3 v Southampton and 2-2 v Newcastle).\nRyan Fraser is just the third Premier League player this season to score and assist in a game as a substitute (Shaun Maloney and Robert Snodgrass for Hull are the others).\nUnder Klopp, Liverpool have kept just four clean sheets in 23 away Premier League games, conceding 38 goals.\nLiverpool lost a Premier League match 4-3 for the first time since November 2000 against Leeds United.\n'We are not ice skating'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"We opened the door and they ran through and scored some wonderful goals. So that's the deserved result.\n\"It doesn't feel too good right now but sometimes we need it. Of course this can help us. No road is without rocks and stones.\n\"It's three points, no more. You cannot be champions in December.\n\"We are not ice skating, it's not about how it looks. I know we can play football. Nothing is decided at 2-0. The boys know now we gave it away - only because of us Bournemouth came back. It was our mistake to let them back in the game.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It was a great game, obviously from our perspective because we won. Liverpool were excellent in the first half and we knew their quality. It took our substitutes to make an impact and liven us up. Ryan Fraser deserved that opportunity today.\n\"It would have been easy for our players to give up and see out time, but our group knows not to give up. We scored at the right time, and the easy thing when you equalise is to sit back and defend that but thankfully the lads kept going.\n\"In the second half we looked like scoring every time we attacked. For this club and everyone involved, it's made for a very special day. These days are huge for us. We'd never been in the Premier League until last season so we're making history for the club.\"\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth are away to Burnley, whom Howe managed in between his two Cherries reigns, on Saturday (15:00 GMT) in the Premier League. Liverpool host struggling West Ham the next day (16:30 GMT)."

Lower points tally than Moyes\nUnited fail to see out the game - again\nUnited have now dropped seven points as a result of goals conceded in the final 10 minutes of league games this season - more than any other side.\nThat statistic contributed to United's tally of 20 points from 13 games at kick-off, their worst haul in the Premier League era.\nDespite their frustrations in the league, they were good value for their goal when it arrived towards the end of a largely listless first half.\nAnthony Martial's long ball forward was the cue for Stekelenburg to needlessly charge from his goal, giving Ibrahimovic an opportunity to score that he would not have had if the keeper had stayed at home.\nAs it was, Stekelenburg so nearly got away with it.\nIbrahimovic's effort bounced up and on to the bar, back down in front of the line and then spun sideways into the post.\nTime seemed to stand still as the ball dallied and danced on the line, but it finally crossed just as Ramiro Funes Mori ran in to hack clear.\nThe visitors were unlucky not to find themselves further ahead when Herrera struck the bar in the second half, after which Everton came more into the match as an attacking force, with Kevin Mirallas, Gueye and Enner Valencia all forcing David de Gea into action.\nUnited looked to have weathered the storm and for good measure threw on Fellaini to add extra steel at the back in what time remained - but the Belgian, signed from Everton for \u00a327.5m in 2013, suffered a rush of blood in his own box to gift the hosts a point.\nDogged Everton get their reward\nEverton's strong finish to the match was in stark contrast to an opening 45 minutes during which they managed no shots on target.\nAnd if there was any sense of injustice over Rojo's tackle on Gueye - which referee Oliver only deemed a caution - it did not translate itself to greater urgency in their play, despite their run of just one win in eight games at kick-off.\nBut as the game wore on, so Everton's threat increased.\nTheir flurry of shots after the break transformed De Gea from a mere bystander to a central figure in proceedings - with his first stop from Mirallas' powerful drive the pick of the bunch.\nFellaini's mistimed tackle on Gueye was lucky in a way but just reward in another, and after Baines planted the ball home to De Gea's right there was only one team in the running to take all the points.\nValencia saw a shot blocked within moments of the restart before Baines let fly from 20 yards with a fizzing drive that De Gea had to punch away to safety.\nMan of the match - Idrissa Gueye (Everton)\nStat attack - dead-eye Baines delivers again\nBaines has scored 17 of his 19 penalties in the Premier League (89.5%).\nOnly Phil Jagielka has given away more penalties this season (3) than Fellaini in the Premier League (2).\nAnthony Martial provided his first assist since getting two on the opening day of the season against Bournemouth.\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals from outside the box this season than Ibrahimovic (Xherdan Shaqiri and Philippe Coutinho also on 3).\nEverton have kept just one clean sheet in their last 10 Premier League fixtures (2-0 v West Ham).\nUnited have won just one of their last eight games in the Premier League, with six draws (L1), while Everton have won just one of their last nine league games (D4 L4).\n'We took risk'\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"We were the best team by far, but we didn't win. We had chances for a 2-0 and had the ball against the post and then we conceded a goal in the last minute.\n\"I notice my team trying always to play the 90 minutes in the same way, but that is not always possible because your opponent tries to react, which they did a little bit in the last 10 or 15 minutes.\n\"I am concerned because we don't get results we deserve.\n\"When my team is playing well the results are important. I am pleased my team is playing well. It is a problem that our position in the table is not a reflection of our performances.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"The whole team performance was positive and we showed great organisation from the start. We made it difficult for United to create anything.\n\"We went 1-0 down through a mistake which was disappointing, of course. One point was the minimum what we deserved.\n\"We made the subs and we took risk with four strikers on. David de Gea made one or two unbelievable saves and we could have scored earlier. It was a fair result. We're still unbeaten at home, so we are very happy.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United conclude their Europa League Group A campaign away to Ukraine's Zorya Luhansk on Thursday (18:00 GMT), before returning to Premier League action at home to Tottenham on Sunday (14:15). Everton's next outing is a league match at Watford on Saturday (12:30)."

It was much too little, much too late.\n\"I'm very fearful for Hull,\" said Lawrenson. \"Looking at them and what they have got I think they will go down.\"\nMan of the match - Gaston Ramirez\n'We have to keep our heads above water'\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"We deserved to win, we had a lot of chances and all of the possession. We were confident on the pitch and once we went ahead we had the experience to manage the game.\n\"Sometimes Gaston Ramirez will score, sometimes another player, but we won promotion to the Premier League by playing as a team and that is how we stay.\n\"We have 15 points - we must keep going and working together. We have to fight with the teams in the relegation positions because we are a newly promoted team. We have done nothing yet.\"\nHull boss Mike Phelan: \"We tried to drag something out of it but it was really, really disappointing. We gave away a ridiculous goal from a set-piece, we all have jobs to do and we didn't concentrate.\n\"We defended well at times and after they scored we came into it but we have to do better and not concede when we don't need to. We all understand the predicament we are in and hardship that we face but we have enough players to do certain jobs.\n\"We are short on the ground, we have added a couple, but we are where we are because of the beginning of the season. We have to keep our heads above water.\"\nBoro use their heads - the facts\nGaston Ramirez's goal was Middlesbrough's sixth headed goal of the season - only West Ham and Crystal Palace (eight each) have scored more in the Premier League.\nIndeed, only West Ham (53%) have scored a higher proportion of headed goals in the Premier League this season than Middlesbrough (46% - 6/13).\nHull are winless in their past nine away league games against Middlesbrough, since a 2-1 win in March 1986.\nThe Tigers have lost their past five Premier League away games - their worst run in the division since a run of six in April 2010.\nViktor Fischer mustered six shots in this game, the most by a Middlesbrough player in a single Premier League match this season.\nMiddlesbrough have won two of their past three Premier League home games - as many as they had won in their previous 18 at the Riverside in the division.\nWhat's next?\nHull welcome fellow strugglers Crystal Palace on Saturday, while Boro make the long trip to Southampton on Sunday."

Indeed it was epitomised by the hard-working Etienne Capoue, who covered 9.33km and gained possession back nine times - more than any other team-mate.\nCaptain Troy Deeney remains stuck on 99 club goals, though, and has now gone eight league matches without finding the net. He should have done better with a first-half effort he screwed wide.\nToffees unstuck at the back\nAfter a bright start to the season under Ronald Koeman, with four victories in their opening five games, Everton have fallen away and have won just one of their past 10.\nAnd problems in defence have seen them keep just two clean sheets in the league so far this season.\nAustrian defender Prodl gave their backline a warning when he headed over, but they did not respond and he soon found the net.\nLukaku did provide some cheer at the other end, and his header five minutes from time took his tally of goals to 12 in the league this season.\nBarry closes in on record\nVeteran Everton midfielder Barry has played in 609 top-flight games, moving him level with former England team-mate Frank Lampard.\nThe 35-year-old showed his class with a wonderful assist for Lukaku's opener and made more passes (62) and tackles (four) than any other player.\nIf the former Aston Villa and Manchester City man plays in Everton's remaining 23 league games this season, he will draw level with Ryan Giggs' Premier League record.\nMan of the match - Stefano Okaka (Watford)\n'A victory for the fans'\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri:\n\"I am really happy. Even though they managed to score with their first chance, we showed character to beat a very good team. I also want to thank the fans because they were incredible. When we were losing, they were still chanting for us.\"\n\"Stefano Okaka had to wait mainly because of injury but he has shown how important he is for the team.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman:\n\"I did not expect an easy job when we came to Everton.\"\n\"I know the expectations, I know the criticisms of the past few seasons. When I signed this contact I did not expect an easy job. I know the history of the club.\"\n\"The Premier League is not always about football quality, it's about physicality and winning second balls and in that aspect the team is too weak.\"\n\"We have difficulty against direct, aggressive teams. In that aspect we need to improve and do better and that's the big concern.\"\n\"You can't do that in two weeks, you need January and the summer. We need a better balance in our team.\"\nAnalysis - 'Koeman and fans will be worried'\nFormer Premier League goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on BBC Radio 5 live:\nWatford definitely deserved to win the game. Everton were well below standard and you can understand why they are in the run they are in.\nFor most of the game, Everton really didn't pose many threats. Looking at the run of games they have to come, Ronald Koeman and their fans will be extremely worried.\nEveryone chipping in for Watford\nWatford won against Everton for the first time in any competition since March 1987, following two draws and nine defeats.\nEverton have conceded 11 goals in their past four away games in the Premier League, including three or more on two occasions.\nRomelu Lukaku has been directly involved in 12 goals (nine scored, three assists) in the Premier League this season.\nAt the age of 23, Lukaku has scored against 22 of the 29 different opponents he has faced in the top flight.\nWatford have had 11 different goalscorers in the Premier League this season, a joint-high alongside Liverpool.\nStefano Okaka netted his first Premier League goal in 2,414 days; last scoring in May 2010 for Fulham against West Ham.\nEverton have now lost their past four Premier League away games, their worst such run in the competition since January 2015 (five defeats).\nWatford's Jose Holebas has provided three assists this season, a league-high for a defender alongside Bournemouth's Adam Smith.\nWhat next?\nWatford travel to face Manchester City in the league on Wednesday (kick-off 20:00 GMT), a day after Everton host Arsenal (19:45)."

He did not show the Swiss a yellow card.\nThe Gunners had already lost Shkodran Mustafi to injury, with the German later ruled out for at least three weeks. His replacement, Bellerin, had a superb game. The Spain right-back frequently drove forward and it was from his low cross that Walcott glanced the equaliser.\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain chipped a wonderful pass over the Stoke defence for Ozil to head his ninth league goal of the season, with Potters right-back Erik Pieters still running back having had to leave the pitch following treatment.\nIwobi, who scored in Basel, ensured Arsenal moved top ahead of Chelsea, having scored four more goals than the Blues. They are level on 34 points with a goal difference of +21.\nWill Arsenal have the mental and physical stamina to still be in that position come the end of the season?\n35 years and counting\nStoke were also in excellent form, winning five of their previous nine games and losing just one.\nThey had only conceded five times in that run but history was not in their favour, having lost their past 14 visits to Arsenal and not winning there since August 1981.\nMarc Muniesa went close with an early 30-yard volley before Adam sent Petr Cech the wrong way to mark his 31st birthday with his first goal of the season.\nTwice Stoke came close to scoring only for Arsenal to score almost immediately afterwards. Marko Arnautovic threatened to make it 2-0 after an excellent run in the Gunners' box but was crowded out just before Walcott's equaliser.\nMark Hughes' side increasingly found themselves on the back foot in the second half but came close to an equaliser when Peter Crouch was brought on for a corner and immediately headed down to force a smart, low save from Cech.\nWithin two minutes Iwobi made it 3-1 to put the game to bed.\nMan of the match - Hector Bellerin (Arsenal)\nMOTD analysis\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright: \"I can see Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's frustration. Last week he played well and he was very good again against Stoke.\n\"I do admire him a lot, but his chances are too far and few between for Arsenal. He's getting a lot further forward for the team, but with the emergence of Alex Iwobi it feels like he's not going to get the chance.\n\"I don't know what more he can do. It's up to the boss to give him a run, let him have a go. As soon as he does, he's always being taken off. Even when he plays well he still gets taken off.\"\nEx-England midfielder Danny Murphy: \"Granit Xhaka is talented, a super passer. I noticed his nasty streak in Euro 2016. He's ill-disciplined at times. It was a stupid foul. He was sent off earlier this season against Swansea for a reckless tackle. He's been sent off eight times in two and a half years. He won't get picked any more if he keeps doing that.\"\nWhat the managers said:\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We had a hesitant start, but when you play every few days sometimes it takes you time to get into a rhythm and that is what happened.\n\"We got a very unlucky penalty against us because it is not even a foul in my opinion. Mentally it was good for morale to get back to 1-1 before half-time.\n\"We are there for the fight and we have been consistent after the first game. It is down to us to maintain the focus and the desire to improve. We have a chance to fight at the top.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We created a number of good opportunities when in previous years we have struggled to even get shots on goal here.\n\"We stood up to them and maybe conceding the equaliser before half-time lifted them and hurt us more than we thought.\n\"We had to push the game and look for opportunities at the other end - a lot of teams will struggle to come here and cope with the pace and power Arsenal have at the moment. You have to take it on the chin and go again.\"\nThe stats you need to know\nIn Arsenal's 15 consecutive home wins against Stoke, the Gunners have scored 42 goals and conceded just eight\nNo player has hand a hand in more Premier League goals this season than Alexis Sanchez (11 goals, five assists)\nMark Hughes has lost all 10 of the away matches he has managed against Arsenal in the Premier League\nThe only English player with more Premier League goals than Theo Walcott (seven) this season is Jermain Defoe (eight)\nStoke have scored 14 of their past 15 penalties in the league, with their only failure coming from Bojan against Bournemouth last month\nArsenal have scored a league-high six goals from substitutes in the league this season\nHector Bellerin has assisted seven league goals since the start of last season, more than any other defender\nWhat's next?\nArsenal are away to Everton on Tuesday (19:45) before travelling to fourth-placed Manchester City on Sunday, 18 December (16:00).

What a goal,\" said Hartson on Final Score.\n\"Hendrick's strike is a contender for goal of the season for me, not just for the finish but for the way he plucks it out of the air.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC after the match, Hendrick was modest about his strike: \"Luckily, I got a good touch and it sat up nicely. I have been shooting in training all week, probably doing people's heads in, but if you don't shoot you won't score.\n\"It was nice to get one. I knew I had caught it well and had a chance, but you never know because the keeper can save it. Thankfully he didn't.\"\nMatch of the Day pundit Ian Wright said: \"The touch was super. A brilliant goal. I just love that. Aside from the goal, he showed a lot of desire and tenacity, winning the ball back for his team. He could've won a penalty. He should've got something.\"\nHome form key to Burnley campaign\nTurf Moor has become such a fortress this season that only Chelsea, with six wins, have won more home Premier League games than the Clarets' five this season.\nBurnley have now scored 14 league goals at Turf Moor this season, the same as they managed in their last top-flight season, and 16 of their 17 points have come at home.\nHendrick's effort was the perfect start for Burnley, who have struggled for goals this season. Prior to the match they had failed to score in a league-high seven matches and had scored the second fewest goals in the league.\nAnd, despite having only 30% possession, the three goals and three points move Sean Dyche's team up to 13th in the table.\nCherries comeback falls short\nBournemouth stunned Liverpool last week, coming back from 3-1 down to win 4-3, but there was to be no repeat at Turf Moor.\nEddie Howe started with Bournemouth player of the month for November Jack Wilshere on the bench, which he explained was to manage the on-loan Arsenal midfielder's workload.\nThey missed the 24-year-old's presence in the first half and appeared shell shocked after Burnley's two goals.\nAfobe's goal incensed Dyche, coming as it did in the 47th minute, after the fourth official had indicated one minute of added time.\nThe former Arsenal striker should have equalised two minutes after the break but dragged his shot so wide it went out for a throw-in.\nWilshere came on with 30 minutes to go and, while Bournemouth enjoyed almost 70% possession and made 548 passes - more than double Burnley's 243 - they struggled to test the home side.\nThey had just one shot on target in the second half - Daniels' goal - but the comeback came too late.\nMan of the match - Jeff Hendrick\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"I am very pleased. We are still learning as a side and we can definitely play better but the mentality was brilliant from my players.\n\"We had a bright start and threatened their back line which I think we did brilliantly.\n\"Let's not talk too much about the time-keeping, we could debate that all day but sometimes I don't know where they get the timing from. We've had it happen before where the referee seems to just let the time play out as if to give them a chance and lo-and-behold the ball ends up in our net. We can only hope it pays us back but it hasn't so far.\n\"Having said that I am super pleased with my subs today - I don't usually say something like that but they came on and changed the game and I thought they were outstanding.\n\"It's hard to kill teams off in the Premier League. The challenge is evident but there is clarity to the thoughts of the players and we will take that into the next matches. All we can do is work hard with the aim to get a result.\"\n'We gave ourselves a mountain to climb'\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"The most disappointing thing is we had given ourselves a mountain to climb going two goals down so early on, even though I felt like we controlled the game.\n\"Those two goals we can rue but we can't keep putting ourselves in the position where we have to chase the game like that.\n\"They put too many balls in our box but we got a lot of balls into their penalty area too but from our point of view there were too many wasted deliveries and bad decisions.\""

The players weren't happy but I've not seen it again.\"\nHull boss Mike Phelan was asked if Snodgrass had dived and said: \"The ref didn't feel that way, we take the penalty.\"\nDefensive problems continue, with tough challenges ahead\nAlthough a thrilling match for the supporters, the game highlighted the need for both managers to strengthen their defences when the January transfer window opens.\nHull have now conceded more goals than anyone in the division and only won once in 13 league games as they try to avoid an instant return to the Championship.\nTwo of their next three games are against Tottenham and Manchester City, while Palace, who have conceded 14 goals in their past four away matches, have to play Manchester United and then Chelsea.\nBoth managers have already said they hope to make signings next month and their hopes of staying in the top flight could depend on it.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\nA memorable day for Pardew\nHull scored as many goals on Saturday as they did in their previous six Premier League games combined.\nThere have been 36 goals scored in Crystal Palace's past seven Premier League games.\nCrystal Palace have scored more headed goals this season than any other Premier League team (nine).\nBenteke has now scored against 22 different Premier League teams.\nZaha has scored or assisted seven goals in his past seven Premier League appearances.\nSnodgrass has been directly involved in 50% of Hull's Premier League goals this season.\nThis match was Alan Pardew's 300th Premier League game as a manager, becoming the fifth English manager to reach this milestone after Harry Redknapp (641), Sam Allardyce (467), Steve Bruce (392) and Alan Curbishley (328).\nWhat they said\nHull City manager Mike Phelan said: \"I'm disappointed but also really proud of the way we played.\n\"We were on the front foot most of time, we were competitive - but when you score three at home and don't get a win, we should have seen it through.\n\"The last goal was a poor goal to concede, these things happen when you lose concentration.\n\"In January we need additions. The players want fresh faces, more energy, and we want to build on this squad.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"We made defensive errors, scored three away from home and still have not won.\n\"When Wilf got the second we really should be seeing that out from there. We score goals but we just need to tighten up.\n\"There was a magnificent performance from Wilf. He was sublime. They couldn't cope with him and that goal is a contender for goal of the season.\"\nMatch of the Day pundit Danny Murphy: \"Wilfried Zaha was brilliant, the best I've seen him. It looked like he had a point to prove. They couldn't cope with him from the first minute.\n\"The longer the game went on, the more influential he was. He did defensive work too. He scored a special goal. His crossing can let him down but he's obviously been working on it.\"\nEx-Palace striker Ian Wright on MOTD: \"Robert Snodgrass dived. He's just gone down. He's expecting Scott Dann to tackle him, but he's not tackled him.\n\"When you're under the kind of pressure Alan Pardew is under you need luck. Christian Benteke should have been awarded a penalty. Palace need the referees to do their bit.\"\nWhat's next\nBoth sides are next in Premier League action on Wednesday, with Hull away at Tottenham and Palace at home to Manchester United (both 20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 3-0 Sunderland\nSwansea City climbed off the bottom of the Premier League with a vital and comprehensive victory over fellow strugglers Sunderland.\nAfter an edgy goalless first half in sodden conditions, Gylfi Sigurdsson's calm penalty put the Swans ahead and eased the tension inside the Liberty Stadium.\nSigurdsson's clever corner set up Fernando Llorente for their second, and the Spaniard headed in a late third to give Bob Bradley a precious second win as manager.\nSwansea are now out of the relegation zone and up to 17th, while Sunderland replace them at the foot of the table.\nThe result is a setback for David Moyes' visitors, who had won three of their previous four matches.\nFor Swansea, meanwhile, a third victory of the season is a significant lift having endured their worst start to a season in any division since 1983.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nTurning point for Bradley?\nDespite being the newest appointment in the Premier League, Bradley was already under pressure having won only one of his first seven games in charge.\nThe American had said he was not concerned about his future but admitted this game was the most important of his tenure.\nBradley made five changes from Swansea's previous outing, a shambolic 5-0 thrashing at Tottenham, and his alterations were vindicated.\nThe Swans were calmer in possession with Angel Rangel at right-back and captain Leon Britton restored in midfield, while Llorente's recall gave their attack a much-needed focal point.\nThe hosts shaded an uneventful first half but it was not until the early stages of the second that they truly took control of the game, scoring two goals in a three-minute period which could prove to be a turning point in their season.\nAfter Sigurdsson's penalty gave Swansea the lead following Jason Denayer's handball, the Iceland midfielder was at the heart of the action moments later, as his low corner found Llorente, whose sweeping finish sparked ecstatic celebrations.\nSunderland bottom again\nSunderland had no answer to Swansea's rampant second-half display.\nThe visitors had seemed content to sit back and play for a draw in a tight first half and, although they were relatively untroubled at that point, they unravelled under pressure.\nAfter falling behind, Moyes' men looked panicked in defence and could barely muster a counter-attack in response.\nHaving scored eight of Sunderland's 14 Premier League goals this season, it was no wonder Jermain Defoe was identified by Bradley as the visitors' most potent threat.\nThe 34-year-old scored a hat-trick when Sunderland won 4-2 at Swansea last season - but he was starved of service as the Black Cats undid their recent good work with a damaging defeat which leaves them bottom of the table, albeit still only a point adrift of safety.\nMan of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson\nWhat the managers said\nSwansea boss Bob Bradley to BBC Sport: \"The word we used with the players this week was pride, and we wanted to change it to intensity and a clean sheet. I am satisfied with that.\n\"It is a good feeling to get on top. It has not happened enough this season. It helps and gets the supporters behind us. The atmosphere starts to change. The momentum goes through the team and that is what we really need right now.\n\"It shows the supporters are with the team. It has been a tough time but they know how to support the players. They were there for us. It is important that we enjoy the moment but we cannot lose focus. We need to build on this result.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It was frustrating. We didn't play particularly well and we didn't take a couple of opportunities.\n\"We should have created more chances. We had one or two moments, but it was a tough game and circumstances as well.\n\"If you get the first goal, it always gives you confidence. The game turned on a tight decision. The cross was only two or three yards away from [Denayer] when it came in. That said, I don't think he should have had his hands up there. It was a big call.\"\nA first loss against Swansea for Moyes\nSwansea have now won two of their past three Premier League games, after winning none of their first five under Bob Bradley (D2 L3).\nIn his seventh league meeting with Swansea, David Moyes suffered his first loss (W5 D1 L1).\nThe Swans have netted eight goals in their past two home league games, more than they managed in their previous seven.\nSunderland failed to score for the fifth time in their past six away games in the Premier League (just two goals in total).\nAll five of Fernando Llorente's Premier League goals have been at Liberty Stadium.\nGylfi Sigurdsson created six chances in this game; no Swansea player has created more in a Premier League home game."

When he finished, I said 'welcome back'.\"\nFormer Leicester defender Matt Elliott on BBC Radio Leicester: \"There was a spark and zip about Leicester's play from the off. You could sense it, a freshness in the air.\n\"That's their best performance by some distance this season and that might just reignite their season, certainly in domestic terms.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"Leicester won the second balls and scored fantastic goals.\n\"Football is a game with mistakes, especially today. I would never complain to my players and I will look inside myself and analyse the reason why we have problems with the second balls when they arrive.\n\"Our game is not bad, but in the box we have a lot of problems.\"\nMatch of the Day pundit Danny Murphy: \"That's as good as I've seen Leicester this season, it was like the Leicester of last season. But City didn't half help them.\n\"Kolarov was supposed to be playing as a third centre-half but he played so far forward, he left Stones isolated. Zabaleta was playing in a weird in-between position and it didn't look like he knew what he was doing.\n\"Kevin de Bruyne appeared to be at left-wing-back. The communication and lack of line was pretty bad. Kolarov was playing his own game going forward so often. They gave Leicester so many opportunities to attack them. It could have been more.\n\"Fifty changes, they've made this season. It's nice to build relationships and have some familiarity. You can't keep changing players.\"\nDefensive numbers make bad reading for Guardiola\nGuardiola has seen his side concede three or more goals in back-to-back league games for the first time as a manager.\nA Guardiola side conceded four goals in a league for only the third time (Atletico Madrid 4-3 Barcelona in 2009, Wolfsburg 4-1 Bayern Munich in 2015).\nOnly Crystal Palace, Hull and Sunderland (one) have kept fewer clean sheets than Manchester City in the Premier League this season.\nClaudio Ranieri has won eight of his nine Premier League matches as a manager against Manchester City, drawing the other.\nManchester City conceded twice in the opening five minutes of a Premier League game for the first time since October 2006 against Wigan.\nWhat's next?\nOn Monday, both sides find out who they will face in the last 16 of the Champions League.\nManchester City will be drawn against one of Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Monaco or Napoli.\nLeicester City will meet Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid or Sevilla.\nOn Tuesday, Leicester travel to Bournemouth (19:45 GMT). Manchester City host Watford the following day (20:00)."

West Brom is a tough team, a physical team who are difficult to break down. It was a good win and now we must continue.\n\"We have won nine in a row which is fantastic because this league is very tough. We are working very well.\n\"I think West Brom prepared well defensively and tried to close every space. This game, if you find the goal quickly, you can have an easier game. When you don't find the goal, it becomes more difficult but we were very good to find in the right moment to do it.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis told Match of the Day: \"I was happy all the way through the game. They play a different system to most teams and we'd worked on a structure to beat them.\n\"It's disappointing because Gareth [McAuley] has got to deal with it. He's made a mistake and we move on. We don't really want to criticise anyone. Our structure and organisation was very good.\n\"One mistake, one chance and the fella puts it away - that's the difference in quality that separates the teams at the top.\"\nChelsea match winning run - match stats\nChelsea have won at least nine Premier League games in a row for the fifth time, more than any other team in the competition\nFor the first in the Premier League, Tony Pulis has named an unchanged line-up in four successive games\nIt's also the first time West Brom have named an unchanged line-up in four successive Premier League games\nChelsea recorded their highest share of possession in a league game this season (66.9%)\nFouls on Diego Costa have resulted in nine cards being shown in the league this season, more than any other player\nCosta has been involved in 17 goals in the league so far this season (12 goals, five assists); more than any other player\nIn fact, Costa has either scored or assisted in 15 of his last 17 league games - only failing to do so against Manchester United and Arsenal this season\nWhat's next?\nChelsea go to bottom side Sunderland on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) before a London derby at Crystal Palace on Saturday at 12:30.\nWest Brom host Swansea on Wednesday (20:00) and then have another home game against Manchester United on Saturday at 17:30."

But we played very well.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think it was an even game, a really competitive game. A game that was difficult to play, always at Old Trafford.\n\"We created some clear chances to score but I think they were more creative on goal and from that they scored and we didn't.\"\nHow long since United have won a home league game?\nManchester United earned their first Premier League win at Old Trafford since September, having drawn their last four in a row at home.\nTottenham have lost back-to-back away Premier League games for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino, last doing so in March 2014 (a run of three).\nSpurs are winless in their last five away from home in the Premier League, their longest such run since April 2012 (a run of eight).\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan has been involved in four goals in his last four games for Manchester United in all competitions (two goals, two assists).\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides will find out who they will face in the last 32 of the Europa League when the draw is made on Monday.\nAfter that, Manchester United travel to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, while Tottenham host Hull City on the same day (both at 20:00 GMT)."

We changed the system and it was a very good second half and we deserved other goals.\n\"It is an important result after the disappointment of the squad [going out of the Europa League]. The three points are very important and it is always important after a disappointment to win the next game and we showed good character.\"\nOn match-winner Boufal: \"He is a fantastic player - his qualities are fantastic. He can become an important player for the squad.\"\nOn the future of club captain Jose Fonte: \"Now is not the moment [to discuss that]. It is the time to stay concentrated until the end of the year. The importance is the collective of the squad.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"We did almost everything, I can't say anything about the players. We kept working but in the Premier League you have to score your chances.\n\"We finished the first half well and I said we had to keep that intensity but they started the second half better than us. We're improving and growing, especially in defence.\"\nOn the injured Negredo and Ramirez: \"It would be easy to say we missed them but we win and lose as a team and I am happy with the players who played.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are back in Premier League action on Wednesday, with Middlesbrough at home to Liverpool (19:45 GMT) and Southampton away at Stoke City (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-2 West Ham United\nGoals by Dimitri Payet and Michail Antonio exposed Liverpool's defensive frailties again as West Ham climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone with a hard-fought draw at Anfield.\nAfter conceding four in last weekend's loss at Bournemouth, Liverpool shipped two avoidable first-half goals on their way to ceding more ground to Chelsea and Arsenal in the title race.\nAdam Lallana's smart low finish had put Liverpool ahead inside five minutes but the visitors were level before the half-hour when goalkeeper Loris Karius - at fault for Bournemouth's winner a week ago - failed to deal with Payet's saveable 25-yard free-kick.\nKarius was less culpable for West Ham's second scored by Antonio, but it was a scruffy goal that did not reflect well on a Liverpool backline that has now conceded 20 goals in 15 league games - the worst record among the teams in the top six.\nBut errors were not the sole preserve of the Liverpool defence, and a big mistake by West Ham goalkeeper Darren Randolph, dropping a cross into the path of Divock Origi, gifted Liverpool the equaliser.\nRandolph made amends with a quite stunning late save to keep out Jordan Henderson's equally sublime strike as West Ham held on for a point that sees them climb to 17th.\nReaction to all of Sunday's Premier League matches\nKarius under scrutiny again\nUntil recently Liverpool's new goalkeeper had largely gone under the radar since joining from manager Jurgen Klopp's former club Mainz in the summer.\nAfter missing the start of the season with a broken hand, Karius was installed as Klopp's number one at the end of September, replacing Simon Mignolet.\nThe German had a relatively untroubled time of it in his first nine games, although small mistakes were in evidence - but nothing as high-profile as the injury-time spill that allowed Nathan Ake to score Bournemouth's winner last time out.\nAnd the pressure is sure to intensify on the 23-year-old after his part in West Ham's opener, with Payet's free-kick nicely struck but much too central to be considered unstoppable.\nWest Ham's second goal was also avoidable from Liverpool's perspective.\nHavard Nordtveit's hopeful drilled pass from his own half struck the head of the retreating Henderson, deflecting the ball high into the air and wrong-footing Reds centre-back Joel Matip, allowing Antonio in.\nThe West Ham man might not have had the chance to score had Karius been further advanced in his area, but nothing should be taken away from the finish, a cute poke with the outside of his boot that just had enough force to cross the line.\nLiverpool lack killer instinct\nLiverpool are the top scorers in the Premier League with 37 goals in 15 games, so it is perhaps uncharitable to point the finger at their forward line after this blip.\nYet for all their possession - 68% - they managed just three shots on target in the whole match, with two of those coming from West Ham errors.\nThe visitors were guilty of snoozing for Liverpool's opener as Sadio Mane picked up the ball in the middle of the park and made unchecked progress to the left wing.\nHis cross arrived at the feet of Lallana, who had time to control and finish under zero pressure from a static West Ham defence.\nTheir second was also a gift, Mane's cross inexplicably squirming out of Randolph's gloves and landing perfectly for Origi to score for a fourth successive game in all competitions - the first Liverpool player to do so since Daniel Sturridge in February 2014.\nMane was at the heart of everything good Liverpool did in attack, playing a part in an intricate passing move that ended with a blocked Henderson shot, and then twisting and turning on the edge of the area to create an opening for Georginio Wijnaldum that flew wide.\nWijnaldum also failed to get enough curl on his shot when advancing on goal down the left channel, while Roberto Firmino was guilty of missing the target after good approach play.\nIndeed Liverpool's only other shot on target was Henderson's superb long-distance strike, which was reminiscent of his stunning winner against Chelsea in September but met on this occasion by the right hand of the flying Randolph.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nAntonio finds his feet - match stats\nWatford are the only side in the top half of the table to have conceded more goals (26) than Liverpool (20).\nWest Ham have scored five goals in their past two league games at Anfield - as many as they did in their previous 20.\nMichail Antonio scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season, but his first that wasn't a header. His last non-headed goal was at Stoke on the last day of last season.\nThe Hammers have now lost a league-high 12 points from leading positions in the Premier League this season.\n'The goals could have been avoided' - reaction\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"We tried everything. One West Ham goal was a free-kick and one was lucky. They were 2-1 up and we had some great offensive situations and should have had more. We tried everything. We were often in the box, a lot of situations.\n\"It felt like the whole time we were were in their box. We needed a bit of luck. A draw doesn't feel too good, doesn't feel too bad.\n\"The goals could have been avoided. For the first goal - don't make the foul, don't lose the ball. The second goal was unlucky. Joel Matip had a fantastic game and in this moment he couldn't clear the ball. Loris Karius was surprised and it was too late.\n\"Should Karius have saved the free-kick? For this I have to see it again - I only saw it in the match.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We showed a great reaction after they were one up. In the first half we were very good.\n\"I wasn't happy with the second half because I expected us to be better on the ball. In the end, well done for the players.\"\nOn Darren Randolph's mistake: \"It's the nature of their job - when they make a mistake it is obvious. He made a mistake but after and before he showed real quality and he was crucial for us in moments when they had a chance or two.\"\nWhat's next?\nIt's a quick turnaround for these clubs with a round of midweek Premier League fixtures to come. Both teams are in back action at 19:45 GMT on Wednesday as Liverpool travel to Middlesbrough and West Ham host Burnley."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-0 Leicester City\nBournemouth moved to the highest league position in their history as Leicester's miserable run away from home continued with defeat at Vitality Stadium.\nThe champions paid for a lacklustre first half, where they created clear openings for Jamie Vardy and Robert Huth, but surrendered the ball all too easily.\nEddie Howe's side saw 70% of the ball before the break and Marc Pugh scored for the hosts on his first league start of the season with a controlled drive from 18 yards out.\nLeicester improved but ran into a stubborn home defence and goalkeeper Artur Boruc produced a key save to deny Leonardo Ulloa from six yards in the final minute.\nRelive Bournemouth's hard-earned win\nIt means Claudio Ranieri's side set an unwanted record as their haul of one point away from home is the lowest total by a defending top-flight champion from the first eight away games of a season.\nThey remain 14th, four points above the bottom three, while the Cherries move to eighth.\n'The model professional'\nBoruc's late save followed a key block from Steve Cook to thwart substitute Shinji Okazaki. The two interventions epitomised Bournemouth's resilience and Howe described it as a \"heroic\" defensive display.\nHis side had conceded nine goals in three games before kick-off, prompting him to call for more solid showings and that is what he got.\nGood home possession early on killed any momentum Leicester hoped to carry from Saturday's thrilling victory over Manchester City.\nAnd Bournemouth's reward for a fifth home win of 2016-17 is to be five points better off than they were at the same stage last season.\nPugh added to the positives with an excellent all-round display, showing good technique in keeping a bouncing ball on target for the winner after Benik Afobe's shot was saved.\nHowe - who refused to set a target of European qualification after the win - described the match winner as \"the model professional\" for his patience in waiting for his chance start a league fixture.\nClaudio's unhappy landmark\nThe statistics get uglier for Leicester, who have no back-to-back wins in the league since April.\nThe Foxes have conceded 19 goals on the road, one more than in all 18 away games last season and have managed 21 goals in 16 games - 13 fewer than at the same stage last term.\nAnd against Bournemouth they looked one-dimensional going forward. They mustered 12 shots but many of them arrived in a late flurry. Vardy - a hat-trick hero three days earlier - had 26 touches, the same number as Islam Slimani, who was taken off at the break and just six more than Okazaki, who replaced the Algerian.\nHuth's early volley - deflected wide moments before Pugh's winner - could have significantly changed proceedings but with just 37% possession on the night and only 68% of their passes finding a team-mate, Leicester were not good enough.\nTheir display on the south coast was confused. They were slow from the off and limited in their reaction until it was too late.\nRanieri - who has now managed 200 games in the Premier League - will have to find answers.\nMan of the match - Steve Cook (Bournemouth)\nWhat the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It didn't feel anything like routine. It was dramatic playing the champions, we know their qualities and the lads did particularly well. It was a heroic defensive display. I thought we were magnificent in that respect.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"The result is too severe against us because we created more chances than Bournemouth. I wanted a little more in the first half. A little more and we can score goals, recover more second balls. The second half was much better. If we continue to fight at this level, sooner or later we will get a good result.\"\nLeicester's run of conceding - stats\nThe Cherries have won as many home games in their past seven Premier League games (W5) as they did in their first 20 in the competition.\nThe Foxes have not won a Premier League away trip since April (10 games without a win), their longest run since October 2003 (a run of 16 away games without victory).\nLeicester City have conceded in each of their past 10 Premier League away games - their worst run since April 2002 (also 10).\nClaudio Ranieri is the first Italian manager to reach 200 Premier League games (146 for Chelsea, 54 for Leicester City).\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth host their south-coast rivals Southampton at 13:30 GMT on Sunday, while Leicester will look to end their dismal away run by taking points at Stoke City on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-1 Arsenal\nArsenal missed the chance to go top of the Premier League as Everton came from behind to secure a first victory since October.\nThe Gunners, who had won their previous three games, were rewarded for an impressive start as Alexis Sanchez's free-kick deflected in off Ashley Williams.\nEverton equalised just before half-time when Seamus Coleman glanced home Leighton Baines' excellent cross.\nThe Toffees, encouraged by a vocal crowd, dominated thereafter and Williams powered home a late header to complete the turnaround.\nHome captain Phil Jagielka was sent off in the dying minutes for a second bookable offence and Arsenal had two shots cleared off the line in a frantic finale.\nBut they could not prevent a first league defeat since their opening match of the season, leaving them three points behind leaders Chelsea, who have a game in hand.\nEverton, meanwhile, are up to seventh, four points behind fifth-placed Tottenham.\nRelive Everton's dramatic win against Arsenal\nListen - Wenger critical of referee following Everton winner\nAn off day for Arsenal attackers\nArsenal had thumped West Ham 5-1, Basel 4-1 and Stoke 3-1 in their previous three games, but two away games in the space of five days at Everton and Manchester City would provide Arsene Wenger's side with a real chance to prove they are genuine title challengers.\nAfter Sanchez struck, and with the hosts struggling to get out of their own half, it looked as though another big win was on the cards. But the Gunners failed to build on the goal, which came from their only shot on target until the 90th minute, when Nacho Monreal and Alexi Iwobi had efforts cleared off the line.\nIt may just have been an off day for Arsenal's forwards, but they are also struggling at the other end.\nWenger's men have failed to keep a clean sheet in 11 successive games, and the Frenchman must address that if they are to challenge for a first league title since 2004.\nKoeman can breathe a little easier\nThe scrutiny on Everton boss Ronald Koeman had increased during a run of just one win in the 10 Premier League games prior to Arsenal's visit.\nThey had also kept just one clean sheet in that time and, against a free-scoring Arsenal, they were cautious from the outset.\nFor the first quarter of an hour there was a significant gap between forwards Romelu Lukaku and Enner Valencia and their team-mates, as they looked to play on the counter-attack.\nIt was an ineffective tactic as they failed to trouble Petr Cech, but Sanchez's goal forced them to become more adventurous. The midfield pushed up to offer Lukaku and Valencia more support, and they suddenly looked a more dangerous side.\nThey showed plenty of grit and determination in the closing stages as Arsenal mounted one final, desperate attempt to snatch a draw, and the final whistle was greeted with roars of delight from the home fans.\nIt could prove to be a significant result in determining the course of Everton's campaign.\nMan of the match - Idrissa Gueye\nWhat they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I don't think we deserved to lose the game but we were caught on two headers. Especially on the first one we were guilty.\n\"We controlled Romelu Lukaku well but two defenders scored. Maybe we made it easy for them when they became more physical. They played a real cup game tonight.\n\"They defended well even when we controlled the game. We created chances but not too many were clear-cut. We battled hard. We put everything in and the players are very disappointed.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The first 20 minutes, that was really poor. We were very nervous and unsure. Every ball was passed back, there were mistakes and no aggression.\n\"But after that we played face-to-face, we showed unbelievable spirit to come back and we deserved the win. We were lucky in the last situation but we played great football and with the support of the fans it is really difficult to beat us here.\n\"Sometimes it is difficult to understand why we start so poorly at the beginning. Of course there is some lack of confidence but you have to show your personality. We showed big personality.\"\nComeback kings - the stats\nEverton have won the most points from losing positions in the Premier League this season (11).\nThe Gunners have lost on a Tuesday in the Premier League for the first time since February 2006 v Liverpool.\nAshley Williams scored his first Premier League goal for Everton in his 15th appearance.\nWilliams' goal was the first Arsenal have conceded from a corner in the Premier League this season.\nAlexis Sanchez has had a hand in 27 goals in his past 27 Premier League appearances for Arsenal (19 goals, eight assists).\nNo player has scored the opening goal on more occasions in the Premier League this season than Alexis Sanchez (five).\nArsenal have scored as many Premier League goals from outside the box this season (four) as they managed in the whole of 2015-16.\nLeighton Baines provided his 48th Premier League assist; four more than any other defender.\nSeamus Coleman has scored in two of his past three Premier League apps at Goodison Park.\nWhat next?\nThe win could not have come at a better time for Everton as they prepare for Monday's Merseyside derby with Liverpool at Goodison Park (20:00 GMT). However, they will be without Jagielka following his dismissal.\nArsenal, meanwhile, are back in the north west of England as they visit Manchester City on Sunday (16:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-0 Burnley\nMark Noble's first-half strike earned West Ham their first Premier League win in seven games as they beat Burnley at London Stadium.\nIt looked like the Hammers would go into the break without anything to show for their dominance, but in stoppage time they won a spot-kick when Ben Mee brought down Winston Reid.\nUp stepped Noble. His initial kick was saved low by Tom Heaton but he kept his composure to tuck in the rebound.\nNoble and Pedro Obiang both struck the woodwork with brilliant shots and Burnley's Matt Lowton produced a goal-saving block to deny Aaron Cresswell.\nThe Clarets improved markedly after the break. Keeper Darren Randolph made a great one-handed save to keep out Scott Arfield's free-kick and Sam Vokes headed over with the goal gaping.\nVictory lifted the Hammers four points clear of the relegation zone and up to 15th in the table.\nRelive the action from London Stadium\nReaction to Wednesday's other Premier League games\nHammers welcome in-tune Carroll\nThrow the ball into the box and Andy Carroll will get his head to it.\nIt is a simple tactic that has worked in the past and will continue to pay dividends for West Ham if they can keep their 6ft 4in bulldozer fit.\nThe 27-year-old Geordie striker made his first start since August after recovering from a knee injury, and bullied the Clarets defence during the 83 minutes he played.\nHe only managed one header on target, and should have done better with another after just two minutes. However, his big strength is the ability to pull two defenders away, allowing his team-mates more space.\nThe Hammers have missed their target man immensely - can they keep him fit for the rest of the season?\nSluggish start costs Burnley\nHad the Clarets played the first half with the same conviction they showed in the second then there might have been a different outcome.\nManager Sean Dyche's side were a different proposition after the break. Cresswell cleared from the goal-line with Vokes ready to stab in, before the striker inexplicably headed over from six yards with an open goal in front of him.\nAnd 17 minutes before full-time, Randolph pulled off a great save to prevent Arfield's low free-kick from creeping in.\nIt was an improvement, but again not good enough.\nBurnley are five points clear of the relegation zone, but that is now only one point from a possible 20 away from home this season. They need to start picking up on their travels or they will face another scrap for survival.\nMan of the match - Andy Carroll\n'Carroll is a miracle'\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"It was a very important game for us. It was a very long game - the longest game we've been involved in.\n\"Well done to the players, we showed the character. I think we deserved it. We dominated the first half and we had shots that hit the post. We should have been ahead by more than one goal looking at the quantities of chances.\"\nBilic on striker Carroll: \"It's no secret I'm a big fan of him. I'm not a big fan because he's a cousin or relative. It's what I see on the training pitch. He is a miracle. What he gives to the team is massive.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche on the penalty: \"I'm frustrated we can't get the decision. It's a clear foul on our keeper Tom Heaton [in the build up].\n\"Every other keeper in the league would have gone down and flailed around on the ground.\n\"Ours does it the proper way and that used to be applauded. Now we are called naive. But we'll stick to what we believe in.\"\nHe added: \"The reality of the Premier League is that it's tough. We took the game on in the second half.\n\"We have to bring the mentality of our home displays to away games. In the first half we didn't take responsibility of a game that could have gone our way. There was a strange feeling here today and we didn't capitalise on that until the second half.\"\nThe stats - 1-0 to the Hammers... again\nMark Noble scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham since April when he scored twice against West Brom\nNoble has scored in each of his past 10 Premier League seasons. The only top-flight season in which he did not score in was his first (2005-06).\nThe West Ham midfielder missed just his fourth penalty of the 21 he has taken in the Premier League, before converting the rebound [17 out of 21 scored].\nBurnley have failed to score in a Premier League-high eight games this season.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley have another away trip to London - this time at Tottenham on Sunday (16:00 GMT) and West Ham are at home to Hull on Saturday (15:00)"

Often keeping possession with 10 home shirts behind the ball, Liverpool waited for key moments to inject pace into attacks with devastating effect.\nKlopp's decision to replace Karius drew focus before kick-off, but that will switch to his side's qualities after this display.\nLallana was at the centre of everything they did well. Shortly after arriving at the back post to head home the opener, he slid in to block a stinging Adam Forshaw shot at the other end.\nMane struck the woodwork, giving the hosts hope in the second half, but a one-touch interchange involving the Senegal international, Georginio Wijnaldum, Lallana and Origi for the second goal epitomised all that was good about the classy visitors.\nLallana has now been involved in 12 goals this season, scoring six and making six - a healthy improvement on the 10 he was involved in across 30 appearances in 2015-16.\nAnd at the other end Liverpool also answered questions. They have scored 40 goals in the league after 16 matches - the last time they did that they won the title in 1978-79 - but the fact they have still conceded one more goal than Boro is worrying.\nEven without the composure Joel Matip often offers, his replacement Ragnar Klavan formed part of a solid defence alongside Dejan Lovren, with Mignolet only making one key save to deny Viktor Fischer before half-time.\nKaranka's attacking dilemma\nEven against a Reds side who had conceded six goals in their past two matches, Boro could not overcome their growing tendency to be blunt in front of goal.\nA three-goal margin suggests their problems were defensive, but with striker Alvaro Negredo constantly isolated, perhaps more support for him in the final third could have at least offered them a footing.\nTheir 13 goals and their tally of 41 shots on target are both league lows. They managed three on target on Wednesday but have not had four in a match this season.\nAitor Karanka's side are clearly committed - they have made more tackles than any side this season - but they are yet to win two games in a row since being promoted.\nAt this stage last season Newcastle had a point more than Boro but ended up being relegated.\nMiddlesbrough will have far easier nights, but they are edging close to trouble and solving their attacking difficulties could go a long way to aid their fortunes.\nMan of the match - Adam Lallana\nKlopp's Lallana chat - what they said\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"We have to remember how good we've been in the games before this, against Bournemouth and Hull City. I think they were the best team we've faced this season.\n\"We tried, especially in the second half with two new players, to press higher. It proved impossible to stop them. I can admit they were much better than us.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"We had moments in the first half where we were static and even I was confused. We did much better second half, we could have finished more often.\n\"Adam Lallana is improving even when he doesn't score, but it's nice he's in that situation. About a year ago I had sat him in the office and I was happy with him but he was like 'I'm not scoring' - and I said he wasn't in the right positions. Tonight he was twice in the right position and it was wonderful.\"\nLallana England's spark - top stats\nLiverpool picked up their first Premier League win at the Riverside Stadium since March 2002, ending a run of seven trips there without victory\nBoro conceded more goals on Wednesday than they had in their four previous Premier League home games\nIt was Middlesbrough's heaviest home defeat in the Premier League since October 2008 when they were beaten 5-0 by Chelsea\nLallana's first goal was the first time an English player has assisted another English player for Liverpool in the Premier League this season\nLallana has both scored and assisted a goal in three different Premier League games this season - no player has done so more\nUp next?\nMiddlesbrough have another home league fixture against relegation-threatened Swansea City on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off), while Liverpool travel to Everton on Monday (20:00) for what will be Ronald Koeman's first Merseyside derby in charge of the Toffees."

Conte also took the opportunity to rest Nemanja Matic as Fabregas made his first start since 3 December.\nInitially, Chelsea appeared to miss Hazard's creativity as they struggled to find a way to break down a packed Sunderland defence, but Fabregas highlighted the Blues' strength in depth.\nAs Sunderland's seven-man defence frustrated the visitors, Fabregas somehow managed to find the gap to sneak a shot into the far corner and ultimately give Chelsea victory.\nConte calls for improvement\nChelsea have kept a clean sheet in five of their previous seven games but their inability to put the game out of Sunderland's reach was a cause for concern for Conte.\nFor the third time in four games, they won by a single goal margin and Conte is now keen to see his side improve their finishing.\n\"When you have the possibility to kill the game you must kill the game,\" he said. \"We had this possibility but we didn't and at the end Courtois made a good save. I hope in the future we can improve.\"\nPositives for Black Cats\nThree points for Sunderland would have moved them off the bottom of the table but against the league's in-form side it was always going to be a tough ask.\nWhile chances of their own were in short supply, the hosts showed plenty of spirit and determination and Diego Costa, the joint-top scorer in the Premier League, was kept largely quiet by a well-organised and disciplined defence.\nOn the occasions Chelsea did manage to break through the Sunderland back line, Pickford once again highlighted why he is one of the most exciting young English goalkeepers around.\nThere is still a long way to go, but three wins from their six previous games, as well as an encouraging display against the league leaders, suggests they have every chance of clawing their way to safety.\nMan of the match - Jordan Pickford\n'We deserved more than that'\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"Don't say commiserations, it sounds bad, they deserve more than that. We don't have the quality of Chelsea but we did a really good job.\n\"I thought we would get a goal, but Courtois made two great saves, and it would have been a really good point.\"\nTop at Christmas, title winners? The stats\nSix of the past seven teams to top the Premier League at Christmas have gone on to win the title.\nChelsea have become the 10th side to win 10-plus Premier League games in a row, with it being the third occasion the Blues have done it [more than any other side].\nAntonio Conte is only the second manager in Premier League history to win 13 of his opening 16 games in the competition [after John Gregory at Aston Villa in 1998].\nThe Black Cats have lost 10 Premier League games at the Stadium of Light against Chelsea, more than they have against any other side at the ground.\nCesc Fabregas has scored more goals at the Stadium of Light (four) than he has at any other away ground in the Premier League.\nChelsea have gone on to win the league title on each of the four previous occasions they have been top of the league at Christmas (2014-15, 2009-10, 2005-06 & 2004-05).\nWhat next?\nBoth sides do not have long to wait for their next game as Sunderland welcome Watford to the Stadium of Light (15:00 GMT) on Saturday while Chelsea return to London to visit Crystal Palace on the same day (12:30)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 Hull City\nChristian Eriksen scored twice as Tottenham proved far too strong for spirited Hull City at White Hart Lane.\nThe Denmark international struck in either half as Spurs consolidated their grip on fifth place in the Premier League with their eighth win of the season.\nDanny Rose laid Eriksen's first on a plate inside 15 minutes after good work down the left, and Kyle Walker did likewise from the right to snuff out any hope of a Hull comeback after the break.\nEriksen was desperately unlucky not to claim the match ball after seeing a superb free-kick tipped on to the post by Hull goalkeeper David Marshall, allowing Victor Wanyama to mop up the rebound from a couple of yards out.\nHull can have no complaints about the defeat but the one-sided final score was a tad unfair on the Tigers after they matched their hosts for long spells.\nHowever, 35 goals conceded in 16 games is a damning statistic for the side second-bottom of the league - as is the fact they have now lost six away games in succession, equalling their top-flight record.\nReaction from Wednesday's eight Premier League fixtures\nRelive the action from White Hart Lane\nFlying wing-backs crucial to unlocking Tigers\nSpurs dominated possession and chances - having 27 shots in all - but clear-cut openings were at a premium. Wing-backs Rose and Walker were a constant menace, however, and it was through them that Spurs had the most joy.\nWith 14 minutes gone Rose sprinted down the wing to latch on to Jan Vertonghen's long ball, advanced and cut inside his marker before laying off for Eriksen to thump the ball high into the net.\nWith Spurs deploying Eric Dier alongside Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in a three-man defence, Spurs' wing-backs enjoyed greater licence to get forward and their second goal bore similarities to the first.\nThis time it was Dier with a ball over the top for Walker to collect and advance into the area, and when he crossed low across the face of goal it was an easy task for Eriksen to tuck home his second at the back post - his fifth goal in his last four Premier League games.\nRose then won the free-kick from which Spurs netted their third, capping a fine display by the England full-back.\nHull pay for missed opportunities\nDespite the gulf between the sides in terms of league position and resources, Hull produced a display that was, for a time, on a par with their hosts.\nThey carved out 10 shots on goal away from home against a top-five side - something they have struggled to do at home to lesser opposition this season - and with a bit more composure might have pegged Spurs back at 1-1.\nJake Livermore was the pick of Hull's players against his former club and it was he who very nearly pulled them level. His first chance arrived during a sustained spell of Hull pressure after falling behind, but Hugo Lloris got down well to keep out his poked effort.\nThe Tigers' second good chance arrived as the Spurs faithful were just beginning to grumble at their team's inability to impose themselves on the visitors at the start of the second half.\nSpurs had several penalty appeals turned down by referee Andre Marriner, and it was following one of those - after Eriksen was bundled over by Andrew Robertson - that Hull nearly levelled.\nThe breakaway ended with Livermore being played in on the right of the area, but his initial shot was blocked and his follow-up cleared away by the left boot of Lloris.\nThree minutes later Eriksen was slotting in his second goal of the night and the game was up for the Tigers.\nMan of the match - Christian Eriksen\nMatch stats - Eriksen ranks with Hazard and Ozil\nSpurs have scored in each of their past 16 league games at White Hart Lane, the longest current home scoring streak in the Premier League.\nChristian Eriksen has been involved in six goals in his past four Premier League games, scoring five and assisting one.\nSince his Premier League debut in September 2013, Eriksen has been involved in 55 goals in the competition (28 goals, 27 assists), with Eden Hazard the only midfielder with more (60 - while Mesut Ozil also has 55).\nVictor Wanyama netted his first Premier League goal in his past 14 games in the competition (since netting v Crystal Palace in August).\nHull City have now failed to score in 12 of their past 17 Premier League games away in London.\nManager reaction\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think it was a game we dominated. I think the most important is the three points, to be close to the top four.\n\"In some parts the team play well, which is hard against a team playing for survival.\"\nOn Christian Eriksen: \"He was very close to a hat-trick. It was a very good performance for him - he played very very well.\"\nOn Eric Dier: \"I know there are a lot of rumours, but he's 100% our player. He's very important for us. He signed a contract after the Euros and showed his commitment to the club. There's no doubt his future is at White Hart Lane.\"\nHull boss Mike Phelan: \"We came here with a fabulous attitude. They've come here and played the ball, controlled it, restricted their attempts, but at a certain time in the game we were more than value for money.\n\"I thought they did very well but we're on the end of a 3-0 defeat - but we have to stay positive.\n\"Every game is key, it's all on the next game and we can only look forward. I'm staying positive for these players and hopefully we can add to the group in January.\n\"If we can keep creating opportunities and doing the right things, I'm hoping we can turn positive performance into results.\n\"We're looking at improving the group. We definitely need to be adding that extra to give the club and supporters and players a lift.\"\nWhat's next?\nIt's back-to-back home games for Tottenham as they welcome Burnley to White Hart Lane on Sunday at 16:00 GMT. Hull are back in London to play West Ham on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-0 Watford\nManchester City earned their first Premier League home win in almost three months as they battled past Watford at Etihad Stadium.\nThe fourth-placed Blues, looking to avoid a third top-flight defeat in a row, led when an unmarked Pablo Zabaleta calmly side-footed in Kevin de Bruyne's deep cross.\nRaheem Sterling clipped the Watford bar after the break, before Odion Ighalo poked over the away team's best chance.\nAnd the Hornets, who drop to 11th, were punished when David Silva tucked in a late second on his 200th league appearance after a swift City break.\nBut the one negative for Blues manager Pep Guardiola was Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan suffering a serious knee injury that the Spaniard said will keep him out \"for several months\".\nAll the reaction to Wednesday's Premier League games\nRelive City's win against Watford\nInjured Gundogan facing long lay-off\nCity finally find home comfort\nCast your mind back to the end of September. Manchester City had won their first 10 matches under Pep Guardiola, including their opening six Premier League games to move four points clear at the top of the table.\nFast forward to mid-December and the picture is less rosy.\nGuardiola's side have since dropped from the summit, losing ground on their title rivals after winning just four of their previous 15 matches going into Watford's visit.\nQuestions have been raised about the acclaimed Spanish manager's methods, which brought him such great success at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.\nThe Blues had not won a top-flight match in front of their own fans since that 10th successive win - a 4-0 victory against Bournemouth on 17 September.\nAnd while their performance lacked the vigour and verve of those early days under Guardiola, the Blues will surely be more than content with a gritty display that keeps them in fourth position.\n\"It has been a long time without a win playing at home, it has been strange,\" said Zabaleta.\nCity remain seven points behind leaders Chelsea, now a point behind Liverpool and Arsenal - with the Gunners visiting the Etihad on Sunday.\nBravo 'excellent' as Man City finally tighten up\nWhere City's problems have stemmed from in recent weeks is quite clear - their leaky defence.\nThe Blues had kept just one clean sheet in their 17 previous matches and, following Saturday's embarrassing 4-2 defeat at champions Leicester City, Guardiola changed his defence in both personnel and formation.\nEngland centre-back John Stones was the notable casualty, dropping to the bench as his boss switched from three centre-backs to a four-man defence.\nAs a result, they looked more organised and resolute than any other time in the past two months.\n\"It was not the prettiest game tonight but we had determination to win the game. We had the clean sheet we've been talking about and were solid defensively,\" added Zabaleta.\nHowever, they were still almost punished when striker Ighalo escaped Zabaleta - but he guided Norden Amrabat's right-wing cross over the bar.\nThe Blues were also grateful to goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who has received some criticism from City fans, for a smart stop from Hornets midfielder Etienne Capoue.\n\"It is not easy to come to a new club and a new country,\" said Guardiola about the Chile international, who arrived from Barcelona in the summer.\n\"I know what people say about him, but he has good experience. When moments arrive he has to be brave. Today he was excellent.\"\nNew-look Hornets attack fails to shine\nWatford have shown two sides to their character under Italian manager Walter Mazzarri - one which is good enough to beat Manchester United and Everton to climb as high as seventh, plus the one which capitulated in a 6-1 thrashing by Liverpool earlier in the season and lost three in four before beating the Toffees at the weekend.\nThis Hornets performance was somewhere in the middle. They showed resilience in not allowing City to carve them open, but chances at the other end were limited.\nDespite sticking three past Everton at the weekend, Mazzarri's side have not found goals easy to come by all season.\nSkipper Troy Deeney has not scored since 1 October after failing to net in his past eight appearances, eventually paying the price as he was dropped to the bench at the Etihad.\nInstead Mazzarri put together a new-look strike partnership of last season's top scorer Ighalo and 20-year-old former Liverpool forward Jerome Sinclair.\nSinclair, making his full debut following a \u00a34m summer move, was a peripheral figure, while Ighalo worked hard but blew his first real sight of goal in the final stages.\nThe defeat, coupled with points for West Brom and Southampton, meant Watford drop down to 11th.\nWe deserved a point - Mazzarri\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri:\n\"We were unlucky because of the chance for Ighalo. If he had scored we would have drawn the game and in my opinion that would have been the fair result.\n\"Ighalo played a great game and he deserved to score. But my whole team played well and they deserved something more. I'm very happy with them.\nOn midfielder Roberto Pererya going off injured: \"He has a knee problem. We need to understand what it is. We will know in the next days. We have not been lucky with injuries. I am not happy with this one.\n\"I don't know how bad it is. I also asked during the game if he felt a twist. He said it was a knock. I am not sure.\"\nOn leaving Deeney out: \"We wanted to get Deeney ready for Sunderland. We have three games in a week and he is on four yellow cards.\"\nWatford don't like Wednesdays - the stats\nCity have won five and drawn two of their past seven league games against Watford\nSilva scored his first Premier League goal since January 2016, ending a run of 23 games without a goal\nSince De Bruyne's Premier League debut in September 2015, only Mesut Ozil (20) has assisted more goals than his 17\nSterling has already eclipsed his Premier League assist tally for last season (two), having assisted three goals this season\nSeven of Pablo Zabaleta's nine Premier League goals have been scored at Etihad Stadium\nWatford have never won a Premier League match on a Wednesday, losing eight out of 10\nYaya Toure and Silva both played their 200th Premier League games for Manchester City\nDeeney has featured in all of Watford's past 57 matches in all competitions - that run began with last season's away Premier League match at Manchester City in August\nAnalysis\nFormer England defender Phil Neville on Match of the Day:\nIt was not about the performance tonight, it was about getting the result. They did not play at their fluent best but they did score a couple of really good goals.\nIt wasn't convincing, it was a bit of a nervous atmosphere at the Etihad today but it was an important three points.\nIt's pathetic that Pep Guardiola has been getting criticism so soon into a season. We wanted Pep to come to England and now we are trying to destroy him, I don't get it.\nWhat's next?\nAnother Premier League home game for Manchester City - against title rivals Arsenal. The Gunners visit the Etihad on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\nThe Hornets are back on the road at the weekend, travelling north again when they go to bottom side Sunderland on Saturday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 1-2 Manchester United\nZlatan Ibrahimovic struck two minutes from time to give Manchester United a vital victory just as it appeared they had squandered another advantage at Crystal Palace.\nThe 35-year-old Swede slid on to Paul Pogba's pass to beat Wayne Hennessey from an acute angle after James McArthur's 66th-minute strike seemed to have rescued a point for a strangely passive Palace.\nPogba's assist repaid Ibrahimovic for creating his opener in first-half stoppage time - although Palace were furious as claims for a handball in the final pass and offside against the scorer were ignored by referee Craig Pawson.\nPawson had a difficult night and United were angered equally when he ignored a clear handball in his own area from Palace substitute Joe Ledley after the break before Juan Mata's shot was contentiously ruled out for offside.\nIn the end, the frustration was Palace's as Ibrahimovic popped up to secure a United win, their second in succession after beating Tottenham at the weekend, and one that had manager Jose Mourinho on the pitch celebrating with his players at the final whistle.\nRelive the drama from Selhurst Park as it happened\nBig two deliver for Mourinho\nIbrahimovic and Pogba were Mourinho's showpiece signings when he took over in the summer - and they are starting to deliver as they appear to be on the same wavelength.\nYes, there was plenty of dispute about both the creation and the finish for Pogba's first but the pair linked instinctively.\nAnd they did it again in that decisive moment when the game was won, Ibrahimovic making the perfect run to profit from Pogba's power and pass.\nIt is happening more and more, as it did when Pogba created a goal for Ibrahimovic against West Ham recently.\nTwo high-class players are in tune with each other. This can only be good news for Mourinho.\nWhen will Rojo learn?\nManchester United defender Marcos Rojo was heavily criticised for a wild two-footed lunge on Everton's Idrissa Gueye in the 1-1 draw at Goodison Park at the start of the month.\nHe was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card from Michael Oliver then - and he was the beneficiary of similar leniency from referee Pawson here at Crystal Palace.\nIn a carbon copy of his transgression at Everton, Rojo launched himself at Palace's Wilfried Zaha and was penalised with a foul and a caution. He farcically protested his innocence but can count himself lucky he was not punished more heavily.\nWatford striker Troy Deeney, speaking on Match Of The Day 2 after the Everton game, said: \"He strikes me as someone who's a bit scared of getting hurt so he's thought 'I'm going to do everything I can to protect myself'.\"\nRojo's tackling was reckless and could have cost the visitors dearly - not to mention the players he is tackling.\nRooney forced to wait\nWayne Rooney needs one goal to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's club record of 249 goals for Manchester United but, with the Old Trafford legend looking on, he was frustrated here.\nIt was not for the want of trying as he worked tirelessly and brought two fine saves from Palace keeper Hennessey, but the wait goes on as he was substituted late on. The show now moves on to West Bromwich Albion at the weekend.\nTough spell for Palace\nIt is now one win in 10 Premier League games for Palace, who are three points above the relegation zone, and it is not about to get any easier for Pardew's side.\nPremier League leaders Chelsea visit Selhurst Park on Saturday and Palace, who have won just six league games in 2016, have to visit Arsenal in their first game of 2017 on 1 January.\nThey failed to register a shot on target in the first half and only came alive after Ledley's introduction at the start of the second.\n\"We knew we had this tricky spell of matches coming up,\" said Pardew after the game. \"We've got a big game Saturday so we've got to take what we can out of this game in terms of our confidence levels.\n\"We could've done better on the break but I can't fault them, they've given me everything and we need a little break here and there and we'll be OK.\"\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba\nMcArthur in rich scoring form\nJames McArthur has scored five Premier League goals this season for Crystal Palace, more than in his previous two seasons at the club combined (four).\nZlatan Ibrahimovic has scored five times in his past five Premier League games, after failing to score in his previous six in the competition.\nPaul Pogba scored and assisted for the first time in a game for Manchester United.\nManchester United are unbeaten in all of their 15 Premier League games against Crystal Palace (W12 D3).\nMourinho's United side are now unbeaten in nine games in all competitions (W6 D3).\nPalace have kept just one clean sheet in their past 21 Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in Premier League action on Saturday. Palace host a London derby with Chelsea at 12:30 GMT, and five hours later United kick off away at West Bromwich Albion."

I thought in the first 20 minutes of the second half - that's where the game was won and we played like we can play.\n\"We say a few things [at half-time] and sometimes you have to say a few things. It was more to do with the fact we had to step up. The main players in the team stepped it up, and that was the important for us. They were three fantastic headers. We're pleased for him and the group. We really had to dig deep and oil the engine.\"\nSwansea boss Bob Bradley: \"Defence is an area where we have to improve. If we could have kept in the game at 1-0, started to play some passes... but all too many times this season we give up the second goal all too quickly and that happened again.\n\"Even when you play well, you don't always take the lead. On both the second and third goals, we didn't move out very quickly, and they were allowed deep into the box.\n\"I thought the first half was solid. Now the key is being able to play for 90 minutes and handle different situations in the game.\"\nRondon steals the show\nRondon has scored 16 goals in the Premier League since the start of last season - 11 more than any other Baggies player. (James Morrison is on five).\nThe striker's hat-trick was also the quickest by a Baggies player in the Premier League (13 minutes), overtaking the record set by Rob Earnshaw in March 2005 against Charlton (16 minutes).\nChris Brunt - who assisted twice in this game - has 42 Premier League assists for West Brom, 19 more than any other player for the club.\nThe Baggies have scored 10 goals in their last three home Premier League games - more than they managed in their previous 10 games at the Hawthorns in the competition (8).\nWayne Routledge has scored four Premier League goals against West Brom - double the amount he's scored against any other team.\nWhat next?\nWest Brom host Manchester United on Saturday, 17 December, in what manager Pulis describes as an \"unbelievably hard game\", while Swansea take on Middlesbrough on Saturday in their second of three games in eight days."

That puts him level with Alan Pardew but below Harry Redknapp (37%) and David Moyes (41%).\nMan of the match - (Sofiane Boufal)\nWhat they said\nStoke manager Mark Hughes on Arnautovic's red card: \"It's unfortunate because he obviously caught him high on the thigh but the ball was bouncing around and it wasn't a violent movement to take the player out.\n\"The ref wasn't great on the night, he missed a number of decisions and clearly missed an elbow from Shane Long on Bruno Martins Indi - that needs looking at again.\n\"Overall the ref put us in a situation and we had to show real work ethic and understanding of what was required. Given the circumstances, the point we gained was magnificent.\"\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"We're disappointed. Eleven against 10 you have to do better. In the first half we were too nervous, in the second half we were better and created a few possibilities, but it was not enough.\n\"There were good crosses and good combinations, but our play was too slow and not effective in the final third. It was two points lost and it's a shame.\"\nOn Arnautovic's red card: \"I think it's a important foul, it was very dangerous, he does not play the ball.\"\nThe stats\nThe Potters mustered just five shots in this game, their lowest haul in a Premier League game since 23 January (three v Leicester City)\nSouthampton have won just one of their past eight away games in the Premier League (D3 L4)\nSouthampton had 71.3% possession, their highest in a Premier League game since December 2013 (78.8% v Aston Villa)\nWhat's next?\nStoke next play on Saturday at home to Leicester in a 15:00 GMT kick-off.

Once we conceded, it was very difficult.\n\"We could not get Wilfried Zaha isolated. We kept the ball and passed it well, but the final pass was very difficult. For our offensive players, it was the toughest game they have had. This team is not getting what it is deserves. That will change.\n\"We have all come up against this system before but it is with outstanding players. They ask questions and do not make errors. N'Golo Kante gives so much energy like he had at Leicester and fills holes which goes unnoticed.\n\"You don't really expect a centre-half [Azpilicueta] to have that quality - it was a Cesc Fabregas-type ball for the goal and it was a crucial one before half time. I take heart from the last two performances. We deserved something.\"\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"The run is fantastic. Congratulations to my players, not me. I am pleased for them because they deserve this. I see every single moment, every day. It is commitment, the way we prepare for the game and the way they fight. I am pleased for the fans who are fantastic home and away and who push us.\n\"We can improve though. You can always improve in different aspects. I am pleased with this level we have reached, but it is important to understand we are only at the 17th game in the season. We must not look at the table. We must not look at our rivals and continue working hard ourselves.\n\"We have reached a good balance between offence and defence. In some moments, our goalkeeper has been decisive. We dominated the last game but Thibaut made a fantastic save. After last season when he conceded lots of goals, this season is very good for him. We attack and defend as a team.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are in Premier League action again on Boxing Day, with Crystal Palace at Watford in the early game (12:30 GMT) and Chelsea hosting Bournemouth (15:00 GMT).\nChelsea will be without 13-goal top goalscorer Costa as a first-half foul on Joe Ledley saw the Spain striker get booked, his fifth yellow card of the season, and he will now serve a one-match suspension. Team-mate Kante will also be missing as he was also shown a fifth yellow card, following a number of fouls."

        "article_text": "West Ham 1-0 Hull City\nMark Noble's controversial penalty was enough to give West Ham an unconvincing victory over luckless Hull City at London Stadium.\nMike Phelan's visitors hit the frame of the goal three times before the hosts went ahead after Tom Huddlestone was adjudged to have brought down Michail Antonio in the area with 14 minutes left.\nThe Hull midfielder had his hands on Antonio but the contact appeared minimal. Referee Lee Mason thought otherwise and Noble stepped up to fire West Ham to back-to-back home Premier League wins for the first time at their new home.\nDieumerci Mbokani had earlier hit the woodwork for Hull when one-on-one with Darren Randolph, before Noble struck his own post as he attempted to clear Andrew Robertson's cross.\nRobertson made it a hat-trick of efforts off the post with a thunderous drive that beat Randolph but not the frame of the goal.\nA seventh straight away defeat allied to Sunderland's victory over Watford means Hull will spend Christmas bottom of the table, while West Ham - after taking seven points in a week - move five points clear of trouble.\nRelive West Ham's narrow win\nReaction to Saturday's games\nHull pay huge price for missed chances\nDefeats do not come much harsher than this - and finishing the day bottom of the table after such a display is going to be a huge psychological blow for Hull's players to overcome.\nHull, seeking a league win away to the Hammers for the first time since 1990, took the game to the hosts from the outset and created countless chances to score.\nDefender Harry Maguire saw Randolph save his header from a corner and then had a header cleared off the line in the second half by Edimilson Fernandes.\nMbokani, back after a three-match ban, really should have scored when he latched on to Aaron Cresswell's under-hit back-pass in the first half, but instead contrived to hit the inside of the upright as he tried to curl the ball beyond Randolph.\nRobertson was impressive down the left and he sent over a teasing cross early in the second half that Noble nodded at pace on to his own post with Randolph beaten. Moments later the Hull left-back let fly from 20 yards with a searing shot, but again it was against the woodwork and not in the net.\nHammers dig in for another gritty win\nAll three of West Ham's league wins at London Stadium before Hull's visit had been by a 1-0 scoreline - so the final score on Saturday probably earned some punters a few quid.\nWhile the table makes good reading right now, the fact remains that this was a largely disjointed performance by the hosts - one that had many fans expressing their discontent at the half-time whistle.\nManager Slaven Bilic was far from happy after an opening 45 minutes in which Hull dominated, and responded at the interval bringing on Andre Ayew and Fernandes for Manuel Lanzini and Pedro Obiang.\nWest Ham improved as the game wore on and very nearly went ahead when Ayew's header was cleared off the line by Robertson, but their threat remained largely limited - with Andy Carroll shackled by the Hull back three of Maguire, Michael Dawson and Curtis Davies.\nBut no-one can accuse West Ham of not taking their chances when they were presented this past week, first in the draw with Liverpool last Sunday and again in narrow wins over Burnley and now Hull.\nMan of the match - Harry Maguire\nReaction: 'We were sloppy, they were better'\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"In the first half definitely we were fortunate. We were sloppy, they were better.\n\"At half-time I said there are a couple of good things, one that it is still 0-0 and second that it can't be much worse, we can lift up the tempo.\n\"In the second half we were much better, in the last half an hour we were really good. We scored the goal and should have finished the game.\n\"It is a massive three points for us. Back-to-back wins, in this stadium, are very good considering the situation we were in.\n\"Am I pleased with our performance? No I'm not. Am I pleased with our reaction? I am, but we have to play for 90 minutes.\"\nHull boss Mike Phelan: \"It's difficult when your team are doing ever so well, you feel for them because you want them to score the goals and get the credit. If we can play like that, we just need a stroke of genius or luck to get us goals.\n\"The post is there to stand in the way of a goal and it did that a few times today.\n\"You have to have a wry smile on your face or you'd be very, very depressed.\"\nOn the penalty decision that went against his team.\"I am not going to go down that road finding fault with the referee's decision. I think West Ham have got away with one.\"\nHull defender Andrew Robertson: \"Anyone who watches the highlights will see we dominated the game. We had so many chances and have been done by a soft penalty.\n\"That is probably our best performance of the season and it ends up with us bottom of the league. That is the beauty of football. We have got to hope it turns around for us.\n\"First half we went in and West Ham were booed off. I can't believe we've not scored today.\n\"Their manager said we were the better team.\"\nStats you need to know: Hull misery at West Ham continues\nWest Ham have won seven consecutive league games at home against Hull City\nMark Noble has scored 15 of his past 17 penalties taken in the Premier League\nNoble has scored in consecutive PL home games for the first time ever\nHull have conceded the first goal of the game on 14 occasions this season in the Premier League; more often than any other team\nWest Ham's past seven Premier League goals against Hull have all come in the second half of games\nThe Tigers are on a run of seven successive away defeats in the Premier League and they have failed to score in the past five of these\nDimitri Payet created six goalscoring chances versus Hull; three times as many as any other West Ham player\nWhat's next?\nThe Boxing Day fixtures are next up for these two.

        "article_text": "Middlesbrough 3-0 Swansea City\nAlvaro Negredo scored twice as Middlesbrough eased to a comfortable home win that sent struggling Swansea deeper into the relegation zone.\nNegredo's excellent first-time finish from Adam Clayton's cross came against the run of play after a bright Swansea opening.\nBut by the time Jordi Amat tripped Adam Forshaw in the box and Negredo coolly slotted in Boro's first penalty of the season, the home side were well on top.\nGaston Ramirez's excellent pass was cushioned home by Marten de Roon as Boro wrapped up their fourth win since promotion from last year's Championship with over 30 minutes to play.\nAitor Karanka's side move up to 14th in the Premier League table, four points from the bottom three.\nSwansea slip one place to 19th after Sunderland's 1-0 win over Watford and are three points from safety.\nRelive Middlesbrough v Swansea\nReaction to Saturday's games\nNegredo boosts Boro's confidence\nBoro began the game as the league's lowest scorers with just 13 goals from 16 games, but this performance strong on attacking flair was far removed from what many might have anticipated.\nThe finish Negredo applied for Boro's first displayed the kind of composure you might expect of a striker scoring far more regularly; his technique was perfect as he re-adjusted to Clayton's difficult low cross for a fourth goal of the season.\nIt seemed to inject a greater belief in the other Boro players too, with Forshaw driving past Swansea centre-back Amat for the penalty just over 10 minutes later after a spell of good pressure.\nNegredo's feigned strike from the spot sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way, and compounded the sense that Swansea would struggle to find a way back, despite their positive start.\nBut perhaps the most elaborate flourish of Boro's new-found attacking verve came later, when Ramirez's beautiful curled pass was pointed home by De Roon at the end of a flowing passing move.\nSwansea's relegation form\nSwansea have now conceded 18 goals in the six away league games since Bob Bradley was appointed as manager in October. They have the top flight's worst defensive record, with 37 conceded, and only goal difference keeps them above bottom-placed Hull.\nThe Swans did show glimpses of potential with some good attacking play but they were let down by the quality of their final ball and hamstrung by poor decisions at the back.\nAmat's challenge on Forshaw was rash and clumsy, even accounting for the Boro midfielder's dynamic charge, while in the game's closing stages, Fabianski and Alfie Mawson almost conspired to let Forshaw slot in an easy fourth.\nThat might not have flattered the home side, such was the superiority of their finishing. Of the 10 shots Boro had, four were on target, and all but one of those were scored.\nBy contrast, Swansea managed 14 attempts on goal but only one shot on target in each half, despite enjoying the majority of possession.\nMan of the match - Alvaro Negredo (Middlesbrough)\nWhat the managers said\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"It was massive to get the win. These wins against direct opponents are always really important.\n\"Everybody in this group is really confident. We've picked up experience after every game.\n\"The main thing is to create chances. We created a few and scored three goals.\"\nSwansea boss Bob Bradley: \"It's the same story. A number of games we've started in a positive way then give away a goal.\n\"We go down 1-0, the goal goes in in a strange way, and we then give away the penalty. We put ourselves in the hole. It's been a case of road matches, but now we have two games at home.\n\"We're disappointed right now. We came in with a good idea. We turn our attention to the home matches over the Christmas period.\"\nNegredo's run - the stats\nMiddlesbrough scored three goals in a Premier League game for the first time since April 2009\nThe Swans have registered just two wins in their last 16 top-flight games, drawing three and losing 11\nAlvaro Negredo has been involved in five of Middlesbrough's last eight Premier League goals (4 goals, 1 assist)\nNegredo has netted four goals in his last four Premier League games, as many as he managed in the 31 before that\nBob Bradley has won just 20% of his Premier League games this season (two out of 10), the worst win rate of any Swansea boss in the competition\nWhat's next?\nMiddlesbrough play away to Burnley on Boxing Day (26 December), when Swansea are at home to West Ham."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 2-2 Leicester City\nChampions Leicester City recovered from Jamie Vardy's red card and a two-goal deficit to claim an incredible draw at Stoke City.\nVardy was contentiously dismissed by referee Craig Pawson for a two-footed tackle on Mame Diouf.\nStoke took advantage to score twice before half-time, with Bojan Krkic converting a penalty after Danny Simpson's handball, and Joe Allen tapping in.\nBut the Foxes mounted a remarkable comeback in the final 15 minutes, with substitute Leonardo Ulloa and Daniel Amartey heading home to snatch a point.\nIt leaves Leicester three points above the relegation zone in 15th, while Stoke are 11th.\nBest and worst of the champions\nA draw never looked likely from the moment Vardy was sent off in the 28th minute.\nThe England striker went in two-footed and off the ground on Diouf, but won the ball.\nPawson deemed it reckless, though, and showed Vardy his second red card of 2016.\nListen: Man Utd decision may have been in referee's mind for Vardy red - Nevin\nLeicester fell apart immediately, as Simpson gave away the penalty by putting his hand in the air while sliding to block a cross, and Allen tapped in after Giannelli Imbula's shot came back off the post and hit the hapless Kasper Schmeichel on the back of the head.\nThe Foxes' discipline vanished - boss Claudio Ranieri had to be held back by his goalkeeper from remonstrating with Pawson at the break, and six of his players were booked in a 10-minute spell either side of half-time.\nBut the finale was incredible, with substitutes Demarai Gray and Ulloa combining with their first touches of the match to make it 2-1 - Gray crossing for Ulloa to head home a goal given by goalline technology despite Ryan Shawcross' effort to clear.\nStoke were pinned into their own half in the closing moments, and Christian Fuchs crossed from the right for Amartey to head in the equaliser.\nA week to forget for Pawson?\nGoing by the rulebook, Pawson was within his rights to send off Vardy, as the tackle looked out of control, particularly in real time.\nBut his inconsistency will frustrate many, with Pawson only showing Manchester United's Marcos Rojo a yellow card for a similar challenge against Crystal Palace in midweek.\nIndeed, perhaps the criticism for that decision was in his mind when he produced the red card for Vardy.\nIt means the spotlight will shine brighter on the rest of his decisions and, though Foxes fans made their thoughts on his performance clear, the penalty award was spot on and he had little choice with most of the eight bookings.\nRanieri and Stoke counterpart Mark Hughes had contrasting opinions on the red card.\nRanieri said: \"One manager says yes, one says no. If you listen to me I say 'no', if you listen to Mark Hughes he says 'yes'.\"\nHughes said: \"It was a two-footed challenge. The lad left the floor and I don't know what Leicester are complaining about. From my point of view it was clear.\"\n'Rubbish' - Was it a red card?\nEx-Chelsea winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live: \"When he goes with his two feet - they were off the ground - he didn't seem to hurt Diouf but that didn't matter in the referee's eyes. I wouldn't have quibbled had they shown Vardy a yellow.\"\nFormer Leicester striker Dion Dublin on Final Score: \"Rubbish. The referee has got that completely wrong. Vardy makes the tackle. He has no intention of making the tackle with two feet at all. It is 100% wrong.\"\nEx-Tottenham striker Garth Crooks on Final Score: \"Craig Pawson has fundamentally misunderstood what has gone on. Vardy left the ground with two feet but he has done that in order to get to the ball.\n\"He won the ball and Diouf gets out of the way. Vardy makes no contact. He has been anything but reckless. Referees are making big decisions with the little teams because it seems to be easier.\"\nSloppy Stoke let it slip\nAmid Leicester's heroics, there will be concern from Stoke boss Mark Hughes at how easily his team let three points escape from their grip.\nWith a one-man advantage and a two-goal lead, the Potters looked to be coasting toward a third win in five games.\nThey forced three good saves from Schmeichel, who put in an impressive performance on his return to the Leicester side after a broken hand.\nBut the hosts dropped deeper and deeper in the second half and, after some slick passing play in the first period, resorted to hitting hopeful balls into the channels.\nIt meant Leicester could keep coming back at them and ultimately Stoke, who had kept three clean sheets in their past four games, looked tired and flimsy at the back.\nMan of the match - Bojan Krkic\n'It could be a turning point' - manager reaction\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes said: \"Leading 2-0 it was well deserved, we were good value for that lead and were in good shape. You have to get the job done and we didn't do that.\n\"You think it should be a straightforward second half, but we made it difficult and allowed them to get back into the game.\n\"We are in decent shape, but this game should have been won.\"\nLeicester City manager Claudio Ranieri said: \"It was a fantastic spirit and we wanted to fight until the end so it was important for us to play well.\n\"During half-time we spoke a lot and had to believe something good was possible. I am always positive.\n\"It could be a turning point today, but we have to wait and see the next matches.\n\"I was angry at the referee because I saw my players fight and there were so many yellow cards, but it was a normal battle in the Premier League.\"\nCan we play here every week? - match facts\nStoke are yet to win a Premier League home game against Leicester (W0 D2 L1) - the only side they have faced more than once at home in the competition but not won against.\nThis was the 14th time Leicester had a player sent off in a Premier League game but avoided defeat, and the first time since they faced Manchester United in May.\nJoe Allen has scored more Premier League goals in 2016-17 (five) than in his previous four seasons combined (four).\nThe Foxes have already conceded more away goals this season (21) than in all of 2015-16 (18).\nJamie Vardy is one of two players to be sent off twice in the Premier League in 2016 (also Victor Wanyama).\nWhat's next?\nThere's a nine-day rest for Leicester as they host Everton on Boxing Day (26 December), while Stoke are in action a day later when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday, 27 December."

We didn't press enough in the first half.\n\"Watford had a lot of set-pieces and we tightened it up with 10 minutes to go by bringing John O'Shea on. You never know if decisions like that are going to work. It did today.\n\"I told the players we had to win. It wasn't a great performance but it was a winning performance, which always hides a multitude of sins.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"We did everything ourselves and I'm very angry. We missed many chances in the first half and we gave them the goal easily.\n\"Sometimes you make mistakes but it's only our fault. We should have scored and we didn't. I've spoken with the guys, they know what they did, and we will have to sort it out.\n\"I'm concerned by the way we play. I was happy with the performance but if we don't take our chances, we won't get anywhere.\"\nMoyes does another Italian job\nDavid Moyes has won his past six Premier League home meetings against Italian managers - three against Roberto Mancini, one against Carlo Ancelotti, one against Claudio Ranieri and one against Walter Mazzarri.\nSix of Patrick van Aanholt's seven top-flight goals for the Black Cats have come at home.\nWatford have now gone six Premier League games without a clean sheet after keeping three in a row, which were their only shut-outs in their past 22 top-flight games.\nWatford have failed to score in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since last March (three in a row then).\nWatford have lost five of their six league trips to the Stadium of Light (W1 D0 L5).\nWhat next?\nWatford will get the Premier League action under way on Boxing Day when they host Crystal Palace on Monday, 26 December at 12:30 GMT. Sunderland manager David Moyes takes his side to former club Manchester United for a 15:00 GMT kick-off on the same day."

The pair were booked for dissent after the Baggies striker appeared to push his opponent in the chest, before slapping him across the face.\nIbrahimovic may have been lucky to escape with only a yellow card - his sixth of the season - when he barged Dawson off the ball with some force - much to the disdain of the home fans.\nAnd in the latter stages of the game Chris Brunt took out an on-rushing Marcus Rashford and was also booked.\nWhen asked about Ibrahimovic's punishment after the match, Pulis replied: \"Ask the 28,000 fans what they thought of it.\"\nMan of the match - Paul Pogba\nMatch stats - Rooney happy to assist\nManchester United are now unbeaten in eight Premier League games (W4 D4), their longest run without defeat in the competition since 1 January 2015 (10 games).\nOnly Ruud van Nistelrooy netted more goals in his first 16 Premier League appearances (12) than Ibrahimovic [11, level with Robin van Persie and Cole].\nWest Brom have kept just one clean sheet in their past 14 top-flight games\nWayne Rooney has registered nine assists this season in all competitions for the Red Devils, more than any other player\nWhat the managers said\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"We gave them a poor goal at the start, which was disappointing. It knocked us a little bit flat.\n\"At half-time I said 'let's make sure we stay in the game, we'll grow into it' and I thought we would. The last thing we wanted was that second goal. It was very fortuitous.\n\"We've played against a team who have found some form and you can see why.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho on Ibrahimovich: \"He is the kind of player who doesn't need to prove anything to anyone but when he decided to come to England for the last period of his career - to the most difficult championship in the world - I think he proved he is a superman in his mentality.\n\"What he is doing at 35 is a dream for every striker of 25 in the Premier League. I need to give him a rest. Now we have a little rest for the first time. It is not just him but everybody.\"\nWhat's next?\nManchester United welcome former manager David Moyes back to Old Trafford when Sunderland visit on Boxing Day, while West Brom travel to Arsenal."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-3 Southampton\nJay Rodriguez's first Premier League goals since August gave Southampton victory over local rivals Bournemouth.\nBoth sides scored with their first efforts on target, with Nathan Ake's acrobatic header putting the Cherries in front after six minutes before Ryan Bertrand levelled with a solo dribble and finish.\nHalf-time substitute Steve Davis made an immediate impact, providing Rodriguez with a tap-in to give the Saints the lead.\nAnd Rodriguez's superb 20-yard finish late on eased the visitors to victory.\nSouthampton move up to seventh, three points above Bournemouth, who stay 10th.\nRodriguez solves Saints' scoring quandary\nA lack of goals had been a growing concern for Southampton, with just three in their previous seven league games and a frustrating 0-0 draw against 10-man Stoke in midweek emphasising their profligacy.\nSaints boss Claude Puel is without injured top scorer Charlie Austin, and in his search for an answer to the problem made six changes, including bringing in Rodriguez for only his third league start of the season.\nThe former Burnley striker rewarded his manager with his first top-flight brace since March 2014, with his second strike a wonderful turn and hit of a bouncing ball from just outside the area.\nBut it was the introduction of Davis at the start of the second period that swung the match, with the Northern Irishman bringing a calming presence in possession after an erratic first half from the visitors.\nDavis made Saints' second goal when he received the ball from Sofiane Boufal's clever back-flick and then rolled across for Rodriguez to finish.\nBoufal, who was a creative and menacing presence for Saints, looked puzzled when he was replaced by Dusan Tadic after an hour, and the Moroccan seemed to receive some strong words from Puel as he took his place on the bench.\nSouthampton fans might also be concerned to see influential defender Jose Fonte on the bench, with the Portuguese reportedly upset\n, external\nwith the progress of contract talks at St Mary's.\nCherries picked off too easily\nBournemouth's continued progress under Eddie Howe cannot be underestimated, but the Cherries' inability to string positive results together is preventing them from breaking into the Premier League's top 10.\nNone of their six league wins this term have been followed up by another victory and once again, after beating Leicester in midweek, they fell short of securing back-to-back successes.\nHowe's side started well and Ake's impressive diving header from Jack Wilshere's deep cross gave them the perfect start, with Joshua King almost squeezing in a second past Fraser Forster.\nBut the hosts faded and would have been disappointed at how easily Bertrand skipped through the middle of Adam Smith and Simon Francis on his way into the area before firing in a brilliant equaliser from a tight angle.\nThe hosts handed the initiative to Southampton after the break and failed to create a meaningful chance as they suffered a fifth defeat in their last six meetings with their south coast rivals.\nMan of the match - Jay Rodriguez\n'Football is great' - Manager and player reaction\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I felt we weren't at our best levels - physically and technically we haven't played as well as we have done in recent weeks.\n\"Credit to Southampton, they played well and deserved to win.\n\"Once they equalised we seemed to lose our way and in the second half it was unlike us because we struggled with the ball.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"It was difficult in the first half, but in the second half we started well with a good spirit and energy and [it was a] very good second half for us.\n\"I am happy for the players and for Jay Rod.\n\"It was difficult for Jay with his long injury and [he] came back step by step. He has played three or four games since the injury of Charlie Austin.\n\"He works well for the team each time and [it is] a pleasure to see him happy with two goals.\"\nSouthampton striker Jay Rodriguez on his two goals: \"The second goal I enjoyed more but any goal scored means a lot. Just playing is the best feeling. Football is great.\n\"On a personal level, you want to be out there winning with your team. I want more of it, and to keep scoring.\"\nWilshere ends his drought - match stats\nJack Wilshere provided his first Premier League assist since September 2014\nIn his 32nd Premier League appearance, Jordy Clasie registered his first Southampton assist\nBoth sides scored with their first shots of any kind in the match, the second time this has happened in the Premier League this season (Crystal Palace and Liverpool both scored with their first shots during their match in October)\nSouthampton scored as many goals in this game as in their last seven Premier League games combined\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth will travel to league leaders Chelsea on Boxing Day (Monday, 26 December), while Southampton do not play for another 10 days, when they host Tottenham on Wednesday, 28 December."

The manager got his tactics spot on.\"\nVictory leaves Spurs in fifth place in the table, but only one point behind rivals Arsenal, who lost 2-1 at Manchester City.\nAway-day woes\nThe Clarets got off to a good start and scored their first away goal of the season from open play courtesy of Barnes' opportunistic strike after haphazard Tottenham defending.\nBut the loss means they have picked up just one point from eight games on their travels this term.\nMore worryingly for Dyche's side will be their inability to create chances, with striker Andre Gray's effort straight at Hugo Lloris their only other shot on target.\nThe Lancashire side are just three points above the relegation zone and have important home games coming up against Middlesbrough and Sunderland.\nMan of the match - Kyle Walker (Tottenham)\nEngland full-back Walker's tireless running saw him make 76 sprints at a top speed of 33.33 km/h - better than any other team-mate. His 87 touches on the ball and five key passes was more than any other player on the pitch, while also contributing three tackles.\n'A cruel defeat'\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"In the Premier League it is very hard to win games. Today we knew Burnley are a team that fights a lot, run a lot and every ball they are ready to challenge.\n\"The team played in a very good way and we fully deserved the victory. I am pleased for that. It was a very difficult game.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"It is very cruel. We were very good today. A lot has been made of our away form but first half we were excellent and in the second we were at least decent against a top side.\"\nWalker glad to be of assistance\nSpurs have won 12 home games in the Premier League this calendar year; the most of any team in the competition.\nBurnley remain winless in London over their last 14 Premier League games, drawing two and losing 12.\nDele Alli has scored as many Premier League goals at White Hart Lane this season as he did in the whole of 2015-16 (2).\nFor the third time in 2016, Spurs fired in 30 or more shots (including blocks) in a Premier League game. Liverpool are the only other team to have done so on more than one occasion this year.\nThe Clarets are one of only two teams with Leicester yet to win a game away from home in the Premier League in 2016-17.\nKyle Walker has supplied more assists than any other defender in the Premier League this term (4).\nMoussa Sissoko has provided two assists as a substitute in the Premier League this season; a joint-high alongside Santi Cazorla and Demarai Gray.\nWhat's next?\nTottenham travel to face Southampton on 28 December (kick-off 19:45 GMT), while Burnley host Middlesbrough on Boxing Day (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Arsenal\nManchester City moved up to second in the Premier League table as Arsenal squandered a lead to lose for the second successive game.\nTheo Walcott's cool fifth-minute finish from Alexis Sanchez's pass put the Gunners in control at the interval - but the second half brought a familiar painful fate for manager Arsene Wenger and his players.\nAs at Everton on Tuesday, they were overpowered and the credits were rolling once Leroy Sane ran on to David Silva's pass to beat Petr Cech with Arsenal appealing in vain for offside.\nCity were on a roll and Arsenal were on the rack, the winner coming 19 minutes from time when Raheem Sterling was the beneficiary of Kevin de Bruyne's brilliant pass to arrow a low finish past Cech at his near post.\nIt bolstered City's title ambitions, although they are still seven points behind leaders Chelsea and completed a damaging double for Arsenal as they now lie nine points behind Antonio Conte's side.\nRelive the action from the Etihad Stadium\nDe Bruyne steps up as Ozil disappears\nManchester City needed their main man when they trailed at half-time - and in the absence of the suspended Sergio Aguero that role is assumed by De Bruyne.\nAnd how the Belgian responded, delivering a virtuoso second-half performance crowned by that superb pass that led to Sterling's winner.\nDe Bruyne was the driving force behind City's second-half transformation that saw Pep Guardiola's team wrestle control from Arsenal with a change of tempo and intensity that was simply too much for Arsenal to resist.\nThe same could not be said for Arsenal's elite players and the main culprit was Mesut Ozil who, as in the fierce atmosphere of Goodison Park on Tuesday, shrank from the occasion and wandered around aimlessly and ineffectively on the game's periphery.\nOzil is in the middle of what are likely to be very lucrative contract negotiations. Performances like this will diminish his hand in the bargaining rather than strengthen it.\nGood week for Guardiola and Man City...\nManchester City and Guardiola knew a lot was riding on two home games this week after the result, and the manner of the 4-2 defeat at Leicester City last Saturday.\nCity simply had to beat Watford and Arsenal, the stakes even higher after Chelsea stretched their lead to nine points with victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nA draw was no use to either side here - so the notion of defeat was even more unpalatable.\nCity were on the brink as they were behind at half-time but Guardiola responded by sending on Bacary Sagna for Pablo Zabaleta and Sane, who had been out on the wing, was soon racing through to score from a central position.\nIt was a win City needed desperately and its importance was illustrated by the celebrations at the final whistle.\n...bad week for Wenger and Arsenal\nJust when some of the old doubts about Arsenal's resilience and resistance to pressure seemed to be receding, all the familiar questions will return after the way they have lost a lead and slumped to defeat at Everton and now at Manchester City.\nArsenal looked in calm control holding the advantage on both occasions but have twice found themselves broken by physical presence and the greater intensity of opponents who were simply prepared to dig deeper.\nWenger was wearing a familiar frustrated expression at the final whistle.\nAnd at the back of many Arsenal minds will be the familiar tales and pain of previous seasons when promise and potential ended in title under-achievement.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nGuardiola's Indian sign over Wenger\nCity won a Premier League game they were losing at half-time for the first time since November 2012 (v Tottenham).\nMeanwhile, Arsenal have lost three games from leading positions this season, more than they did in the whole of 2015-16 (2).\nIndeed, the Gunners have lost back-to-back Premier League games having been leading for the first time since January 2012 (v Fulham and Swansea).\nGuardiola has yet to lose a home game against Wenger in any competition (W4 D1).\nSane became the sixth German player to score a Premier League goal for City - more than any other club has provided.\nSince joining Arsenal, Sanchez has had a hand in 59 Premier League goals (41 goals, 18 assists). Only Sergio Aguero (60 goals, 10 assists) has been involved in more in that time.\nSterling scored his first Premier League goal in nine games, since netting against Swansea in September.\nCech has gone eight Premier League games without a clean sheet for the first time in his career.\nWhat's next?\nIt's Boxing Day action for both teams. Arsenal are at home to West Brom (15:00 GMT) and City are at Hull (17:15 GMT)."

They have done so in style with away wins at Middlesbrough and now Everton.\nEverton's wait goes on\nEverton's record in Merseyside derbies has been a tale of almost unbroken misery since their last win, a 2-0 win against Roy Hodgson's Liverpool in October 2010.\nThere are, however, signs of improvement and they will feel unfortunate not to hold out here and concede so late on.\nFor the first 45 minutes they adhered to boss Ronald Koeman's demand for a high-intensity pressing game but ran out of steam after the break, not helped by the loss of James McCarthy to injury.\nSubstitute Gareth Barry may still possess the old guile, but sadly for him and Everton the legs are also ageing and he was miles off the pace - though his substitute appearance did take him second behind Ryan Giggs in the list of most Premier League games played.\nEverton also failed to give sufficient support to main marksman Romelu Lukaku and Koeman will surely be looking to address this problem in the January transfer window.\nThere are signs that the Toffees are now moving in the right direction, despite suffering their first home Premier League defeat of the season - but Koeman still has much to do.\nBarkley lucky not to see red\nBarkley has been the centre of much attention this season, whether as the victim of tough love from Koeman or with transfer speculation as he enters the last 18 months of his contract.\nHere he was centre of attention for different reasons after a late touchline lunge on his England team-mate Henderson in the second half that was somehow only punished with a yellow card.\nIt led to angry exchanges between the players, and Henderson and Barkley also clashed later, the latter wisely not rising to the Liverpool captain's bait.\nBarkley's night was summed up by a wild cross into the Gwladys Street that brought a furious response from his manager.\nThese are tough times for the talented 23-year-old midfielder.\nMan of the match - Ragnar Klavan (Liverpool)\n'You have to adapt to Everton's wild game' - what they said\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \"We are really disappointed to concede in extra time. The eight minutes killed us.\n\"We have to wait to see about Maarten Stekelenburg's injury - we will know more tomorrow - and James McCarthy has a hamstring injury.\n\"I know exactly how fast Sadio Mane is, he reacted so well. We did not deserve to concede this goal.\n\"Maybe Ross Barkley was lucky, it was a hard tackle.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \"I don't agree it was a poor first half. Maybe not the best football - you have to adapt to Everton's wild game. A game like this you have to interrupt their rhythm with passing.\n\"In the second half it was clear they couldn't do the same. We were better, we didn't give one chance away I think.\n\"The goal was not the hardest shot from Sturridge, but hard enough. It was a wonderful feeling.\n\"I don't like the flares too much. I'm a little bit scared about this. It was a long, long stoppage time. We gave them no chance.\"\nOn Barkley's tackle on Henderson: \"I saw it one time. Everything is clear. I think the referee had a difficult game. Maybe Ross was really lucky and Henderson was really lucky.\"\nEverton sucker punched, again - the best match stats\nEverton have only won one of their past 20 Premier League Merseyside derbies versus Liverpool, losing 10\nThis is Liverpool's fourth Premier League win over Everton that has come via a goal in the 90th minute or later\nLiverpool have won double the number of Premier League matches by 90th-minute winners against Everton than they have against any other opponent\nThe first shot on target came in the 50th minute - the second-longest wait in a Premier League match this season after Swansea v Sunderland (51st minute on 10 December)\nEverton did not manage a shot on target until the 75th minute\nWhat's up next?\nEverton travel to champions Leicester City on 26 December (15:00 GMT kick-off), before a trip to Hull on 30 December (20:00).

But today is the first game I don't like since I am here.\n\"Everything is happening to us because we had two injured players after 15 minutes and that can change any team, but still today the players could have done much better. It was not only one or two but many of them. So I am not happy with this.\n\"I am happy with the point and that Deeney scored his 100th goal - that had been a heavy weight he was carrying. Now this is over.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce, speaking to BBC Sport: \"The missed penalty, that was a big moment in the game, then we gave a soft penalty away when we had hardly looked in danger at all. We just didn't finish the opposition off.\n\"You are a bit apprehensive about what you have got, but from I have seen we have some real talent.

        "article_text": "Manchester United 3-1 Sunderland\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan scored a memorable goal as Manchester United beat struggling Sunderland to record their fourth successive Premier League win.\nUnited were the dominant side - enjoying 63% of possession and having a total of 25 shots on goal - but only a first-half Daley Blind effort separated the teams until the final 10 minutes.\nThe Dutchman was put through by a delightful Zlatan Ibrahimovic pass and fired low into the bottom-right corner for his first goal of the season, before United doubled their advantage with Paul Pogba setting up Ibrahimovic with eight minutes remaining.\nSubstitute Mkhitaryan added gloss to the scoreline with a brilliant backheeled 12-yard volley, which manager Jose Mourinho described as \"phenomenal\", though replays suggested the Armenian was offside.\nIt is a victory which draws United level with fifth-placed Tottenham, although the north Londoners have a game in hand, against Southampton on Wednesday.\nFabio Borini scored a wonderful late consolation for Sunderland, but defeat - their third in four games - leaves the Black Cats two points adrift of safety.\nReaction to Boxing Day matches\nUnited find their groove\nBoth halves belonged to the hosts and the passing statistics emphasised their dominance, with Mourinho's men making 606 passes compared to Sunderland's 177.\nBut the hosts were unable to shake off the visitors until the introduction of Mkhitaryan after the break added much-needed zip and verve.\nPogba was the stand-out player on the pitch, bossing play from the middle of the field and driving his team forward, and while Ibrahimovic played a part in all three goals it was Mkhitaryan who gave his side an extra dimension in attack.\nThe 27-year-old's strike was a special one, with the former Borussia Dortmund player, at the Stretford End, acrobatically directing Ibrahimovic's cross into net with the back of his heel.\n\"It's a pity it was the third goal of the game, not one that won the match because that would've been in Man United history,\" said Mourinho, who admitted his team were lucky to be ahead in the first half.\n\"He played for 25 minutes and played well and he's doing great things,\" added the United manager of the club's summer signing who is now impressing after initially struggling to make an impact.\nSunderland's struggles continue\nThis was David Moyes' first return to Old Trafford since his sacking as Manchester United manager in 2014.\nHis team, who have risen from the bottom of the table after a torrid start to the campaign, had their chances, with Victor Anichebe and Borini forcing a double save from David de Gea when the score was goalless.\nSunderland were positive in the first half and competed with the hosts, but paid the price for poor defending after the break, with Didier Ndong ceding possession to the commanding Pogba before the Frenchman put Ibrahimovic through for the second goal.\nScoring has been a problem for the Black Cats this season - they have found the next just five times away from home in the Premier League - and while Jermain Defoe came deep in search for the ball, nothing was created for Sunderland's prime poacher.\nIndeed, Sunderland ended the match with just six shots on goal, only three of which were on target.\nMOTD analysis\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer:\n\"Mkhitaryan's goal was just outrageous. It was brilliant. To even try that - we should be looking at that for the next six months, it was that good. It was brilliant ability to even try that.\"\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright:\n\"People did doubt Zlatan Ibrahimovic and there were games earlier in the season when he gave possession up too easily, but the quality that he has is showing now.\n\"If you give him time he can find runners and he looks so dangerous now. He has a lovely relationship going with Paul Pogba.\"\nMan of the Match - Paul Pogba (Manchester United)\nWhat the managers said\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"They did well to stop us and we were a bit lucky to be 1-0 in front.\n\"I didn't like the first-half performance. I was expecting us to start much better. I like the result. I like very much the second half.\n\"I know David and Sunderland deserved credit for what they did in the first half. Second half we had everything back - intensity, recover the ball high in the pitch, play fast passes and to have players like Anthony Martial and Henrikh Mkhitaryan on the bench helps.\n\"These are three important points. Four matches, 12 points - that's what we need.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"Up until 1-0 we had a good chance to get something out of the game, but we gave away a dreadful second goal and the third was offside.\n\"We hung in. We sort of stifled them, stuck at it and said if we could hold it at 1-0, they might get nervous in the last 10 minutes but we couldn't do it.\nPogba and Ibrahimovic in tune\nZlatan Ibrahimovic has been involved in 14 Premier League goals this season (12 goals, 2 assists) - at least eight more than any other Manchester United player.\nFabio Borini netted his first Premier League goal since May (against Chelsea).\nJose Mourinho has won four Premier League games in a row for the first time since April 2015, with Chelsea.\nAll three of Paul Pogba's assists in the Premier League this season have been for Ibrahimovic goals.\nMourinho's Premier League win rate at Man Utd is now 50%, the same as David Moyes' in his tenure at Old Trafford.\nWhat next?\nManchester United host Middlesbrough on 31 December before taking on West Ham on 2 January, while Sunderland travel to Burnley on 31 December before hosting Liverpool on 2 January."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-0 West Bromwich Albion\nArsenal striker Olivier Giroud headed a late winner as the Gunners ended a run of two Premier League defeats with victory over a stubborn West Brom to climb back to third.\nGiroud was making his first league start of the season and looped in an 86th minute header from a Mesut Ozil cross for his goal.\nUntil that moment the Gunners had enjoyed nearly 80% possession, but had struggled to find a way past inspired Baggies keeper Ben Foster.\nHe pulled off a number of key stops, including a double save when he parried an Alex Iwobi shot and blocked the rebound at the feet of Alexis Sanchez.\nThe 33-year-old former England keeper also tipped over a fizzing shot from Sanchez before West Brom nearly snatched a goal, with Claudio Yacob skying his shot over the bar after Arsenal keeper Petr Cech dropped a corner.\nBut Giroud finally broke the deadlock to keep Arsenal nine points behind leaders Chelsea, who beat Bournemouth.\nRelive Arsenal v West Brom\nFollow reaction to Saturday's games\nArsenal patience pays off\nArsenal had buckled in defeats by Everton and Manchester City in their previous two games and the focus was on how they would respond against one of the more resolute teams to beat in the top flight.\nIt seemed like they were still feeling the impact of those losses as they had just one shot on target in the first half, but they managed 10 after the break as they increased their intensity and urgency.\nSanchez was their main threat as the Chile forward tried to drag the Gunners single-handedly to three points but, like his team, he found himself being continually frustrated.\nSanchez seemed set to score when he evaded a number of defenders in a run across the six-yard box only to strike his shot against the post, before Arsenal's persistence was eventually rewarded through Giroud.\n\"It has been a big relief,\" said the France striker. \"We pushed to the end, kept believing in our game.\n\"We were very strong altogether and showed a good strong mentality. It was very important to win. We have shown a big mental strength.\"\nBaggies suffer late heartache again\nWest Brom keeper Foster said the defeat was \"tough to take\" for the Baggies as they were again undone by a late goal, having been beaten in their last away game at Chelsea by a 76th minute strike.\nArsenal's goal came even later, when the visitors were in sight of securing a point to show for their disciplined and determined defending.\nFoster, who signed a new deal with the club just before Christmas, can feel the most hard done by as he made 10 saves but still ended up on the losing side.\n\"It is disappointing to lose any game, but to keep Arsenal at bay for so long and then lose with a few minutes left it is horrible,\" said Foster.\n\"You know you're going to come here and, as a keeper, you're going to to be busy. The lads in front of me were brilliant. But fair play to Olivier Giroud - it was a great header and a great goal.\"\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\nWhat they said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"In the end we had to be patient against a well organised West Brom side.\n\"We knew we had to win today after two disappointing defeats.\"\nWenger on Giroud: \"It has been an interesting period for the player and it is important to see how he copes. It was a good reaction from him.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"It is hard to take. The players worked so hard. Arsenal are a good team and had lots of chances but to concede so late is disappointing.\n\"Olivier Giroud just outmuscled Gareth McAuley out of the way.\n\"Gareth said Giroud grabbed his shirt before the ball came over - I'm not sure if he did.\"\nOzil the provider - the key stats\nOlivier Giroud has scored seven goals in his past five starts for Arsenal in all competitions.\nArsenal had 23 more shots than West Brom today (26-3), their highest such margin in a Premier League match this season.\nMesut Ozil made his 100th Premier League appearance, and provided his 36th assist in the competition - only Eric Cantona had provided more after 100 games in the division (39).\nThe Gunners kept their first clean sheet in nine Premier League games, since a goalless draw with Middlesbrough in October.\nTony Pulis has lost all nine of his Premier League visits to the Emirates Stadium as manager, with his sides scoring just three goals in that run.\nWhat next?\nThe festive fixture programme sees West Brom travel to Southampton on New Year's Eve for a 15:00 kick-off in their next game, while Arsenal play a day later when they host Crystal Palace at 16:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-0 Middlesbrough\nVictor Valdes' late mistake gifted Burnley a scrappy Premier League victory over Middlesbrough at Turf Moor.\nThe former Barcelona and Manchester United goalkeeper allowed Andre Gray's 80th-minute strike to escape his grasp and sneak over the line to settle a combative contest that produced 11 bookings.\nThis was the first top-flight meeting between these teams since 1976 but few would lament a 40-year gap until the next one based on this evidence.\nBurnley had the better of the opening period, with Valdes saving from George Boyd and Ashley Barnes, while the visitors also went close through Cristhian Stuani.\nBut for the most part this was as an untidy game punctuated by countless stoppages for referee Craig Pawson to issue cautions, with five coming in the first half and six after the break.\nThat will be of no concern to Burnley, however, who have now reaped 19 of their 20 points at Turf Moor this season and are six points clear of relegation danger.\nBoro, meanwhile, are without an away win in eight games and remain four points clear of trouble.\nRelive the action at Turf Moor\nReaction to all the Boxing Day fixtures\nA fitting end to a scrappy game\nGray's first goal since August came after some classic route-one football by the hosts.\nGoalkeeper Tom Heaton's long kick upfield was flicked by Sam Vokes into the path of the former Brentford striker, whose first-time shot from just inside the area showed great instinct and technique but, in truth, was too close to the goalkeeper.\nValdes got down to get his hands to the ball, but he allowed it to squirm away from his body and over the line to send Boro to defeat.\nThe 79 minutes to that point had produced little in the way of quality, with Valdes equal to Barnes' low drive in the first half and then saving a little unconvincingly from Boyd's swerving 25-yard shot.\nBoro striker Stuani spurned a hat-trick of presentable openings for the visitors, firing wide in the first half after latching on to Antonio Barragan's long ball and then seeing two headers from second-half corners fail to seriously test Heaton.\nThe only other talking point of note came in the first half, when Boro defender Calum Chambers appeared to handle from Dean Marney in the area but the referee was not interested.\nBurnley's home comforts continue\nShould Sean Dyche's Burnley players find themselves celebrating Premier League survival come May, they will have their home form to thank, with 95% of their points haul so far having come at Turf Moor.\nThis victory - their sixth of the season - means they are already halfway to the 40 points generally regarded as the minimum required to avoid relegation.\nIt also ended a miserable run that had seen the Clarets lose their last three Boxing Day games without scoring, although 12 months ago a 3-0 loss on 26 December was the trigger for a 23-match unbeaten run that saw Burnley to the Championship title.\nStrugglers Sunderland are the next visitors to Turf Moor on New Year's Eve, while February also looks favourable for Dyche's side, with Southampton and Leicester City their league visitors.\nMOTD analysis\nFormer Burnley striker Ian Wright:\n\"I saw Burnley a few weeks ago and they missed Andre Gray's pace. When you play him up with Sam Vokes they play close together and cause a lot of problems. Burnley have to play two up front at home and batter teams. Their home record is great.\"\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer:\n\"I think Middlesbrough and Burnley will both be very pleased with the progress they've shown after 18 games. Both are in reasonably comfortable positions.\"\nMan of the match - George Boyd (Burnley)\nMatch stats - Gray ends 10-game drought\nBurnley secured their first win in their last seven league games against Middlesbrough (D2 L4)\nMiddlesbrough have enjoyed just one win in their last 22 away Premier League games (D6 L15)\nBurnley have found the back of the net in eight of their last nine top-flight games at Turf Moor\nMiddlesbrough didn't have a shot on target until the 60th minute, via Gaston Ramirez\nAndre Gray bagged his first goal in his last 10 Premier League appearances\nGray scored with his only shot of the game\nSam Vokes has been directly involved in six Premier League goals this season (four goals, two assists) - two more than any other Burnley player\nManager reaction\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We've had to work very hard for it. It was a close game and an ugly game at times. In defence of both teams, I must say conditions were really hard today - the wind was swirling and the ball was going all over the place.\n\"We knew they weren't going to come and be easy to knock over, but we finally got there in the end with a good finish.\n\"I was pleased with Andre. Obviously their keeper might be disappointed but he takes it early, takes it with power and takes it with freedom. He's got that about him, where he will take on a chance and not be afraid to miss and that's a fantastic thing to have.\"\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"It was a game completely under control. It is frustrating.\n\"We had chances and we could have prevented their goal. They had a lot of long balls and we knew that this was the only way they could score. We must learn.\"\nWhat's next?\nThe New Year's Eve fixtures are next up for these two as Burnley host Sunderland and Middlesbrough hit the road again to play Manchester United.

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-2 Everton\nKevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku fired Everton to their first away win since September as champions Leicester dropped closer to the relegation places.\nBelgium winger Mirallas capitalised on a lapse in concentration in the Leicester defence when he latched on to a long ball from goalkeeper Joel Robles, and struck a low shot into the corner of the net.\nDaniel Amartey, Leonardo Ulloa and Demarai Gray brought saves out of Robles but Everton added a second goal in injury time.\nA long ball from Ross Barkley found Lukaku, who showed great strength before firing the ball past Kasper Schmeichel in the Leicester goal.\nEverton's victory was their first on the road since a 3-0 win at Sunderland on 12 September.\nFollow Boxing Day's Premier League football\nRelive Everton's victory\nLapse in concentration costs Foxes\nLeicester's remarkable Premier League title success last season was underpinned by their defensive fortitude, but sloppy errors are costing them this term.\nFinal Score pundit Trevor Sinclair said the Foxes backline were \"daydreaming\" for Mirallas' goal.\nLeiceister defenders Wes Morgan and Marcin Wasilewski allowed a long punt from keeper Robles to bounce and Mirallas was on to it as quick as a flash for his third goal in as many games against the Foxes.\nThe hosts had committed men forward for Everton's second goal late on, but the ease with which Lukaku shrugged off the attentions of the same duo emphasised how they can be exposed against direct balls and pace.\nIt was also another reminder for Leicester's players and fans of how unforgiving the Premier League can be as the champions dropped to 16th in the table, three points above the relegation places.\nEverton more pragmatic and clinical\nEverton executed Ronald Koeman's game plan to perfection at King Power Stadium as they beat Leicester on their own patch for the first time since 1997.\nThe Toffees soaked up the pressure and had the pace and power to hurt the home side on the counter-attack.\nUnder Koeman's predecessor Roberto Martinez, Everton were certainly more aesthetically pleasing to watch, but it is results that count.\nKoeman has made the Toffees more versatile to adapt to their opponents' strengths and expose their weaknesses.\nA top-six finish does not look beyond them and this victory lifted them to seventh.\nChilwell looks a star of the future\nDespite conceding twice, it was not all doom and gloom for Leicester given an impressive showing from one of their rising stars.\nLiverpool were strongly linked with Ben Chilwell in the summer - despite the fact he had not even made a first-team appearance for the Foxes - but the Leicester left-back signed a new five-year contract instead.\nIt is easy to see why Reds boss Jurgen Klopp was so interested in the 20-year-old based on his Premier League debut as he barely put a foot wrong with a mature and accomplished performance.\nNot too dissimilar in style to opposite number Leighton Baines, his positional play and reading of the game were excellent. The England Under-21 international, who was on loan at Huddersfield last season, also made plenty of overlapping runs going forward.\nLeicester's first-choice left-back Christian Fuchs missed this game as he served a one-match suspension, which leaves Claudio Ranieri with something of dilemma for his next match.\n\"I've waited a while for my Premier League debut and I wanted to show I am up to the level,\" Chilwell said. \"There's a lot of games coming up so hopefully I'll be in the manager's thoughts.\"\nMOTD analysis\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright:\n\"Leicester need to get themselves going, they really do. They are starting to get in serious trouble now.\"\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer:\n\"That's one win in nine for Leicester, but I thought Everton were worthy winners. They were more aggressive, a little bit more direct. Leicester were missing Christian Fuchs and, in particular, Robert Huth.\"\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\n'Everything was right, now it's wrong' - what they said\nLeicester City boss Claudio Ranieri: \"We were in control but suddenly there was a long kick and we reacted a little late and they scored.\n\"After that we were nervous, and controlled the match much better. This season is this way - nothing is right, nothing is easy. We have to work and react. That's our medicine. We have to stay together in the bad moment.\n\"We wanted to give a good present on Boxing Day, but it was not possible. Here everything was right in the first six months and now everything is wrong.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"We played well, the second half was better than the first. Our ball possession was better after 1-0 and that's a question of confidence.\n\"I think we had chances to score more goals. It was a good team performance, with fight. We defended well and were good on the counter-attack.\n\"We know the Premier League is tough and we need to prepare ourselves for Hull now. This gives us confidence.\"\nRobles becomes 50th keeper with an assist - the best match stats\nThe Foxes have not won a Premier League Boxing Day match since beating Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 in 1998 (D1 L6)\nEverton are unbeaten in their last five Premier League away games on Boxing Day (W3 D2 L0)\nJoel Robles became the 50th different goalkeeper to provide an assist in the Premier League\nRomelu Lukaku has scored seven of Everton's 11 Premier League away goals this season (64%)\nKevin Mirallas has scored in each of his last three Premier League appearances against Leicester\nEverton have lost just two of their last 14 Premier League games against a reigning champion (W7 D5 L2)\nWhat's next?\nLeicester have another home game against West Ham on New Year's Eve (15:00 GMT).

Conte takes journalists for Christmas drink\nNo Costa or Kante, not much difference\nChelsea were missing two key components of their recent run, with striker Diego Costa and midfielder N'Golo Kante both suspended, but it made little difference.\nWithout Costa to lead the line, and the Blues \u00a333m Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi again left on the bench, Antonio Conte went with a front three of Hazard, Willian and Pedro.\nIt took time for them to hit their stride but the three players eventually proved an effective combination.\nThey were happy to swap positions throughout the game but all three caused the Cherries problems when they ran at them, especially on the break.\n\"This is the first time we played without a real forward,\" Chelsea manager Conte explained.\n\"We tried this in training and I think for us at the moment this situation is the best, but I don't forget Michy because he is a young player with great talent.

There's no excuse for the second goal. Winston Reid gets above the two defenders - there's no way he should win the ball - but he gets above them because he wants it more, it means more to him.\n\"It was a big punt bringing Bob Bradley in, with his lack of experience of Premier League players and lack of experience in the Premier League. It was always going to be a big ask of him to keep Swansea up.\"\nFormer West Ham forward Ian Wright:\n\"It was starting to get tight for West Ham and Slaven Bilic had to dig the players out after the 5-1 defeat to Arsenal at the start of December. The players needed to hear that.\"\nMan of the match - Andy Carroll (West Ham)\nSwansea's shaky defence\nSwansea have shipped 29 goals in the top flight since Bob Bradley took charge on 15 October, more than any other side.\nSwansea have conceded the first goal in 13 Premier League games this season, only Hull have done so more often.\nWest Ham have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March.\nAndre Ayew is the 41st player to score both for and against West Ham in the Premier League, more than any other club has seen.\nDimitri Payet has provided 15 Premier League assists in 2016, more than any other player.\nWhat next?\nSwansea host Bournemouth on New Year's Eve before taking on Crystal Palace on 3 January. West Ham travel to Leicester on 31 December and face Manchester United at home on 2 January."

        "article_text": "Hull City 0-3 Manchester City\nManchester City climbed to second place in the Premier League with a workmanlike victory over bottom side Hull City at the KCOM stadium.\nPep Guardiola's visitors were far from their free-flowing best en route to their 12th win of the season, but were nevertheless good value for a victory that keeps them seven points behind leaders Chelsea.\nYaya Toure's penalty, awarded after Andrew Robertson's clumsy challenge on Raheem Sterling, set the visitors on their way before Kelechi Iheanacho added a second from close range and Curtis Davies conceded an own goal in the last few seconds.\nHull have now conceded nine penalties so far in the league this season - four more than any other side.\nThe hosts played well in patches and saw Michael Dawson's second-half header cleared off the line by Bacary Sagna, but their return of one win in 16 matches is a damning statistic that points to only one outcome at the end of the season.\nAnd it will not be lost on Tigers fans that the side bottom on Christmas Day have only stayed up three times in the 24 Premier League seasons to date.\nRelive Man City's win at the KCOM Stadium\nPatience pays off for Man City\nGuardiola's players will not earn many style points for this latest win but the final result is all that matters as they bid to keep in touch with Antonio Conte's flying leaders.\nAfter starting December with back-to-back losses to Chelsea and champions Leicester, Man City now appear to be comfortably back in the winning groove with nine points from nine.\nSergio Aguero was sitting out the final game of his four-match ban and his absence appeared to be felt in a first half of few chances.\nGuardiola decided against employing out-and-out striker Iheanacho from the start in favour of a four-man forward line of Kevin de Bruyne, Sterling, David Silva and Nolito, and they did not click into gear until after the break.\nAnd Sterling took centre stage with a probing run into the area which proved the turning point, drawing a needless foul from Robertson that presented Toure with a chance from 12 yards that he did not pass up.\nIheanacho, introduced from the bench in the 57th minute, added a simple second after good work by Silva, before more direct running from Sterling forced Davies to turn into his own net in the fourth minute of added time.\nThe only real scare for Guardiola during the match was the early withdrawal of England defender John Stones through injury, but his concerns were quickly allayed.\n\"We were a little bit worried about that but it is just a kick, not ligaments or something like that,\" said Guardiola.\nHull pay the penalty\nHull have conceded the first goal of the game a league-high 15 times this season, but the rate at which the Tigers are shipping penalties is an even more alarming statistic.\nWith nine conceded so far, Mike Phelan's men are giving away spot-kicks at the rate of one every two matches.\nBut they have committed just 186 fouls in 18 games so far - just four teams have conceded fewer - meaning they have given away one penalty for every 20.6 fouls committed.\nA mixture of poor judgement and ill fortune lurk behind most of those spot-kicks - two things the Tigers could do without if they are to escape from trouble.\nShould they continue to give up penalties at even half the present rate, they will comfortably eclipse the Premier League record of 11 penalties conceded in a season, held by the Blackburn team of 2006-07.\nMan of the match - Yaya Toure (Man City)\nSilva shows his class again - match stats\nManchester City have won three consecutive Premier league games for the first time since their run of six from the start of the current season (which ended in September)\nHull have won just one of their last 16 top-flight games, drawing three and losing 12\nCity registered just their second clean sheet in their last 12 top flight away games\nOnly Jamie Vardy (10) has won more penalties in the Premier League since the start of the 2013/14 season than Raheem Sterling (7)\nDavid Silva (61) has provided more Premier League assists than any other player in the competition since his debut in August 2010\nKelechi Iheanacho has netted 12 Premier League goals from just 19 shots on target\n'We forgot where the goal was' - manager reaction\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola: \"I enjoyed it because we won but like always had to work hard for it.\n\"In the first half we forgot where the goal was, in the second half, our strikers saw the goal a bit more and after the first goal it was easy.\n\"There is always pressure for us because the top of the league is tough and the other teams at the top had won today. Every game we play is like a final.\"\nHull manager Mike Phelan: \"The penalty was the major turning point. Andrew Robertson is heartbroken over it because he knows he has suffered a harsh lesson there - he has got to stay on his feet and shuffle the player across into an area where maybe his team-mate can do a little bit better at making an attempt to tackle.\n\"But he has learned from that, and he will learn a lot more at this level. He is a good young player, and a good kid to have around but he has made a basic, basic mistake that has cost us.\n\"Until then, we put everything together the best way we could. I thought we were very very solid and moved the ball around well. We got to their players quickly and definitely frustrated them. We caused them a few problems now and again.\"\nWhat's next?\nMan City face a big away trip to Liverpool on New Year's Eve (17:30 GMT), while Hull are back in action on Friday, 30 December when Everton visit the KCOM Stadium (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 4-1 Stoke City\nLiverpool closed the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to six points and moved to second in the league after maintaining their unbeaten home record with a convincing victory over Stoke.\nJon Walters headed home at his near post, highlighting the home team's vulnerability in defence, to give Stoke an early lead.\nBut Liverpool responded positively after a disjointed start, with Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino scoring before the break as the hosts took the lead.\nJurgen Klopp's men made sure of the win, which moves them one point ahead of third-placed Manchester City - whom they play on New Year's Eve - when Giannelli Imbula directed Divock Origi's cross into his own net.\nAdding gloss to the scoreline was Daniel Sturridge, who scored his first league goal of the season - and Liverpool's 100th under manager Klopp.\nReaction to Liverpool's victory at Anfield\n'Liverpool are serious title contenders'\nLiverpool recover after iffy start\nThere was a period in the first half when Liverpool looked exposed. Simon Mignolet, again preferred in goal to Loris Karius as Klopp stuck to the team which started the derby win against Everton, should have saved Walters' close-range header.\nIt was a mistake which will once again open up the debate over who should be the manager's first-choice goalkeeper. But, in attack, the Reds were as quick, incisive and destructive as they have been throughout the season.\nLiverpool have now scored 86 league goals in 2016 - their most in a calendar year since 1985 - and they ended the match having made a total of 20 shots, six of which were on target.\nOnce the impressive Lallana equalised, sweeping home from an acute angle after Glen Johnson failed to clear the danger inside his six-yard box, Liverpool were completely dominant.\nAnd there was a sense of inevitability when Firmino, allowed to turn unchallenged in the box, scored - his low shot bouncing in off the far and then near post.\nAs has been the case for the majority of this season, Sadio Mane and James Milner were key cogs, with the latter's tireless runs down the left flank giving Stoke an extra worry.\nStoke in another sticky run\nStoke, now winless in four league games, caused Liverpool's defence a number of problems in the first half, with former players Peter Crouch and Joe Allen instrumental for the Potters.\nCrouch, starting for the first time since August, held the ball up well while the tigerish Allen played like a man eager to prove a point to the club that sold him to Stoke for \u00a313m in the summer. Indeed, the Welshman could have doubled the visiting team's advantage but instead forced a fine save from Mignolet.\nStoke sought to contain their opponents by attacking them and it was a ploy which worked until Liverpool levelled and Mark Hughes' men suddenly found themselves penned inside their own half as the hosts confidently sprayed the ball around.\nDefensive errors contributed to Stoke's downfall. The visitors ceded possession too easily in their own half for Liverpool's third and Ryan Shawcross' clumsy pass back to goalkeeper Lee Grant allowed Sturridge a clear run through for a goal the striker described as a \"gift\".\nHaving recovered from a terrible start to the season, Stoke now find themselves in another sticky run, though there is a seven-point cushion between them and the relegation zone.\nMan of the Match - James Milner (Liverpool)\nWhat the managers say\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a very difficult game. The result doesn't show it, but it was difficult because it was the third or fourth time we have played Stoke with Crouch on the pitch and that is a sign of how they want to play.\n\"It is difficult to defend. Maybe we could do better when we had the ball but we did not have enough patience in our own possession and the long balls are really difficult to defend. When he is 45 maybe they will still bring him in.\n\"We then scored a wonderful goal and then the second one. We regrouped again and told the players that the movement was not as good as it could be and we controlled the game.\n\"It was pretty clear Stoke cannot play the same half again. It was intense for them, they pressed high and were aggressive. We did better with the ball and deserved this result.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We are disappointed. We came here with a positive game plan. In the first half we caused Liverpool real problems and didn't allow them to play their game.\n\"We created great chances and scored a great goal. We could have made it 2-0 but then we made mistakes and find ourselves 2-1 down and I think that was harsh on us.\n\"You come here and chase the game and the danger is getting picked off but we made mistakes and that is the disappointment.\"\nSturridge makes an impact\nDaniel Sturridge netted his first league goal of the season, with what was his 21st attempt on goal\nSturridge scored 56 seconds after coming onto the field, the fourth fastest substitute goal in the Premier League this season\nStoke have conceded seven goals in their past two away games in the Premier League, just one fewer than they conceded in their first seven away trips of the season (8)\nRoberto Firmino has scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than any other Liverpool player (15)\nThe Reds conceded the first goal in a Premier League game at Anfield for the first time since May (1-1 against Chelsea)\nJonathan Walters' header that opened the scoring was the 500th goal of the current Premier League season\nThe Potters have scored more own goals than any other Premier League team this season (3), with all three coming away from home\nWhat next?\nIn a busy festive period, Liverpool host Manchester City on New Year's Eve (17:30 GMT) before kicking off at Sunderland only 46 hours later. Stoke travel to Stamford Bridge on New Year's Eve (15:00 GMT) to take on league leaders Chelsea and then host Watford on 3 January (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur\nDele Alli scored twice as Tottenham maintained their challenge for a Champions League spot with victory over 10-man Southampton.\nSaints took the lead in the second minute when defender Virgil van Dijk demonstrated his aerial threat by nodding in James Ward-Prowse's free-kick.\nThe visitors were level just before midway in the half when Alli out-jumped Van Dijk to direct Moussa Sissoko's deflected cross past keeper Fraser Forster.\nShortly after the break, Harry Kane ended his run of three league games without a goal when he headed in from Christian Eriksen's corner in the 52nd minute.\nAnd the England forward should have extended his side's advantage moments later when Southampton's Nathan Redmond brought down Alli in the area to concede a penalty and earn a red card. However Kane fired the spot-kick over the bar.\nThe sending off changed the complexion of the match as Spurs took advantage of the extra space, with both substitute Son Heung-Min and Alli firing in low strikes to put gloss on the win.\nSpurs remain in fifth spot, but are now only a point behind fourth-place Arsenal.\nRelive the action from St Mary's Stadium\n'With 10 men they were never going to come back'\nWas it a red card?\nThere was confusion on social media as to whether Redmond's foul on Alli warranted a red card in the 57th minute.\nThe Saints midfielder pulled back his Spurs counterpart in the area which prompted referee Mike Dean to point to the spot. The official then, after a delay, sent the England Under-21 international off.\nUnder new rules, had Redmond tried to win the ball with a tackle he would have received just a caution. However, the pull meant it was both a penalty and red card offence.\nKane & Alli send message to rivals\nThe England internationals scored 35 league goals between them last season as Spurs finished third - and they are on course to emulate that feat this campaign.\nAlli led the way against what was the third meanest defence in the league coming into the match.\nHe brought Spurs back into the contest with a majestic leap above 6ft 4in Van Dijk to nod Sissoko's delivery past Forster. And showed composure to fire past the England keeper in the closing minutes.\nKane had the second fewest touches of all outfield players in the first half, but after the break the 23-year-old scored with his first effort on target when he headed in from Eriksen's set-piece in the 52nd minute.\nHe should have added his ninth league goal of the season soon after but his standing foot slipped as he fired over from the penalty spot.\nAfter the match, Kane suggested a brand new square of turf on the penalty spot might have been the cause for his miss.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli (Tottenham)\n'Important for us to keep fighting'\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was a difficult game from the start. It was hard to settle but we prepared in the way we wanted to in order to play against Southampton.\n\"It was unlucky for us to concede early in the first half but after 10-15 minutes we started to come into the game and push a little harder. We certainly deserved the victory.\n\"It was important for Kane and Alli as brilliant offensive players to score goals and I am very pleased with their performances.\n\"All the top sides have won over the festive period so it was important for us to keep fighting and after that I think we are in a good position.\"\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"With the red card it was too difficult to come back and we conceded another two goals. The red card is the end of the game for us.\n\"The two players went for the ball, I don't know I didn't see the action. This gave Spurs the opportunity to win the game.\"\nNew Spurs record\nSpurs are unbeaten in their last five visits to St Mary's, with four wins and a draw.\nSpurs' win means they have claimed 71 points in 2016, a new club record in the Premier League (surpassing their haul of 70 in 2013).\nThis is the first time that Southampton have conceded four goals in a Premier League home game since November 1998 (1-4 v Aston Villa).\nThere have been 10 comeback wins in the Premier League in December 2016 - the last month to see more was December 2013 (12).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton are at home to West Brom on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and Tottenham are at Watford on New Year's Day (13:30 GMT)."

The draw moves them up one place to 19th, but they are still three points away from moving out of the relegation zone.\nHull twice took the lead but their defensive vulnerabilities came to the fore in the closing stages as Barkley was allowed a free header for his goal.\nIt means the East Yorkshire side have now conceded 41 goals this season, a joint-league high alongside fellow strugglers Swansea.\nThey have also failed to keep a clean sheet at the KCOM Stadium this term and have collected just one win from their last 17 games.\nWith the January transfer window about to open, Phelan will be looking to bring in reinforcements, while also hoping to hold on the impressive Snodgrass.\nAgeing Everton falter in defence\nRonald Koeman's side continued to show the inconsistency that has been a factor of their season.\nThey had won two out of their three matches before this game - yet before that, had picked up just one victory from 10 fixtures.\nLike opponents Hull, they displayed defensive issues once again - Koeman's team have managed only four clean sheets in 19 Premier League matches under his leadership.\nA centre-back will be on the list of priorities for the manager as Phil Jagielka, 34, looked to struggle at times.\nThe 35-year-old Gareth Barry - who came close with a drive in the first half - lasted 65 minutes, and it remains to be seen whether a transfer window move for Manchester United midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin materialises.\nEverton could have won it late on but substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed wide from a couple of yards out and the point leaves them in seventh, six points adrift of sixth-placed United, who host Middlesbrough on Saturday.\nMan of the match - Robert Snodgrass (Hull)\n'The team showed good spirit'\nHull boss Mike Phelan, speaking to BBC Sport about almost losing at the end: \"That's the nature of the beast. We play well and we get beat. I'm pleased. For three or four weeks we've put in a shift and got nothing. We could be greedy and ask for more but I'm proud of the players.\n\"Robert Snodgrass has shown his quality on his free-kicks this season. We need those things. The top league demands top players to score top goals.\n\"We need more goals from all areas. We need to tighten up. We have a lot of work to do. It's now a case of trying to bring people in and give us a chance going forward.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \"I'm really pleased tonight about our performance. I wasn't happy with our slow start but we showed a really good attitude and reaction twice.\n\"We played good football and created a lot of opportunities. We could have stopped the first goal but not the second. The team showed good spirit. We created maybe the most chances today.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer England defender Danny Mills on BBC Radio 5 live:\nHull boss Mike Phelan will be thinking what could have been. They took the lead twice and threw it away to a free header.\nOverall, it was a thoroughly entertaining game. It was was scrappy and frantic at times but a draw is a fair result.\nRobert Snodgrass was excellent, but not just for his set pieces, but his all-round play too.\nRoss Barkley came up with a fantastic header for the equaliser, but striker Romelu Lukaku was kept quiet.\nWhat next?\nHull start 2017 when they travel to face West Brom in the league on 2 January (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Everton host Southampton at the same time.\nMarshall's curse\nHull have gone 21 matches without a clean sheet in all competitions - their worst run since January 1991 (22 games).\nRobert Snodgrass has been involved in 50% of Hull's Premier League goals this season (six goals, two assists).\nSnodgrass and Stoke's Xherdan Shaqiri have both scored two direct free-kicks - no player has scored more this season.\nNo Premier League side this season have scored more headed goals than Everton (nine).\nNo Premier League defender has scored more goals this season than Hull's Michael Dawson (three).\nDavid Marshall has now played 14 Premier League games for Hull without a clean sheet. Only two goalkeepers have played more games for a Premier League club before keeping a clean sheet - Julian Speroni at Crystal Palace (16 games) and John Ruddy at Norwich (20 games)."

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-2 West Bromwich Albion\nHal Robson-Kanu scored a stunning winner on his first Premier League start since May 2013 as West Brom came from behind to beat Southampton.\nThe Wales international spearheaded a well-drilled West Brom outfit, but they conceded possession all too easily in the first half and fell behind to Shane Long's powerful header.\nThey levelled within two minutes when Robson-Kanu turned Chris Brunt's first-time pass into the path of Matt Phillips, who finished neatly.\nThe Baggies were perhaps fortunate not to have Allan Nyom sent off before half-time, and they took full advantage when Robson-Kanu slammed left-footed into the top corner from 20 yards.\nRelive Kanu's stunner and West Brom's win\nAll the reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nRobson-Kanu was the only change to the side beaten at Arsenal, and boss Tony Pulis was rewarded with a show of determination and organisation as Saints had few clear-cut chances.\nThe hosts, who made six changes following a 4-1 loss to Spurs, were blunt and ultimately exposed by their efficient visitors, their day made worse when Virgil van Dijk was shown a second yellow for pulling back Salomon Rondon on 88 minutes.\nHome fans headed for the exit in their droves as Van Dijk was dismissed. Their side are ninth, a place behind West Brom.\nPulis and Robson-Kanu get it right\nRobson-Kanu - introduced 13 times from the bench this season - last started a Premier League match while playing for Reading.\nAnd his performance, having replaced top scorer Rondon in the starting XI, was symptomatic of how right Pulis got things at St Mary's.\nThe fact goalkeeper Ben Foster's 37 passes were more than any of his team-mates highlights just how bad the Baggies were in possession, but they outmanoeuvred their hosts, limiting them to harmless crosses.\nJonny Evans fielded aerial challenges admirably, while Phillips deserves praise for his calm leveller and a neat reverse pass which sent Robson-Kanu free for the game's standout moment of quality.\nThe match-winning strike was as powerful as it was accurate, beating Fraser Forster at his near post to give Robson-Kanu his first goal since a sublime effort against Belgium at Euro 2016.\nPulis admitted his side were \"shocking\" in the opening period, citing a cancelled flight on Friday and enforced bus travel as a potential reason for the slow start.\nBut he too deserves credit. He refused to make widespread changes in the wake of back-to-back defeats and, at the halfway stage of the season, his side are three points and five places better off than at this stage of 2015-16.\nBlunt Saints stuttering\nSaints boss Claude Puel said changing more than half his side was a result of fixture congestion and not a knee-jerk move after the defeat by Tottenham.\nThe French boss has now made four or more changes in each of their last five league games. His latest selection saw Southampton unable to pick a final pass of meaning in 94 minutes.\nThere were glimmers of flair from Sofiane Boufal but, the goals aside, West Brom could claim the game's best chance when James Morrison's header was saved with the Baggies 2-1 up.\nSouthampton may feel Nyom should have been dismissed for clattering Long nine minutes after being booked.\nBut the fact they have only won two league games in a row once this season shows their inconsistency.\nAt the halfway stage of the season they are three places better off than at the same stage in 2015-16 but have scored seven goals fewer. It is not hard to see why.\nMan of the match - Matt Phillips\nManager quotes - 'Who do I pick?'\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"We started well, with possession and quality, and then the first chance for the opponent they score. It's a difficult moment for the squad. We have to concentrate more in defence.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"In the first half we were shocking really, way off the pace of the game. But in the second half we got going and we played with a lot more purpose.\n\"Robson-Kanu has been very good. We felt it was the right time to give Salomon Rondon a rest, he was a little bit down in training this week. Now I have a problem Monday... who do I pick?\"\nThe stats - Should Phillips make your fantasy team?\nSouthampton have lost successive Premier League home games for the first time since 8 December 2014.\nWest Brom scored more than once for only the second time in their past 15 Premier League away games.\nMatt Phillips has been involved in 10 goals in his 18 Premier League games this season (four goals, six assists).\nThere was just one minute 47 seconds between Long's goal and Matt Phillips' equaliser.\nUp next?\nWest Brom host second-bottom Hull City on Monday in a 15:00 GMT kick-off, while Southampton will face former manager Ronald Koeman when they travel to Everton at the same time."

        "article_text": "Burnley 4-1 Sunderland\nAndre Gray became the first Burnley player to score a Premier League hat-trick as the Clarets comfortably defeated a poor Sunderland side.\nGray, who was playing in the sixth tier of English football with Hinckley United in 2012, netted his first after a defensive mix-up between John O'Shea and Papy Djilobodji.\nThe striker rounded Vito Mannone for his second before completing his treble with a low shot from Ashley Barnes' pass.\nBarnes converted a penalty to make it 4-0, before a consolation goal from Jermain Defoe after good play from Adnan Januzaj.\nMoyes angry at 'dire' Sunderland\n, external\nRelive Burnley's win over Sunderland as it happened\nReaction from Saturday's other Premier League games\nHow the goals went in\n31 mins (1-0, Gray): Centre-halves O'Shea and Djilobodji both challenged for the same ball, it hit O'Shea's shoulder and bounced backwards. The ball fell to Gray who ran through and his shot was too powerful for Mannone.\n51 mins (2-0, Gray): A speculative ball was hit forward and Gray held off a challenge from Djilobodji and got to the ball before Mannone, who had sprinted out of his penalty area. Gray rounded the keeper and put it into an empty net.\n53 mins (3-0, Gray): Sunderland substitute Steven Pienaar stood on the ball and that allowed Burnley to hit a ball into Barnes, who had time and space to pick a pass to Gray and he steered his shot past Mannone.\n67 mins (4-0, Barnes): Barnes converted a spot-kick after Seb Larsson had bundled Scott Arfield to the floor in the penalty area.\n71 mins (4-1, Defoe): Januzaj dinked in a pass to the back post that evaded the head of Ben Mee. Defoe took a touch to set himself and shot from close range past Tom Heaton.\nSunderland's injury and defensive problems continue\nSunderland end 2016 in the relegation zone and boss David Moyes will surely be furious with a woeful performance from his side.\nThey have a lengthy injury list that includes Jordan Pickford, Paddy McNair, Lee Cattermole, Jan Kirchhoff and Duncan Watmore and they suffered more problems at Turf Moor.\nDefender Lamine Kone went off after clattering into an advertising hoarding, before striker Victor Anichebe pulled up with a hamstring injury.\nKone's injury proved crucial as Sunderland were terrible defensively from that point onwards. Three of the four goals came from simple balls forward that should have been dealt with, while the fourth came after a rash challenge.\nTo make things worse for the Black Cats, they could now lose Wahbi Khazri (Tunisia) and Didier Ndong (Gabon) to the Africa Cup of Nations in January, with Moyes unlikely to have much money to spend in the transfer window.\nSunderland are in their 10th successive campaign in the top flight and only avoided relegation from the Premier League in the penultimate game of last season. Many more defensive performances like this will see them ending 2017 in the Championship.\nMan of the match - Andre Gray (Burnley)\nStats - Clarets continue to impress at home\nAll but one of Burnley's 23 Premier League points this season have been earned at home.\nBurnley are the first newly promoted Premier League side to win seven of their first 11 home games since Charlton Athletic in 2000-01.\nSunderland have lost four successive away games for the first time since November 2015, conceding 12 goals and scoring only two.\nDefoe has now scored in 130 Premier League games. Only Alan Shearer, Andy Cole, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney have scored in more matches.\nWhat they said\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"This has been a good week for sure, the end of a good calendar year for us at Burnley.\n\"I'm pleased with our calmness today, and we felt we could get the ball down more. We want to mix our football and we were productive. Andre Gray got his hat-trick today, great for both himself and the team.\n\"We'd like to think we are a persistent team, though the Premier League is a tough division and whoever you play won't make it easy. We have to do what we can, be effective, and I think we were today. We are learning about how to deal with this league.\n\"We don't overthink every game, but we always want to challenge. You have got to get points on the board and so far this season we have done that. As a unit, we think we can be effective, can be a real team and take this challenge on.\"\nBurnley striker Andre Gray, who also scored in the 1-0 win over Middlesbrough on 26 December, added: \"It's been a massive week, two big wins against the teams around us.\n\"It's massive for me to score a hat-trick - four years ago I never thought I'd be playing in the Premier League, never mind scoring three in one game. I have had to work hard, do the right things and hope that it'll pay off. Today, obviously it has.\n\"We are only halfway through the season though - a lot can change. We need to dig in and stay up.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"We were dire today, really, really bad. It was a poor performance, and defensively especially we were all over the place.\n\"You have to do the old-fashioned defensive things well and we didn't. My players were well-briefed on the opposition and you just have to hope they take that into the game.\n\"We made the same mistakes time and time again; missed headers, missed bouncing balls, the same stuff. The players have to take responsibility as well as me, and that was dire, as bad as anything I have been involved in here. I can't walk into the dressing room and say \"Yeah, that was great lads.\" It wasn't.\n\"We have to stick together, but today defensively we were poor. We threatened at times going forward but we couldn't defend. You can ask me questions about myself and my future, that's fine. We're in the bottom three, I know that.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams have tough challenges in their next matches.\nBurnley play at Manchester City and Sunderland host Liverpool, with both matches kicking off at 15:00 GMT on Monday, 2 January.\nSunderland will be without defender Billy Jones after he picked up his fifth booking of the season following a rash sliding tackle on Stephen Ward."

Boss Claudio Ranieri will want more like this from the Algeria winger, but his Boxing Day rest may yet prove a blessing in disguise.\nHammers pay for sluggish start\nWest Ham had 25 shots, yet failed to score in a Premier League game for the first time since 30 October.\nThey were made to pay for their poor start, and Leicester should have been 2-0 up before Slimani's goal.\nManager Slaven Bilic should not be too alarmed, but one defeat could quickly turn into two if they are not firing on all cylinders against Manchester United on Monday.\nThis was a game punctured by countless fouls and eight yellow cards.\nBoth teams could have been reduced to 10 men - Daniel Amartey cut short Mark Noble's afternoon with a nasty tackle, while Havard Nordtveit was fortunate not to see red after a ridiculously high challenge on Chilwell.\nMan of the match - Marc Albrighton (Leicester)\n'Grit, determination, everything'\nLeicester City boss Claudio Ranieri: \"I am very proud because we made a clean sheet - finally.\n\"The result is very good for everybody here in Leicester, and of course it is very good for the team.\n\"We needed the crowd's support, and when I called them they were together with us. The support of our fans is very important.\"\nLeicester City midfielder Marc Albrighton: \"Grit, determination, everything - we showed it in abundance and we need to build on this result in the new year.\n\"It's no secret that we're not in a place that we want to be at the moment, but the performance was tremendous.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"They started better and deserved to score but after that we were really good. We were just missing that final touch.\n\"We gave everything so it is a shame and a frustration, but we played good.\"\nSlimani looking the part - stats\nIslam Slimani has been involved in four of Leicester's past six league goals at the King Power Stadium (two goals, two assists).\nSlimani has scored 15 of his 33 league goals since the start of last season from headers.\nLeicester won 12 Premier League home games in 2016, a record bettered only by Manchester United (13).\nWest Ham failed to score in a league game for the first time since October (against Everton), having netted in eight consecutive games beforehand.\nThe Hammers kept just two clean sheets from 19 away games in the Premier League in 2016.\nWhat's next?\nIt's a quick turnaround for both clubs as they return to action on Monday. While Leicester are at Middlesbrough (12:30 GMT), West Ham get a few extra hours before hosting Manchester United (17:15 GMT).\nMore to follow"

        "article_text": "Chelsea 4-2 Stoke City\nPremier League leaders Chelsea equalled the top-flight record of 13 consecutive wins in a single season by beating valiant Stoke in a thriller at Stamford Bridge.\nAn exceptionally entertaining second half included five goals as the Blues were twice made to retake the lead by a Potters side who gave them one of their toughest tests this season.\nGary Cahill gave Chelsea the lead when he headed in shortly before half-time, but Stoke defender Bruno Martins Indi levelled only a minute after the break when he poked in from close range.\nWillian handed the Blues the advantage again only for Peter Crouch to level with a side-foot effort high past Thibaut Courtois.\nStoke barely had time to celebrate, as moments after the restart Chelsea drove towards goal with Willian applying a fierce, angled finish.\nWith five minutes remaining, the Blues all but sealed the three points when Diego Costa - magnificent as a target-man - shrugged off the attentions of Martins Indi to fire in the fourth.\nChelsea have a six-point lead over second-place Liverpool who defeated Manchester City 1-0 in the late Saturday game.\nRelive the action from Stamford Bridge\nAll the reaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nFootball Daily podcast: Costa 'unplayable' as Chelsea equal record\nChelsea up for the fight\nThis was a brutal test for Antonio Conte's men.\nStoke were organised and disciplined at the back and threatened at the other end. In fact, until Cahill's goal they were the better team and looked more likely to score first.\nTheir spirit was not broken even after Cahill's opener, and seconds after the interval Martins Indi converted his first for the club from Crouch's nod-down.\nChelsea's potent attack compensated for their failings at the back, and 11 minutes later Victor Moses and Hazard combined before Willian poked in.\nBut yet again Stoke, who had not won a league game at Stamford Bridge since 1974, fought back. This time it was Crouch who got on the scoresheet in the league for the first time since May 2015 when he tucked home under pressure.\nHowever, Conte's Chelsea have shown great resolve this season. Just a minute after the second equaliser, Cesc Fabregas found Willian in the area and he rifled in from a tight angle.\nWith five minutes remaining, Costa finally got his reward for an outstanding display with a close-range strike past the reach of goalkeeper Lee Grant.\nStoke threw everything at them and came away with nothing - but they will take some solace that they were playing the best in the league.\nClassy Costa\nThere was a moment late in the second half when 6ft 2in Spain forward Costa was involved in what seemed a minor altercation with a Stoke defender in the opposition area. That 'moment' was swiftly ended by the alert refereeing of Bobby Madley.\nBut would it have become more serious? Because the Costa of this season is very different to the Costa under the old management of ex-Blues boss Jose Mourinho.\nHis Achilles heel was confrontation, but all his aggression appears now to be channelled towards simply outmuscling those who dare to mark him.\nMartins Indi - 6ft 1in and equally stocky - was given that task at Stamford Bridge and did a good job until the 85th minute when, like a rugby forward trying to make a try-saving tackle, he lost his grip of Costa, who punished him with Chelsea's fourth.\nBut it is unlikely Martins Indi will be given such a workout by any other striker for the rest of the season.\nChelsea's lead man has great feet plus pace, channelled aggression and now 14 goals this campaign. A contender for player of the season?\nMan of the match - Diego Costa (Chelsea)\n'Numbers are not important if you do not win the title'\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte:\n\"Congratulations go to my players. To win 13 games in a row in this league is very difficult.\n\"Stoke played very well. They hit long balls to Crouch and fought for the second ball. My players showed they can adapt to the different kinds of game we face. They showed great commitment, work-rate and will to win. I'm delighted for them.\n\"Now, it's important to celebrate the arrival of the new year, then to think of the next game against Tottenham.\n\"Numbers are not important if you do not win the title. Now, they are fantastic and we are proud, but we must concentrate on the second part of the season.\"\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes:\n\"It's a similar story to our efforts at Liverpool. We got back level, but then conceded poor goals. We've made mistakes and good teams punish you.\n\"I thought we did really well, showing courage to get back in the game. I thought we were good value to get a draw, but we can't keep on making the mistakes we are at the moment because it's hurting us.\n\"We were positive, got back level and it was up for grabs. For their third goal, the ball went through about four of our players. We can't keep defending as we are in key moments. If we take that out of our game, we will be fine.\n\"Mistakes happen, the opposition can affect what you do. You have to understand the time, the moments of the game.\"\nStats you need to know\nChelsea are just the second Premier League team in history to win 13 consecutive games in a single season, following Arsenal in 2001-02.\nFabregas registered his 100th Premier League assist - the fourth player to achieve this feat (Ryan Giggs - 162, Frank Lampard - 102, Wayne Rooney - 101).\nFabregas was the quickest player to reach 100 Premier League assists, however (293 apps).\nIt's the first time Fabregas has assisted in back-to-back Premier League games since January 2015.\nCosta has had a hand in 19 Premier League goals (14 goals, five assists) this season. In only three games has he failed to either score or assist a goal.\nCrouch scored his first Premier League goal since May 2015 v Liverpool - 587 days ago.\nMartins Indi netted his first Premier League goal just 55 seconds into the second half. It was the quickest Stoke had scored in the second half since April 2013 (Charlie Adam v Norwich, 45:51).\nWhat's next?\nThe Blues face a tough test at Spurs on Wednesday, 4 January (20:00 GMT) and Stoke are at home to Watford (20:00 GMT) a day earlier."

There's no excuse for the second goal. Winston Reid gets above the two defenders - there's no way he should win the ball - but he gets above them because he wants it more, it means more to him.\n\"It was a big punt bringing Bob Bradley in, with his lack of experience of Premier League players and lack of experience in the Premier League. It was always going to be a big ask of him to keep Swansea up.\"\nFormer West Ham forward Ian Wright:\n\"It was starting to get tight for West Ham and Slaven Bilic had to dig the players out after the 5-1 defeat to Arsenal at the start of December. The players needed to hear that.\"\nMan of the match - Andy Carroll (West Ham)\nSwansea's shaky defence\nSwansea have shipped 29 goals in the top flight since Bob Bradley took charge on 15 October, more than any other side.\nSwansea have conceded the first goal in 13 Premier League games this season, only Hull have done so more often.\nWest Ham have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March.\nAndre Ayew is the 41st player to score both for and against West Ham in the Premier League, more than any other club has seen.\nDimitri Payet has provided 15 Premier League assists in 2016, more than any other player.\nWhat next?\nSwansea host Bournemouth on New Year's Eve before taking on Crystal Palace on 3 January. West Ham travel to Leicester on 31 December and face Manchester United at home on 2 January."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 1-0 Manchester City\nLiverpool maintained their pursuit of Premier League leaders Chelsea as they moved to within six points of the pacesetters with victory over Manchester City at Anfield.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum's soaring eighth-minute header from Adam Lallana's cross was enough to put Liverpool in second place and put a serious dent in City's own title challenge.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp led the celebrations at the end of a game that was high on energy but sadly lacking in any moments of genuine quality.\nCity, who laboured throughout, improved in the second half but never seriously threatened Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and this loss leaves them 10 points adrift of Chelsea.\nKlopp gets better of Pep\nThis was the first Premier League meeting between two huge personalities straight from the top tier of management - and it brought a victory for Jurgen Klopp to cherish at Pep Guardiola's expense.\nThe head-to-head was locked at 4-4 after their meetings in Germany with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. This was a different stage with different prizes on offer - but it was an occasion that was just as charged.\nKlopp, in 15 months, has revitalised Liverpool and given hope to supporters longing to end the wait for a first title since 1990. And as they continue their pursuit of relentless Chelsea, belief continues to grow that the charismatic German can still haul in Antonio Conte's side.\nLiverpool's manager was, as usual, celebrating with his players after the final whistle before pumping his chest in mock relief in front of Anfield's huge new Main Stand.\nAnd, when City fleetingly threatened a second-half comeback, he turned cheerleader in front of those same fans with a demand to lift the noise levels that was met instantly.\nKlopp has become the new Anfield talisman. Under him, the transformation of his team and the mood around the club continues.\nSomething else that will give Liverpool's fans great heart is the way in which Klopp is getting results against his closest rivals.\nSince his appointment in October 2015, Klopp has faced a total of 13 Premier League games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. He has lost only one - a single goal defeat by United last season.\nHe has also enjoyed a Europa League win over two legs against United, although the balance is redressed slightly by a loss on penalties against Manchester City in last season's Capital One Cup final.\nCan Liverpool win the Premier League?\nLiverpool - and indeed Manchester City - are having to run to stand still in the Premier League title race, with Chelsea stretching their winning run to 13 games as they beat Stoke City earlier on Saturday.\nIt meant this was a game both sides needed to win - hence the contrasting emotions of Klopp and Guardiola at the final whistle.\nLiverpool are underdogs but six points is still a gap that can be closed and Chelsea have to visit Anfield on 31 January.\nKlopp's players have shown strength of character with their response to setbacks earlier this month, when they lost 4-3 at Bournemouth and drew 2-2 at home to West Ham.\nThey have also shown they can win in different ways. Recent victories over Middlesbrough and Stoke showcased a free-flowing style. At Everton and against City, they toughed it out - and answered questions about a supposedly vulnerable defence. It is evidence that Liverpool must be taken very seriously as title challengers.\nAre City's title hopes over?\nIt is far too early to dismiss a manager of Guardiola's ability - and a team of City's talents - in terms of the Premier League title race. However, the 10-point gap between themselves and Chelsea is starting to look as if it will only be overturned by extraordinary events.\nCity were too timid for too long here at Anfield. Sergio Aguero - returning after a four-match ban - was starved of service, while Kevin de Bruyne was marginalised and largely snuffed out by Liverpool's intense pressing style.\nIt was still David Silva who called the shots when they did put some moves together after the break but Yaya Toure could not exert serious influence.\nGuardiola's task should at least be put in context. City were a team short on inspiration and spark for much of last season under Manuel Pellegrini. Perhaps it was too much to expect even a manager of Guardiola's pedigree to apply an instant fix.\nCity should never be ruled out. But on the evidence of this flat performance - and the growing sense that significant renewal of the squad is still needed - dragging back Chelsea may be beyond them for this season.\nMan of the match - Georginio Wijnaldum\n'I don't care about criticism' - what they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I know everyone talks about our defence. It's not about avoiding goals - that's the end product - it's about how we work together.\n\"I think we have the smallest number of shots on our goal in the league. Tonight the concentration level was outstanding.\n\"I don't care about criticism of our defence. You always pick out things that aren't right but that's how goals are.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It was an equal game. The goal made it difficult against a team who use the counter-attack like a master. The second half was much better.\n\"We have to wake up for another game. We need to focus and work - we can't think about the big goals.\"\nMatch of the Day analysis\nFormer England defender Phil Neville: \"It was a poor game. I was so disappointed by how poorly Manchester City passed the ball. They didn't get back into shape quick enough.\n\"Aleksandar Kolarov should have been winning that header against Georginio Wijnaldum. They were really poor in possession and well off the pace. Full credit to Liverpool, they set up deeper and didn't let City have possession.\"\nReds rule - the stats\nLiverpool have won four consecutive league games against Manchester City for the first time since 1981 (when they managed a run of seven).\nPep Guardiola has now suffered twice as many league defeats this season (four) as he did in the entire 2015-16 Bundesliga campaign with Bayern Munich (two).\nManchester City have kept just four clean sheets in their 19 Premier League games under Guardiola.\nLiverpool have scored 87 league goals in 2016; their most in a calendar year since 1985 (also 87).\nAdam Lallana has made seven assists in the Premier League this season (in 17 appearances); his most in a single campaign.\nLallana also ends 2016 having been involved in 21 goals in the Premier League (11 goals, 10 assists); no midfielder in the competition has had a hand in more.\nWhat's next?\nA swift turnaround. City host Burnley at 15:00 GMT on Monday, while at the same time Liverpool are at struggling Sunderland."

He and Troy Deeney have contributed 10 goals between them this season, 14 fewer than at the same stage in 2015-16.\nThe Hornets next face Stoke and Middlesbrough. Their fans could be looking over their shoulders at the bottom three by mid-January, unless they can find some form.\nKane loves New Year's Day - stats\nNo player has been involved in more Premier League goals on New Year's Day than Harry Kane's six ( four goals and two assists) - level with Andrew Cole and Steven Gerrard (both five goals and one assist)\nSpurs were three goals up at half-time for the first time in a Premier League away game since March 1997 v Sunderland\nThis was the first time the Hornets had let in four goals in a Premier League game at Vicarage Road\nWatford have never beaten Tottenham in a Premier League match, drawing twice and losing five\n'One of the best this season' - manager quotes\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"Zuniga was the 10th player to get injured, five or six are starting 11, we had four under-23s in the 18 players that we brought today. Unfortunately this is the situation.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We played very good, to a very high standard. The first half was one of the best we've played this season. I'm very happy because it was a difficult game, and the team responded.\"\nMan of the match - Harry Kane\nWhat next?\nTottenham will try to end Chelsea's 13-game winning streak when they host Antonio Conte's side in a 20:00 GMT kick-off on Wednesday. Watford have a day less to recover as they travel to Stoke for a 20:00 GMT kick-off on Tuesday."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-0 Crystal Palace\nOlivier Giroud's incredible scorpion kick set Arsenal on the way to a victory over Crystal Palace which moved them up to third in the Premier League.\nWith a cross from Alexis Sanchez delivered behind him, Frenchman Giroud elastically reached the ball with his left foot, looping it over his head and in off the underside of the bar.\nAn Alex Iwobi header gave Arsenal a scrappy second before Palace briefly rallied to force saves from home goalkeeper Petr Cech.\nThe win moves the Gunners back to within nine points of leaders Chelsea, while Palace stay 17th, two points above the relegation zone.\nThe visitors have won only once in 13 league games, with manager Sam Allardyce awaiting his first victory since taking over from Alan Pardew.\nGiroud's magnificent moment of magic\nGiroud marked his return to the Arsenal starting line-up on Boxing Day by scoring the only goal in the win over West Bromwich Albion, and followed up here by pulling off one of the most memorable moments of this or any other season.\nIndeed, it was made all the more remarkable for its echoes of a similarly breathtaking goal scored by Manchester United's Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the defeat of Sunderland on Monday.\nIf anything, Giroud's was even more impressive, an acrobatic finish to a head-high cross delivered from the left by Sanchez at the end of a pacy Arsenal counter-attack.\nAs the ball arrived, a sprinting Giroud turned to stick out his left foot, flicked the ball over his head and saw it arc over the leap of Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, off the woodwork and into the net.\n\"It was an unbelievable finish,\" said former Arsenal defender Martin Keown on BBC Radio 5 live. \"It has to be up there with the goal of the season already.\n\"He's hooked that with a gadget foot - the ball is behind him and he has no right to get his foot to it.\"\n'The best goal I've scored' - what they said\nOlivier Giroud told BBC Sport: \"It is not difficult to say it is the best one. I was a bit lucky but it was the only thing I could do, the ball was behind me and I tried to hit it with a backheel.\n\"Maybe Henrikh Mkhitaryan's goal inspired me, it's the only thing you can do in that position. It is nice for me and the team because we start the year with a win.\"\nCrystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey on Sky Sports: \"It was a wonder goal - there seems to be a lot going in recently. It's a fantastic strike.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a great counter-attack at great speed, his reflex surprised everybody who knows football and that's what makes the goal great.\n\"I have been a bit spoiled over the years by the exceptional quality of the players I've had, but it will be remembered as an exceptional goal.\n\"Olly is very good in front of goal, but I've never seen this kind of goal from him.\"\nArsenal back on track\nArsenal lost ground in the title race with defeats by Everton and Manchester City, and began this game in fifth place following Tottenham's win at Watford.\nGiroud's goal was the highlight of an otherwise lacklustre first half in which the only other moment of note was the Frenchman missing his kick attempting to meet a cross inside the six-yard box.\nStill, the Gunners' threat was always apparent, particularly in the shape of the forward running of full-backs Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal, who tormented the Palace defence throughout.\nMonreal was involved in the second goal, providing a cross that was not dealt with, Iwobi heading in despite the efforts of Palace defender Joel Ward on the line.\nAny encouragement for Allardyce?\nPalace had the chance to win Allardyce's first match in charge, only for Christian Benteke to have a penalty saved in the 1-1 draw with Watford.\nAt Arsenal, a team Allardyce has never beaten away in 13 Premier League attempts, what he already knew was reinforced - his new team are a threat going forward but need to improve at the back.\nThe 35 goals Palace have conceded is the most by any team outside the relegation zone. Though they were often organised, an inability to deal with Arsenal's movement ensured Hennessey was kept busy and the defending for the home side's second goal was shambolic.\nAfter that, Palace had their best spell of pressure. Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend provided the drive, with Townsend, Benteke and Yohan Cabaye all calling Cech into action.\nThere is plenty to suggest Palace can move clear of trouble if Allardyce can add his trademark tightness to their backline.\n\"Our season won't be defined by results against the top six,\" he said. \"What we do when we play the teams in the bottom half of the league will be the defining reason of whether or not we get out of the bottom half.\n\"I have every confidence in the players that it will turn around and hopefully as quick as possible.\"\nMan of the match - Olivier Giroud\nOlivier's reward - the stats\nOlivier Giroud has scored eight goals in his past six starts for Arsenal in all competitions.\nSam Allardyce has never won at Arsenal as a manager in all competitions, drawing four and losing 12 of his 16 visits.\nSince joining the club, Alexis Sanchez has had a hand in 88 goals for Arsenal in all competitions (56 goals, 32 assists) - 26 more than any other Gunner.\nArsenal have won 130 of their 200 Premier League games at the Emirates under Arsene Wenger (65%) - they won 72% of their league games at Highbury under the Frenchman (134/186).\nThe Gunners have kept consecutive Premier League clean sheets at home for the first time this season, last doing so in their final three games of 2015-16.\nCrystal Palace have failed to keep a clean sheet in their past 20 Premier League away games, since a 0-0 draw at Bournemouth in December 2015.\nAllardyce has failed to win either of his first two Premier League games in charge of a club for the first time in his career.\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are in action on Tuesday. Arsenal make the trip to Bournemouth (19:45 GMT), while Palace host bottom club Swansea (20:00)."

        "article_text": "Middlesbrough 0-0 Leicester City\nMiddlesbrough and Leicester played out a dull goalless draw at the Riverside to boost their respective effort to pull clear of the bottom three.\nIn a game bereft of clear-cut chances, there were just four efforts on target throughout the whole 90 minutes.\nMiddlesbrough wanted a penalty when Robert Huth brought down Adama Traore and Boro's Gaston Ramirez lashed the best opportunity wide from six yards.\nLeicester, without a Premier League away win this season compared to 11 in last term's title-winning campaign, saw Leonardo Ulloa head a corner straight at Brad Guzan.\nBoro move four points clear of the drop zone, while Leicester have a six-point cushion.\nWas it a penalty? Huth thinks so\nPossibly the most interesting event at the Riverside came after the game, when Huth admitted he should have conceded a penalty.\nThe German defender tried to get out of the way as Traore wormed his way into the area in the first half, and even though he made contact with the Boro winger, referee Bobby Madley waved away the appeals.\n\"We got lucky,\" Huth told Sky Sports.\nEx-Chelsea winger Pat Nevin, watching the game for BBC Radio 5 live, disagreed with Huth, saying: \"There is nothing you can do as a defender. There is contact, but contact does not mean a penalty kick.\"\nBoro on the goal hunt\nThe point for Boro will be a minor consolation after conceding two late goals to lose at Manchester United on Saturday.\nBut it means they come out of the festive period with just one goal - and no wins - from three games.\nOnly Hull City have scored fewer goals than Boro's 17 in the Premier League this season and their lack of creativity against Leicester prevented them turning a draw into a win.\nLeft-back Friend - a first-half substitute for the injured Antonio Barragan - was often their most dangerous attacking outlet as he provided a number of dangerous crosses his team-mates failed to capitalise on.\nFoxes prepare for life without Mahrez\nLeicester's 1-0 win over West Ham at the weekend meant they were under less pressure to pick up all the points at the Riverside.\nBut they will now be without influential playmaker Riyad Mahrez potentially until early February, as he leaves to join the Algeria squad for the Africa Cup of Nations.\nMahrez has not been at his best this season though, and in the victory over West Ham it was the combination of Marc Albrighton and Islam Slimani that proved to be the Foxes' most potent weapon.\nBut with Slimani missing out with a fever - and himself primed for Algeria duty - and Albrighton on the bench, it is a struggle to see where Leicester's attacking thrust will come from over the next few weeks.\nPerhaps from Jamie Vardy, who will return from a three-match suspension to face Everton in the FA Cup on Saturday.\nMan of the match - George Friend\n'We were looking for a point' - Manager reaction\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"I am pleased with the players because it's two days after the tough defeat on Saturday against Manchester United.\n\"We played against a team who won the league last season and are in the Champions League - but we were better than them.\n\"I am happy with the performance but we could not score the goal.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: \"I am pleased with the point because we came here looking for a minimum of one point.\n\"We defended well and showed good spirit. We wanted to do more but it was difficult because they closed down our actions well. It is an important point to start 2017 with.\n\"We were not lucky today. I am very, very happy.\"\nWorst performance by a defending champion - match stats\nLeicester have collected just 21 points from their opening 20 Premier League games, the worst return by a reigning champion\nWes Morgan has played each of Leicester's last 81 Premier League games, the longest current run by a player in the top flight\nMiddlesbrough are winless in their last 14 league games against Leicester (D8 L6), their longest current winless streak against any team\nMiddlesbrough keeper Brad Guzan has kept consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since January 2015\nWhat's next?\nIt's FA Cup third-round weekend coming up, so Leicester travel to Everton on Saturday in an all-Premier League tie, while Middlesbrough host Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday."

        "article_text": "Everton 3-0 Southampton\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman enjoyed a win over former club Southampton thanks to goals from Enner Valencia, Leighton Baines and Romelu Lukaku.\nThe match had lacked quality and chances until substitute Valencia scored his first goal for the club, driving in a shot from close range after Lukaku's header had been saved.\nValencia was also involved in the second goal as he won a penalty when he was fouled by Maya Yoshida.\nBaines stepped up to score calmly from the spot before Lukaku latched on to a Tom Davies pass and smashed a shot into the top corner.\nEverton stay seventh and moved six points clear of 10th-placed Southampton, who lost a third Premier League game in succession - their worst run since December 2014 when they lost four in a row.\nRelive Everton v Southampton as it happened\nFollow reaction to Monday's games\nValencia makes key contribution\nThis match was drifting towards goalless obscurity before the introduction of Valencia as a 61st-minute substitute.\nThe forward added an extra attacking dimension to Everton's play as his pace combined with the support of Lukaku, who helped set up the opener.\nLukaku spread the ball wide to Seamus Coleman and got on the end of the right-back's cross to send in a header which keeper Fraser Forster saved with his boot before Valencia converted the rebound.\nAfter Valencia also had a hand in the second, Lukaku was rewarded for his tireless display with his 11th goal of the season.\nThe Belgium forward's goal was created by Davies - and the 18-year-old midfielder's display will be another bonus for Koeman, with Idrissa Gueye set to be absent as he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal.\nHectic schedule tires Southampton\nSouthampton were playing their third match in six days - compared with Everton's same number of outings in eight days - and they wilted after conceding the first goal.\nUp until that moment, there had not been much between the sides and, had forward Nathan Redmond been more clinical, they could have taken the lead.\nRedmond was in on goal after a clipped pass by Jay Rodriguez but, despite getting plenty of power on his shot, sent it too close to keeper Joel Robles, who beat the effort away.\n\"It is unfair,\" said Saints boss Claude Puel, whose side came into the game on the back of defeats by Tottenham and West Brom. \"It was a balanced game but the first goal was difficult to accept. Players were tired.\n\"They played two days ago and it was difficult to finish this game but the spirit and the attitude of the team was good.\"\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku\nWhat they said:\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"The tempo was higher in the second half, we created opportunities to score and you see the final result.\n\"When Enner Valencia came in it was not just about his goal, it was his whole performance - we needed that pace in the second half.\n\"Keeping a clean sheet is always important. We did well defensively.\n\"I am busy with all the fixtures we have and maybe the board will be busy to bring the players in.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"I am sorry for the players because they did good work and it is a shame to concede three goals in this game. For the moment we are unlucky.\"\nMatch of the Day pundit Martin Keown: \"Ross Barkley was running the show. He can shoot with either foot but he has tidied up his game. He keep things simple and has plenty in his brain. He is now dictating the play and making things tick. The manager has done that for him.\"\nLukaku trails only Aguero and Kane\nEverton are unbeaten in their last 12 home Premier League games against Southampton (W9 D3), conceding just six goals in that time.\nLeighton Baines became the third defender to score 30 Premier League goals after John Terry (40) and David Unsworth (38).\nThe Toffees have scored at least two goals in five of their last six Premier League games, failing to score in the other (0-1 vs Liverpool).\nSince Romelu Lukaku's debut for Everton in September 2013, only Sergio Aguero (77) and Harry Kane (59) have scored more Premier League goals than him (54).\nRonald Koeman became the first manager to field two teenagers in a Premier League game (Calvert-Lewin, 19 and Davies, 18) since Louis van Gaal for Manchester United against Bournemouth in May (Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Marcus Rashford).\nWhat next?\nEverton host Leicester City and Southampton travel to Norwich as both sides are in FA Cup action on Saturday, 7 January at 15:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Burnley\nTen-man Manchester City moved up to third as they withstood a spirited Burnley fightback in front of a relieved Etihad Stadium.\nFernandinho was dismissed towards the end of an even first half for a two-footed challenge on Johan Gudmundsson.\nBut the hosts improved after the break as Gael Clichy squeezed home a shot before Sergio Aguero, on as a substitute, fired home from a tight angle.\nBen Mee smashed home via the underside of the bar shortly after but Burnley could not force a leveller despite a fine chance for Andre Gray late on.\nCity take the hard road\nBeginning the day 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, anything less than victory would have prompted some to begin reading the last rites on City's title challenge.\nAs it is, Pep Guardiola's side will look at the league table with renewed optimism as they closed to within two points of second-place Liverpool with one and possibly both of Chelsea and Tottenham to drop points when they face each other on Wednesday.\nHowever, Fernandinho's dismissal meant they had to fight harder than they might have expected for victory.\nThe City captain took some of the ball as he contested a 50:50 ball in midfield, but his reckless scissor-action style meant that referee Lee Mason's decision to show red could be easily justified.\nIt is not the first time City's discipline has hindered their title ambitions. Including Sergio Aguero's retrospective red against West Ham, they have been shown seven red cards in Guardiola's 30 games in charge.\nFernandinho's third red card in six games for City means he will be banned for four matches and not available again until 5 February.\nShould Fernandinho have been sent off? MOTD analysis\nFormer Republic of Ireland midfielder Kevin Kilbane: \"There's no doubt it is a red for Fernandinho. It is quite clear. He's reckless and out of control. Referee Lee Mason is in a good position. It is a bad one. You see those sort of challenges and you hope for the best for the opposing player.\"\nEx-Arsenal defender Martin Keown: \"It is a 100% red card all day long. His third in six games. It is indefensible, you don't want to see that in the game.\"\nAguero off the bench and to the rescue\nWell before Fenandinho's lunging challenge, Guardiola's team selection seemed to have hampered rather than helped City's cause.\nAguero, who was spared the rigours of the festive fixture list after only making his comeback from a four-match ban in the New Year's Eve defeat by Liverpool, was left on the bench with Kelechi Iheanacho preferred up front.\nIheanacho missed the best of what little City created in the first half and Aguero brought a more threatening edge to the hosts' attack when he was introduced alongside David Silva at half-time.\nThe Argentine's dead-eyed finish from a tight angle, past two covering defenders, provided the winner and convincing evidence for an immediate recall.\nBurnley come close on return to Manchester\nBurnley have only won a single point away from Turf Moor this season, but they can count themselves unlucky not to follow their October draw at Old Trafford with similar on their return to Manchester.\nWhile they confounded United with a stubborn rearguard action, Sean Dyche's side went toe-to-toe with City even before Fernandinho's red card gave them an extra man.\nMee's goal, awarded with help by the decision review system, exposed goalkeeper Claudio Bravo's uncertainty in the air, but Burnley created enough to take a point without City's errors.\nThe precision that Gray showed in scoring his hat-trick against Middlesbrough last time out deserted him in injury-time while Sam Vokes glanced just wide when well placed.\nThe Clarets remain 11th, eight points above the drop and well above par for the season so far.\nWhy always Fernandinho? - Stats\nFernandinho is the first City player to see two reds in a Premier League season since Mario Balotelli in 2011-12.\nRaheem Sterling has been directly involved in nine Premier League goals for City this season (5 goals, 4 assists), compared to eight in his first season at the club.\nGael Clichy scored just his third Premier League goal in 311 games (two for City, one for Arsenal). His last goal came in November 2014 v Southampton.\nCity have only kept a clean sheet in two of their 10 Premier League games at the Etihad this season.\nBurnley's goal was only the third they have managed away from home this season.\nThe Clarets have still taken just one point from their away games this season, with 22 of their total of 23 coming at Turf Moor (drawing one and losing eight away).\n\"I'm so happy, believe me\" - manager quotes\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola gave a series of short answers to BBC Sport's Damian Johnson after the match, a selection of which appears below:\nDamian Johnson: \"What was your view of the red card for Fernandinho?\"\nPep Guardiola: \"You are the journalist. Not me.\"\nDJ: \"You're the manager. I'm sure the fans would like to know.\nPG: \"Ask the referee - not me.\"\nDJ: \"You don't seem that happy that you've won.\"\nPG: \"More than you would believe. More than you would believe I am happy.\"\nDJ: \"You're not showing it.\"\nPG: \"I'm so happy believe me. I'm so happy. Happy new year.\"\nDJ: \"Are Manchester City in the title race?\"\nPG: \"Yesterday no. Why today are we in the title race?\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We gave away two poor goals, but the two players that they brought on at half-time are not bad players. I thought that they had an effect.\n\"It is a missed opportunity. We lost our way a bit when they went down to 10 men. They came out really hard and fast after half-time. We made a game of it after that. There was no lack of effort, but we could not find a way through.\nOn Fernandinho's red card: \"It was a red by modern standards. In years gone by, maybe not, but today I think it is.\"\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to West Ham in the third round of the FA Cup on Friday with Burnley taking on Sunderland the next day in the same competition."

The \u00a35.5m summer signing is looking a shrewd investment.\nSuch business should stand Pulis in good stead when it comes to strengthening in January and ahead of kick-off, chairman John Williams said the club will do everything it can to acquire \"immediate first-team selections\".\n, external\nHis new year message cited concerns over falling home crowds. The home contingent among the 23,402 in place at the Hawthorns left with little to grumble about.\n'I can't defend the corners'\nMike Phelan's demeanour in his post-match interview was that of a man helpless to his side's failings.\n\"I can't defend the corners and my staff can't defend the corners,\" he told BBC Sport, adding his team did not \"carry out the basics\".\nHull have now conceded 24 goals in 10 away games this season and are 22 matches without a clean sheet - equalling a club record set in 1991 and 1936.\nA defeat after such early promise will no doubt hurt badly and it is hard to see where Phelan's side will find the clean sheets that will give them any chance of survival.\nThe future of Snodgrass is also a concern. He said this week that he has not agreed a new deal and the club have activated a short-term extension of his contract.\n, external\nThe Scot has been involved in nine of Hull's 17 goals - scoring seven and creating two.\nHe must be kept and some January defensive signings also seem critical to bolster their fading survival hopes.\nMan of the match - James Morrison\n'New signings sought' - what the manager's said\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We changed things around 30 minutes into the first half. Their shape was more potent than ours. As soon as we did that we got into the game more. After that they didn't create a lot and it's another great three points for us.\n\"We are delighted to be on 29 points, it's been a good year for us. Now we need to bring a couple in to improve the group and give everyone a lift again.\"\nHull City manager Mike Phelan: \"Everyone has a man and marker. If you switch off you get punished when you're in a dominant situation. We played an excellent first half but within five minutes the game was changed.\n\"It shouldn't happen. We should be a lot more disciplined and focused. You have to do the dirty bits at times. Taking responsibility, marking your men and seeing it through. If you are not going to do that you are going to suffer.\"\nBaggies use their head - the stats...\nWest Brom have netted three or more goals in five different home league games this season, more than in any previous Premier League campaign.\nHull have lost each of their last eight Premier League away games, the worst such run since Newcastle lost nine in a row up to April 2016.\nCourtesy of Brunt's goal, the Baggies became the first side to hit double figures for headed goals in the Premier League this season (10, rising to 11 via McAuley's goal).\nUp next?\nWest Brom - who will lose Allan Nyom to the Africa Cup of Nations - have an FA Cup third round home tie against Derby on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nHull - who will now be without Ahmed Elmohamady and Dieumerci Mbokani due to the tournament in Gabon - host fellow league strugglers Swansea City in the same competition at the same time."

His team battled hard, gave everything, defended deep in numbers and showed their fighting spirit when Liverpool looked like they might run away with the match.\nSunderland remain in the bottom three, but Moyes will be encouraged by the point as the Black Cats look to extend their 10-year Premier League stay.\nHowever, like Klopp, Moyes faces a battle to juggle his squad. Sunderland's lengthy injury list includes first-choice goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, defender Lamine Kone, midfielders Lee Cattermole and Steven Pienaar and strikers Duncan Watmore and Victor Anichebe.\nMidfielders Didier Ndong (Gabon) and Wahbi Khazri (Tunisia) are also set to play at the Africa Cup of Nations in January to provide further problems for Moyes.\nMan of the match - Vito Mannone (Sunderland)\nStats - Rodwell's unwanted record continues\nLiverpool have now lost just one of their past 18 Premier League games (won 12).\nMoyes has only one victory from his past 17 Premier League games as a manager against Liverpool (10 defeats).\nJack Rodwell made his 34th start for Sunderland but is yet to be on the winning side (16 draws and 18 losses); extending the Premier League record.\nDefoe is the fourth player to score 10 or more goals in 10 different Premier League seasons, along with Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard.\nSunderland are the first team to score two penalties in a Premier League game against Liverpool since West Brom in April 2011.\nSturridge has scored in consecutive Premier League games after a run of 12 appearances without a goal.\nMane has had a hand in five goals in his past seven Premier League appearances (three goals, two assists).\nWhat they said\nSunderland manager Moyes said: \"I expect them to get results, but I'm really pleased after the few days we've had. We didn't play well (against Burnley) and what they have done is show how well they can do.\n\"I thought we did quite well, matched Liverpool's energy for long periods of the game and deserved a draw. We had big chances as well.\n\"I never thought we were out of it. The important thing was to not concede a third goal. In the end we got a deserved penalty.\n\"Towards the end of the season we are going to have to pick up a lot of results. Today was a tough draw and we have to make sure we win at home - that's key.\"\nLiverpool boss Klopp said: \"I am not able to explain it because I don't know exactly what I saw. My team were fighting but I wasn't sure if they could do it.\n\"We can play better but I'm not sure if you can play better with that (two-day) break.\"\nOn Sunderland's second penalty, the German added: \"There was no foul before the free-kick for the second penalty. You need a little bit of luck, but Sunderland worked hard too and maybe they deserved it.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are next in action in the third round of the FA Cup. Sunderland entertain fellow Premier League side Burnley on Saturday (15:00), one week after losing 4-1 to the Clarets in an away league match.\nLiverpool take on League Two high-flyers Plymouth Argyle on 8 January (13:30), before playing at Southampton on 11 January in the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final (19:45).\nSunderland next play in the Premier League on 14 January with a home game against Stoke (15:00), with Liverpool away at Manchester United at 16:00 the following day."

It was a brilliant save by Darren Randolph to deny him from close range, but the Ecuador international should have buried the chance, as should Jesse Lingard, who hit the post with the follow-up.\nMourinho's decisions to bring on Mata at the start of the second half and Rashford before the hour mark proved decisive.\nThe pair combined to break West Ham's spirited resistance - the busy and menacing Rashford evading a couple of challenges before cutting back for Spaniard Mata to find the net.\nThe 19-year-old England striker hit the post before Ibrahimovic, standing in an offside position, scored a controversial second to complete West Ham's misery.\nPositives in defeat for Hammers\nBeaten by Leicester City on Saturday, it has been a 48 hours to forget for West Ham in terms of results.\nHowever, they dug deep, displayed a steely resolve - and might even have got something from the game despite the visitors' extra-man advantage.\nDavid de Gea twice saved well from Manuel Lanzini, before Michail Antonio's glancing header flashed agonisingly wide as the Hammers threatened.\nAnd shortly before Mata broke the deadlock, Antonio found himself clean through after Lanzini's perfectly weighted pass, only for De Gea to block his effort.\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\n'We are champions of bad decisions'\nWest Ham boss Bilic: \"I was pleased with the performance, we fought hard and gave everything. I told my players that if we did this we will be all right in the table.\n\"Ten men against a team like this is very hard - but we had chances.\n\"I am disappointed with the result and frustrated by how we lost it, but I am proud of my players.\"\nManchester United manager Mourinho: \"It was hard for us to think well with one more man - and it was very hard for them physically.\n\"I was happy with my choices in Juan Mata and Marcus Rashford, they gave us what we needed. Rashford is very professional and very mature. He is a Manchester United player with Manchester United DNA.\n\"I don't feel sorry for West Ham - I didn't watch the decisions. I think if you talk about decisions, we are the champions of bad decisions.\"\nStats - Mourinho's longest winning run since 2014\nManchester United are now 13 games unbeaten in all competitions - longest run since March 2013 (18 games).\nIbrahimovic has already scored more goals in all competitions than Manchester United's top scorer last season (Martial, 17).\nThis is Mourinho's longest winning run in all competitions (seven) since January 2014 when in charge of Chelsea.\nWest Ham have lost consecutive Premier League games without scoring for the first time under Bilic.\nSince the start of last season, no team has been shown more Premier League red cards than the Hammers (eight - level with Southampton).\nMata has been involved in 40 Premier League goals (25 goals, 15 assists) since his Manchester United debut. Only Wayne Rooney with 46 - 29 goals and 17 assists - has a better record in that time.\nDean has shown 14 red cards in the Premier League since the start of last season - at least six more than any other referee.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham are back in action on Friday when they host fellow Premier League side Manchester City in the FA Cup third round (19:55 GMT kick-off).\nManchester United start their defence of the famous trophy at home against Championship club Reading - managed by former Old Trafford defender Jaap Stam - on Saturday (12:30)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 3-3 Arsenal\nArsenal completed a dramatic comeback at Bournemouth as they rescued a point in injury time having fallen 3-0 behind.\nThe Gunners looked destined for a third away league defeat in a row before a late rally that began with a diving Alexis Sanchez header and gathered momentum when a stunning Lucas Perez left-footed volley reduced the gap to a single goal.\nBournemouth went down to 10 men when Simon Francis was sent off for a challenge on Aaron Ramsey and Arsenal capitalised as Olivier Giroud headed a 92nd-minute equaliser.\nThe home side had overwhelmed the Gunners early on and taken the lead when Charlie Daniels cut inside Hector Bellerin and stroked a shot past on-rushing keeper Petr Cech.\nCallum Wilson scored a penalty to extend Bournemouth's lead and Ryan Fraser sent a shot through Cech's legs for the Cherries' third before the hour mark.\nBut the hosts buckled under Arsenal's late pressure as Arsene Wenger's side moved eight points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, who play Tottenham on Wednesday.\nRelive Tuesday's football action\nHow the comeback unfolded\nArsenal had produced a feeble display for 70 minutes and were second best in the face of Bournemouth's energy and desire but that all changed when Sanchez headed in at the far post following Giroud's flick-on.\nThe momentum of the match changed and five minutes later Giroud clipped a lovely ball to substitute Perez and he sent an angled volley inside the far post.\nFrancis' sending-off helped Arsenal, although Cherries boss Eddie Howe felt it was a \"harsh\" decision by referee Michael Oliver.\nGiroud headed in from a Granit Xhaka cross as Bournemouth failed in their desperate attempts to hang on during six minutes of added time.\nMixed emotions for Arsenal\nArsenal have been accused of lacking the character to maintain a title challenge in recent seasons and they did little to change that perception before Sanchez's goal.\nThey were continually second best to the home side and frustrations rose to the surface in the first half.\nSanchez and Ramsey exchanged angry words at 2-0 down, while Giroud showed his annoyance when Shkodran Mustafi failed to find him with a pass that went harmlessly out of play.\nThat they regrouped in such thrilling manner was doubtless a relief but not one that entirely satisfied goalscorer Giroud.\n\"I'm pleased to help the team by scoring the equaliser but I'm still disappointed,\" said the Frenchman.\n\"It's nice to come back but the way we played at the end, that made me think we should have done better. At least we came back, showed great mental strength and I will take it.\"\nNarrow miss for Bournemouth\nOn this date in 2009, boss Eddie Howe was taking caretaker charge of his first match at Bournemouth - who were then second from bottom in League Two.\nSuccess with the Dorset side as they won promotion to League One saw Howe lured away by Burnley, before he returned in October 2012 to complete the club's transformation with two more promotions in three seasons.\nIt is a mark of the turnaround he has instigated that he and his side were left bitterly disappointed at failing to avenge their defeat at Emirates Stadium in November.\nThe Cherries' 3-1 defeat at Arsenal was harsh on them and they looked more than capable of making amends for the majority of this game as the Gunners struggled to deal with their attacking 4-4-2 formation.\nEven with the Arsenal comeback under way, Howe's men had a chance to go 4-2 up when Dan Gosling turned superbly in the visitors' area only to shoot well wide of Cech's goal.\nA point keeps the Cherries ninth in the table.\nMan of the match - Olivier Giroud\nWhat they said:\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"At the start we suffered from the quality of Bournemouth. One team had over three days to recover and on top of that we suffered at the back.\n\"It was a physical test but we came back into the game and we showed we are mentally strong. I am happy to play every day but only if our opponent has done the same.\"\nRead more from Wenger here.\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It's a strange one for us. At 3-0 up you hope the game is over but you can't underestimate the quality of Arsenal and as soon as they got the first goal the game changed.\n\"We didn't see the game out in an effective manner from our perspective but you have to praise their resilience.\"\nArsenal paying the penalty\nArsenal came back to draw a Premier League game from three goals down for the first time.\nOnly Hull (nine) have conceded more Premier League penalties than Arsenal this season (six, level with Southampton).\nCharlie Daniels has provided more assists than any other Premier League defender since the start of last season (eight).\nSanchez's goal was Arsenal's first shot on target in the match, in the 70th minute.\nSanchez has now matched his Premier League goal tally from last season (13 in 20 games this season, compared with 13 in 30 games last season).\nWhat next?\nIt's FA Cup third-round action for both these teams in their next outings with Bournemouth at Millwall at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, 7 January and Arsenal at Preston for a 17:30 kick-off on the same day."

Centre-halves Mawson and Fernandez excelled, restricting Palace to only three shots on target.\nA spectacular scissor kick from Zaha from 18 yards out looked to have denied Swansea before Rangel's first goal of the season, in the 88th minute, made it a perfect day for Clement.\nThe result takes Swansea above Hull up to 19th, only one point behind Crystal Palace in 17th.\nWorrying times for Crystal Palace\nThis was Allardyce's first home game in charge of the Eagles and he will be disappointed with his side's efforts against a team that came into the game with one away win in the league all season.\nTo make things worse for Allardyce, he will be without Ivorian goalscorer Zaha and Malian second-half substitute Bakary Sako, who will both now go to the Africa Cup of Nations.\nZaha has scored four goals this season, while Sako made an impact as a second-half substitute, forcing Lukasz Fabianski to tip a free-kick over, and causing the Swansea defence problems with his power.\nPalace will also be hoping that a shoulder injury to top scorer Christian Benteke is not serious after he landed badly following a clash with Fabianski.\nAllardyce was unhappy at two potential penalties that his side were denied - for Fabianski's challenge on Benteke and when Rangel appeared to handle the ball.\nMan of the match - Alfie Mawson (Swansea)\nStats - A good time for a rare Rangel goal\nSwansea ended a run of eight away Premier League games (drew one, lost seven) without a win\nCrystal Palace have now kept only one clean sheet in their last 25 Premier League games.\nAlfie Mawson scored his first Premier League goal for Swansea in his 10th appearance for the club.\nOnly Hull (20) have conceded more goals from set pieces than Crystal Palace (17).\nSince August 2014, only one Premier League midfielder (Sadio Mane - 43) has had a hand in more goals than Gylfi Sigurdsson (42 - 23 goals and 19 assists).\nSam Allardyce has lost his first home Premier League match as a boss for the very first time - he had previously won four and drawn one.\nAngel Rangel ended a run of 95 Premier League matches without a goal by grabbing the winner - it was his first since May 2013 against Wigan.\nWhat they said\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"The lack of energy the players had showed massively. We struggled to keep up with Swansea, we hadn't recovered properly. I should have made more changes but I still don't know the squad too well.\n\"The second half was ours, we saw a wonder goal from Wilfried Zaha that should have got us at least a point, but we switched off and it's massively disappointing.\n\"You can see it with your own eyes, you don't need to be a football manager. Some people say it's rubbish but it's not, the players were trying 100% but they were not physically able to reach their usual levels. They are shattered.\n\"It's beyond our control, certain elements. But we can defend better for the two goals and our first-half performance was nothing like I expect to see from my team.\"\nSwansea first-team coach Alan Curtis: \"It is a terrific result for us and a huge three points. The first-half performance, we were excellent and we could have gone in with more than the one goal.\n\"We have been accused of lacking character but we came back and won it and we deserved it. In training you see the players have the ability, it is just the confidence that has been lacking.\n\"Any team under Sam Allardyce will come on strongly, they have some terrific players. We had 24 hours more rest compared to them and that may have made a difference.\"\nOn the club's new manager Paul Clement, who joined Curtis in the technical area later in the match, he added: \"He came down for some moral support, he made his presence felt at half-time, but there was not too much to say. We would have surprised a lot of people with our performance today.\"\nWhat's next?\nPaul Clement will take charge of a Swansea match for the first time when they play an FA Cup third round tie away at fellow Premier League strugglers Hull City on Saturday, 7 January (15:00 GMT). Crystal Palace are also in cup action at the same time, with an away game at League One side Bolton.\nBoth sides are next in Premier League action at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, 14 January. Palace play at West Ham with Swansea at home to Arsenal."

We got goals at good times and then saw the game out quite comfortably. We didn't really have to deal with too many moments of anxiety.\n\"It's good to get a clean sheet, because we have shipped some poor goals in recent weeks.\"\nOn the prospect of Peter Crouch being offered a new contract: \"Peter has been playing really well and if you put balls in the right areas you know he is going to get on the end of things. I am sure we will get something done - he is playing as well as he ever has done.\"\nWatford head coach Walter Mazzarri: \"We played well, but two episodes, two mistakes, and they managed to score goals. We could have scored before them and we didn't do it, but we demonstrated we can play against a difficult team like Stoke.\n\"We have to keep going and give everything for the next match. Nothing is going our way, so it is just a period we are not lucky but we need to change this. We have many injuries, so it is not a positive period.\"\nHome comforts for Stoke\nStoke have lost just one of their past eight home Premier League games (W4 D3).\nPeter Crouch scored in successive Premier League games for the first time since February 2015.\nWatford have now lost five away Premier League games in a row, conceding 14 goals and scoring just twice.\nRyan Shawcross scored his first Premier League goal since New Year's Day 2015.\nStoke are unbeaten in their past 18 home Premier League matches in which they've scored the first goal.\nWhat next?\nStoke welcome Wolves in the FA Cup third round on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and then travel to Sunderland in the Premier League the following week.\nWatford host Championship side Burton Albion in the cup, before returning to league action at home to Middlesbrough a week on Saturday."

It was a very tough game, we were playing one of the best teams in Europe, so the value of the victory is massive.\n\"It makes us very proud and we showed character and were competitive. It is one step forward for the team and is important to keep going. Football is about belief.\n\"We have shown we can challenge for the big things. We are in a good position, Chelsea is in a very good position, but we are fighting to get points and to reduce the gap above us.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"I saw a game with a great balance. It is not easy to play against Tottenham. But we played with a good personality to create the chances to score a goal, but we could not take them.\n\"It is strange for us to concede these goals because we are defending well, and they are in a crucial moment. At the end of the first half and then in the second half after we miss the chances to score, but this can happen.\n\"We must work hard and be pleased with our position in the table, but know this league is tough until the end for the Champions League, for the title.\"\nSpurs' proud home record - stats\nChelsea have not won at White Hart Lane since a 4-2 victory in October 2012 (drawing two and losing two since).\nTottenham are unbeaten at White Hart Lane this season, winning eight and drawing two; their longest unbeaten start to a Premier League season at home since 2000-01 (13 games).\nSpurs haven't lost a Premier League London derby at White Hart Lane under Mauricio Pochettino (winning eight and drawing four).\nTottenham scored with their only two shots on target in this match.\nDele Alli has equalled his 2015-16 goal tally (10). He has managed to do this in 19 appearances this season, compared to 33 last season.\nSpurs have never lost a Premier League match that Alli has scored in (16 games - winning 12, drawing four).\nThe only midfielders to reach 20 Premier League goals quicker than Alli (52 games) are Rafael van der Vaart (44) and Matt Le Tissier (50)\nOnly Mesut Ozil (22) has more Premier League assists since the start of 2015-16 than Christian Eriksen (20).\nThis was only the fourth occasion this season in the Premier League where Diego Costa has failed to produce a goal or an assist.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli\nWhat's next?\nTottenham play Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before resuming their league campaign at home to West Brom on Saturday 14 January.\nChelsea take on Peterborough in the FA Cup on Sunday before travelling to defending Premier League champions Leicester six days later."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 West Bromwich Albion\nHarry Kane struck a hat-trick as Tottenham moved second in the Premier League table with a display of total dominance against West Brom at White Hart Lane.\nSpurs equalled their club record of six straight Premier League wins with ease as they set about dismantling their visitors, amassing 10 shots and 78% possession by half-time.\nKane smartly lifted Christian Eriksen's neat through ball in off the upright, before Eriksen's own effort went in via Gareth McAuley.\nEngland striker Kane - who became a father this week - was a continued threat and he turned in Kyle Walker's low cross, before completing his treble with a low finish across Ben Foster.\nThere was one black mark for Spurs in the form of an injury to Jan Vertonghen, which boss Mauricio Pochettino said \"looks bad\".\nBut his side are now showing real momentum and they simply outclassed Tony Pulis' Baggies, who stay eighth.\nRelive Harry Kane's hat-trick against West Brom\nFootball Daily podcast: Treble caps 'brilliant week' for Kane\nUnstoppable Tottenham\nMauricio Pochettino's nine changes from the FA Cup win at Aston Villa returned Spurs to the line-up that beat league leaders Chelsea just under two weeks ago.\nUnderstandable, then, that his side bristled with energy and confidence. Eriksen and Dele Alli bounced around in midfield; Kyle Walker and Danny Rose constantly stayed advanced from full-back.\nThe high positions Walker and Rose took up saw West Brom's wide men Nacer Chadli and Matt Phillips pinned back, ensuring the away side could not escape in the early exchanges.\nIt broke the Baggies, who should have been more than two down at the break with Kane only finding the net once from seven first-half shots. The England striker was brilliantly denied on three occasions by Foster - who made eight saves in all.\nEven against a side set up to frustrate them, Pochettino's men never looked like they would be short of answers as they scored four goals for the third time in four league games.\nThere will be concern, however, over the injury to Vertonghen. He looked distraught after rolling his ankle in the second half and would appear a major doubt to face Manchester City next week.\nDaddy Kane's perfect week\n\"The week has been a whirlwind having a little daughter - to finish it off like this is the best way possible,\" said Kane afterwards.\nThe 23-year-old called Tottenham's collective display \"outstanding\", and his own efforts were just that.\nBut Kane's life is certainly made easier by the creative work on the flanks of Walker and Rose, and the guile and endless support running from Alli and Eriksen.\nEriksen's impact can tend to be slightly overlooked, given the the focus on England internationals Kane and Alli, but the Dane has now created 59 chances this season - 29 more than his next most prolific team-mate.\nKane was clearly in the mood to make use of this impressive support, and might easily have scored more than three - he ended the day with 11 shots.\nBut there is no doubting that his ability to make space in the box offers those around him a perfect target, and he now has 62 Premier League goals - reaching 60 faster than any Spurs player has done before.\nThreadbare Baggies?\nPulis admitted his side simply \"weren't on it\" at White Hart Lane and referenced the gap in class and points between seventh place in the Premier League and the top six.\nThe harsh truth is Kane alone bettered the entire West Brom team for touches in the opposition area.\n\"We need to improve and we are trying very, very hard behind the scenes to do that,\" said Pulis afterwards.\nJanuary signings seem inevitable then, not that there is need for panic with such a solid top-half position.\nPulis stressed that striker Saido Berahino - linked with Stoke - does not need to be sold in order for him to recruit. But expect the Baggies to make signings, with left-back perhaps one area of concern as once again Chris Brunt was forced to fill in at White Hart Lane.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane\nPenalty-box Harry - The stats you need\nKane has now scored 94% of his Premier League goals for Tottenham inside the box (58 of 62).\nThe defeat for West Brom marks their joint-heaviest Premier League defeat under Tony Pulis (along with 4-0 v Manchester City in October 2016).\nThe Baggies conceded more than twice in a Premier League away game for the first time since 16 January last year - 364 days ago (3-0 v Southampton).\nThe past 10 Premier League goals scored by Tottenham players have been netted by Harry Kane or Dele Alli (five each).\nNo player has scored more Premier League hat-tricks for Tottenham than Harry Kane (three, level with Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe).\nOnly Kevin de Bruyne (nine) has provided more assists than Christian Eriksen in the Premier League this season.\n'The biggest gap to seventh' - What the managers said\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was a great performance. We are showing a good maturity. The team learned a lot from last season and we [have] very good momentum. If you want to fight and challenge for big things we need to follow performances like Chelsea with this one.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We just weren't on it. Spurs were very good. You have to be on it against these teams. We were miles off it and it's disappointing. They have real quality. The top six in the Premier League this year, it could be the biggest gap ever to seventh, that's how far ahead of the rest of us they are.\"\nUp next?\nTottenham travel to Manchester City in a key game at the top of the table for the day's late kick-off on Saturday. West Brom host Sunderland at 15:00 GMT."

A minute's applause was also heard before the match and chants of 'only one Graham Taylor' were a frequent part of the afternoon.\nThe game was also attended by Taylor's wife Rita and daughters Joanne and Karen while at half-time a number of former Watford players went on to the pitch to talk about their memories of Taylor.\nMiddlesbrough's goalscoring problems continue\nAitor Karanka's side are the lowest goalscorers in the Premier League with only 17 in 21 matches.\nThey only had one effort on target - a Fabio shot palmed away by Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, who later suffered a back injury when he landed badly after he punched the ball away from Alvaro Negredo.\nCristhian Stuani wasted another rare chance for Boro as his lofted shot ended on top of the net.\nHowever, Karanka will be optimistic by Gestede's performance when he came on for the last 25 minutes following a \u00a36m move from Aston Villa earlier this month.\nWatford also have problems getting goals with captain Troy Deeney - one of three players to be booked along with team-mate Miguel Britos and Watford's Fabio in a late scuffle - now on a run of one goal in 14 games.\nHe did, however, set up Cleverley with a flick-on after a long throw but the midfielder, on loan from Everton, could only hit the post.\nBoro goalkeeper Victor Valdes also did well to save a shot from Doucoure and a header from Stefano Okaka.\nStats - a rare clean sheet for the Hornets\nWatford have not lost to Middlesbrough in the league since October 2012, seven games without defeat (won four, drawn three).\nThe Hornets ended a run of 10 successive Premier League games without a clean sheet, with their first shut-out since October 2016 (v Hull).\nMiddlesbrough have failed to score in five of their past seven Premier League games, recording just one win in that period (drew two, lost four).\nWatford have failed to score in the first half in 14 of their past 16 Premier League games.\nRudy Gestede has played 32 consecutive Premier League games without a win; the longest ever run in the competition.\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue (Watford)\nWhat they said\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri said: \"In the second half we had six or seven very good chances and hit the post so we were unlucky but I'm happy with the performance.\n\"In some of the games we were not lucky at all and today we were very unlucky, the important thing is to keep playing and the victory will come.\"\nOn the tribute to former Hornets manager Graham Taylor, Mazzarri said: \"It was beautiful, there were a lot of emotions, everyone was emotional.\n\"We wanted to give this victory to this great person who passed away and that is the only thing we missed.\"\nWatford captain Troy Deeney said: \"Today was more about Graham Taylor and not the result. It would have been nice to get a winner and dedicate it to him.\n\"You could see how emotional everyone was and it showed how much people care about him. Hopefully this game can be remembered for Graham and not the result. The main thing is we didn't lose.\n\"There are no words that I can use to sum up how great a man he was and we just wish his family all the best at this difficult time.\"\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka said: \"It was not the best game to watch, for us it was a good game and we showed once again we are a consistent team.\n\"I would like to have had more chances but they are a strong team and we had to defend.\n\"We will score goals, we have good players and we created chances but sometimes it is difficult if you are playing against a physical team.\n\"As a coach until the 31st (of January) you are always expecting for something to happen, the aim is to finish the transfer market with a better squad than we have got at the moment.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford are away at Bournemouth in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Middlesbrough entertain West Ham at the same time."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-0 Southampton\nSubstitute Joey Barton scored the second-half winner on his league return for Burnley, who saw off Southampton in a tight contest at Turf Moor.\nThe 34-year-old had only been on the field for five minutes when he fired in a low 25-yard free-kick which took a deflection before beating keeper Fraser Forster.\nSouthampton were the bigger threat for most of the match, and the Clarets also had Tom Heaton to thank for their eighth home league win of the season.\nThe England keeper had to be alert to pat down James Ward-Prowse's first-half header, and then in the closing moments made two outstanding one-handed saves to deny ex-Claret Jay Rodriguez and Josh Sims.\nFor Saints, who slip to 13th, it was fourth consecutive loss in the Premier League; Burnley climb to 10th after a third win in four.\nReaction from Saturday's other Premier League games\nBurnley rely on rearguard\nBurnley could be considered lucky to come away with all three points. They were weak in attack and had three shots on target in the entire match, with only Barton's deflected strike troubling Forster.\nWithout the disciplined defending and brilliant keeping of Heaton, Southampton might have ended their streak of three matches without a win.\nDefender Ben Mee was on hand to clear off the line from Dusan Tadic and Jeff Hendrick placed his body in front of a fierce Shane Long effort that appeared goalbound.\nAnd when the backline was beaten, Heaton was a brick wall as the last man. He reacted quickly to block Ward-Prowse's header before making two superb diving stops to prevent Rodriguez and then Sims, with the follow-up, from equalising. The second save was truly exceptional.\nWith 24 points from a possible 36 at home, Burnley are 10 points clear of the bottom three and appear a good bet to avoid a relegation battle.\nPositive signs for Saints\nSouthampton fans should not be too disheartened by the result.\nFour league defeats in four makes for bad reading, but there was little to fault in the display at Turf Moor.\nThey were competent in defence and a handful in attack, with Tadic, aside from the effort cleared by Mee, going close with an angled shot before Long's header rippled the side netting after the break.\nAnd had Heaton switched off in the final few moments, visiting manager Claude Puel would have been heading back to Hampshire with a deserved point.\nAs it is, the Saints continue to head down the table. They will now focus on arresting this losing run at home to champions Leicester next Sunday.\n'I want to repay Dyche'\nMatch-winner Barton - making his first Premier League start since May 2015 - said he wanted to prove to Burnley boss Dyche he made the correct decision in bringing the English midfielder back to Turf Moor.\nBarton had been training with the Clarets after leaving Rangers in mid-November. He had his contract terminated by the Scottish Premiership club following a training-ground altercation in September and was given a one-match suspension for breaking Scottish Football Association rules on gambling.\nHe has also been charged with misconduct, with the English FA claiming the midfielder has placed 1,260 bets in the past 10 years.\n\"It was an incredible thing for him to bring me back - to what he did and the circus that goes on around me,\" said Barton.\n\"Hopefully displays in the coming weeks will repay that faith.\"\nMan of the match - Tom Heaton (Burnley)\n'We have a group that give every inch'\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche:\n\"It's a good story with Barton today. He's worked hard since he came back. I know what Joey offers. He's had an interesting life and today was another strange twist in his interesting life.\n\"Every coach has a doubt but it's about conquering your doubts. He's only one player - we have a group of players here that give every inch.\n\"Southampton are a good side without a shadow of doubt.\n\"I thought the defensive unit in general was great. I praised Heaton on his focus and I praised him for keeping in the latter stages of the match.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel:\n\"We wasted many chances and the keeper made strong saves.\n\"It was a strong game for us. There was a good attitude and it was a good display. It was difficult to play against the long ball today.\n\"We showed the same spirit as we had showed in recent games. It was incredible to lose this game.\n\"It's important to continue this good work.\"\nSaints' Turf Moor run continues - the stats\nBurnley have won four consecutive home Premier League games for only the second time, after the won each of their first four home games ever in the competition back in 2009-10.\nSouthampton have not won any of their past four league visits to Burnley, last beating them there in the Championship in October 2007.\nDyche's side have won six of their past seven home league games (L1).\nSouthampton have failed to find the back of the net in four of their past five Premier League away games\nSaints' Premier League games this season have produced a league-low 17 first-half goals (eight for, nine against).\nBarton scored his first Premier League goal since April 2015 (for QPR v West Brom).\nWhat's next?\nBurnley have an FA Cup third-round replay against Sunderland on Tuesday and are then at Arsenal next Sunday (14:15 GMT). Southampton are at home to Norwich in their FA Cup third-round replay on Wednesday and follow that up with Sunday's midday kick-off against Leicester."

It's got to be the best goal I've scored.\"\nCarroll's attempts at scissor kicks in practice had left manager Slaven Bilic more than a little worried.\n\"With his history of injuries I go a bit crazy when he does that in training because you don't want him to get hurt,\" admitted the West Ham coach, while his Palace counterpart had nothing but admiration for the goal and its execution.\n\"It's a terrific finish from Andy Carroll and he's always had that in his locker,\" said Allardyce. \"The volley was outstanding.\"\nThe goal also impressed Chris Sutton and Martin Keown on BBC's Final Score, with former striker Sutton describing it as a \"contender for goal of the season.\"\nKeown compared Carroll's effort favourably with Olivier Giroud's 'scorpion' goal, also scored against Palace.\n\"There's a lot of instinct involved, but he knows what he's doing. Is it better than Giroud's scorpion? There was an element of chance with Giroud but Carroll knows exactly what he's doing,\" he said.\nMatch of the Day pundit Ian Wright, who played for both West Ham and Palace, said: \"The Carroll goal was as good as I've seen - better contact than Wayne Rooney's against Man City (in 2011).\"\nBilic's tweak puts Payet out of the picture\nMuch of the build-up to this match had revolved around West Ham's Dimitri Payet, who manager Slaven Bilic had revealed \"does not want to play\" for the club any more.\nBilic omitted the French midfielder from his matchday squad altogether, and his side looked to be lacking the kind of spark needed to break down a resilient Palace defence.\nBut a tactical switch from the Hammers boss, which saw Sam Byram replace Angelo Ogbonna at half-time, reaped dividends with a host of chances coming thanks to the rejigged four-at-the-back formation.\nAntonio menaced the Palace backline throughout the second half, and Lanzini popped up where Payet may have been had he played, but the errant midfielder will have slipped out of many minds following this fine second-half display by Bilic's side.\nProblems for Palace\nAllardyce had to deal with speculation over Christian Benteke's future prior to the game, stating that the Belgian international was \"not for sale\" and had a \"big part to play\" following rumours that the 26-year-old could leave a mere five months after he moved to Selhurst Park.\nThe striker made his presence felt, catching West Ham defender James Collins with his arm in the first half, and could have put his side ahead if their best chance had fallen to him rather than James Tomkins.\nThe ex-West Ham player stabbed the ball across the goal rather than on target from close range in what turned out to be the closest the Eagles came to scoring.\nThe south London side, who have now gone seven games without a win and are level on points with Hull City, look in need of fresh blood during the current transfer window.\nMan of the match - Andy Carroll\n'Let's talk about who did play today instead'\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"Payet is a great player so you are losing quality, but the team showed it is about the team and not individuals. This is a great example for that.\n\"So let's talk about Carroll, or Darren Randolph, or Mark Noble. Michail Antonio had flu and a temperature of 38.4C last night. He showed brilliant determination, brilliant quality. That's what I want to talk about.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"We don't have the capability to make sure we don't lose. That's the first thing to put right at a struggling club and at the moment we don't know how to get that result.\n\"Today after 70 minutes we didn't look in any real trouble, but once we gifted them the first goal we lost our shape and our discipline.\nWhat happens next?\nWest Ham travel to Middlesbrough on Saturday, 21 January at 15:00 GMT, while Palace have two games in the next week. They replay Bolton Wanderers at home in the third round of the FA Cup on Tuesday, 17 January at 20:00, then host Everton next Saturday at 15:00.\nAntonio is Mr Assist - the stats you need\nMichail Antonio is the first West Ham player to provide three assists in a Premier League game since Paolo Di Canio vs Coventry in April 2000.\nCrystal Palace lost their fifth consecutive Premier League London derby, equalling their worst such run in the competition (five games, last done in March 1998).\nAndy Carroll has scored five goals in his last three home Premier League London derbies for West Ham.\nManuel Lanzini has scored a goal in each of his four Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace; double the amount he's scored against any other Premier League club.\nAntonio has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other West Ham player this season - 11 (8 goals, 3 assists).\nIndeed, Antonio recorded his first Premier League assists since April 2016 (v Arsenal) and it's the first time he has bagged three in an English league game."

That's important for me.\n\"After 10-15 minutes it was difficult, but we started to control the game and put the other team back. The first 25-30 minutes of the second half it was all our team.\n\"I start to see [progress]. We have time next week to work more and the players now believe more in our ideas.\n\"I saw my players smile in the dressing room and that's important for me.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"We got the perfect start and from that point we were looking to consolidate and then it slipped away. The second half was tough to watch.\n\"The frustrating thing is we didn't go for the game to try and put it to bed.\n\"We're disappointed with all three goals. We're in the middle of the season and we have everything to play for, Our season could still go two ways.\"\nHull end barren run - match stats\nHull enjoyed their first win in their last 10 Premier League games (D3 L6).\nBournemouth have conceded exactly three goals in seven of their last nine top-flight games.\nEddie Howe's side have registered just two wins in their last 13 top-flight away games, drawing two and losing nine.\nArtur Boruc is the fourth Polish player to make 100 Premier League appearances (also Wojciech Szczesny 132, Jerzy Dudek 127 and Lukas Fabianski 127).\nRyan Fraser has won three penalties in the Premier League this season, a joint-high figure (level with Dele Alli and Christian Benteke).\nJunior Stanislas has been involved in 14 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (seven goals, seven assists), a joint high along with team-mate Charlie Daniels.\nAbel Hernandez netted a brace in this game, as many goals as in his previous 30 Premier League appearances.\nRobert Snodgrass has been directly involved in 10 of Hull's 20 Premier League goals this season (seven goals, three assists).\nWhat's next?\nHull are back in Premier League action on Sunday, 22 January with a tough trip to Stamford Bridge to face leaders Chelsea (16:30 GMT), while Bournemouth host Watford on Saturday, 21 January (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 0-4 Arsenal\nArsenal returned to the top four with a handsome victory at Swansea City, consigning Paul Clement to a demoralising defeat in his first Premier League game in charge of the hosts.\nHaving initially been frustrated by their opponents, the Gunners led at half-time thanks to Olivier Giroud's powerful, close-range finish.\nAlex Iwobi's strike looped in via a big deflection off Jack Cork to double their advantage, and Kyle Naughton scored a second Swansea own goal when he turned another Iwobi shot into his own net.\nAlexis Sanchez completed the rout to lift Arsenal up to third in the table, while Hull's win over Bournemouth means Swansea return to the bottom of the table.\nDespite some encouraging signs early in the game, this was a stark reminder to former Bayern Munich assistant manager Clement of the enormous task he faces to steer the Swans to safety.\nBy contrast, the ruthless nature of Arsenal's display - particularly in an extremely one-sided second half - will surely give Arsene Wenger renewed hope of mounting a serious title challenge.\nWenger tips Swansea to stay up\nRelive Arsenal's thrashing of Swansea\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches\nArsenal ease their away-day blues\nThe Gunners' bid for a first title since 2004 had stuttered lately, largely due to an away record of one point from their past three Premier League matches on the road.\nAlthough they started slowly against the high-pressing Swans, the visitors settled thanks to a goal from an increasingly reliable source.\nGiroud started this game with 12 goals from his past 17 shots on target, and the France striker was clinical with his first effort on this occasion, seizing on Mesut Ozil's blocked header and firing the ball into the roof of the net from six yards.\nArsenal took control from that point and a period of concerted pressure early in the second half saw the floodgates open.\nThere was an element of luck about the second and third goals, but they were no more than the Gunners deserved for their dominance of possession and inventive use of it around the Swansea penalty area.\nThe irrepressible Sanchez finally got in on the act after 73 minutes, volleying in from close range to score his 21st goal in 32 Premier League appearances.\nClement's tall order\nThere was a certain symmetry to Clement's first league game in charge, coming as it did against an Arsenal side who had beaten Swansea 3-2 at the start of his predecessor Bob Bradley's short tenure.\nOne of Clement's priorities is to improve the Swans' defence - the most porous in the top flight - and the way his players shackled Arsenal early on with their high pressing was encouraging.\nBut after falling behind, the home side simply collapsed.\nThey were slack in their marking and slow to react to the Gunners' movement, summed up by the space in which Sanchez found himself in the Swansea box when he scored the fourth.\nSwansea find themselves back at the bottom of the table and with a tough run of fixtures to come - Liverpool and Manchester City are two of their next three opponents.\nThe threat of relegation is as startling a reality as ever.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\n'They had problems containing us'\nSwansea boss Paul Clement: \"It is very disappointing. The first half we were in the game and looked solid defensively, even though we did not do enough offensively. We got caught on the counter for the first goal.\n\"We had a big claim for a penalty. Looking back on it, it is a penalty. In the second half, we started poorly and then it was an uphill struggle after the first own goal. Arsenal showed how much quality they have offensively.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"The first half was very intense physically, they gave a lot in the first half and then our pace took over. They had problems containing us.\n\"In the second half, you could see we could create chances. Our transition and accuracy of passing was very good. We were fortunate with the goals, but the chances were there.\"\nMatch of the Day analysis\nEx-England midfielder Danny Murphy: \"Arsenal have missed Mesut Ozil for a few games but he made a big difference against Swansea. Ozil was exceptional in crucial areas of the pitch.\n\"He makes the right decisions nine times out of 10. Ozil gives that extra quality and class in final third. Arsenal are a better team when he is in it. Alexis Sanchez and Ozil together make Arsenal an exceptional and dangerous team.\n\"Paul Clement will be on training pitch as long as he can. He is a workaholic. He will be quite savvy in the transfer market. He will improve Swansea but whether it will be enough, we'll have to wait and see.\"\nEx-Arsenal striker Ian Wright on Swansea's penalty appeal: \"Swans boss Paul Clement said he thought it was a penalty. I didn't think it was. Ki Sung-yueng was searching for the (Laurent Koscielny's) foot and I think he kicks the foot. Those have been given.\"\nOn Sanchez's reaction to being taken off: \"He is disappointed. He doesn't want to be taken off. He's so integral to Arsenal. If Sanchez is not there, there is massive problem.\"\nWhat's next?\nIt does not get any easier for Swansea as they travel to Liverpool next Saturday (kick-off 12:30 GMT), while Arsenal host Burnley on Sunday, 22 January (kick-off 14:15).\nSanchez central to Arsenal - stats of the day\nArsenal have scored 27 goals away from home in the Premier League this season, at least five more than any other side.\nThe Gunners have scored four or more goals in four away Premier League games this season, their most in a single campaign since 2002-03.\nGiroud has scored in each of his past nine starts, netting 11 goals in total.\nSanchez has been involved in more goals (21) than any other Premier League player this season (14 goals, seven assists).\nSwansea became the first team to score two own goals in a Premier League match since QPR against Liverpool in October 2014.\nThe Swans have conceded four or more goals in three of their past five Premier League home games, having only let in four or more in three of their previous 62 league games at the Liberty Stadium."

        "article_text": "Sunderland 1-3 Stoke City\nSunderland remain in the relegation zone following a sixth Premier League home defeat after Marko Arnautovic's two goals helped Stoke City to victory.\nThe Potters stunned the hosts with three goals in 19 first-half minutes, Arnautovic scoring his first at the second attempt after Vito Mannone had saved his initial shot.\nAustria international Arnautovic's composed finish doubled the lead before Peter Crouch's header from Charlie Adam's cross made it 3-0.\nSunderland got a goal back when Jermain Defoe beat Lee Grant with his first chance after Donald Love's long pass.\nHowever, David Moyes' side were second best throughout and slipped to 19th in the table, one point from safety.\nSunderland's day went from bad to worse when team-mates Patrick van Aanholt and Adnan Januzaj argued with one another on the pitch in the closing stages.\nRelive the action from the Stadium of Light\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nWill Moyes strengthen his defence?\nThere were few home fans left inside the Stadium of Light when Mike Dean signalled the end of a game Stoke won with the aid of more poor Sunderland defending.\nThe Black Cats would have climbed out of the relegation zone for the first time since August had they won.\nHowever, they have managed just two top-flight clean sheets this season and they found themselves behind after just 15 minutes.\nArnautovic was unmarked for both his goals while Crouch took advantage of poor goalkeeping by Vito Mannone to score his 99th Premier League goal and his 48th headed goal in the competition.\nAll the talk in the build-up had been about Moyes trying to keep Defoe from the clutches of Sunderland's Premier League rivals during the January transfer window.\nYet the Sunderland boss needs to shore up his defence to stand any chance of staying up.\nWith money tight at Sunderland, it remains to be seen if he will be able to find a solution to his side's woeful defensive record before the window closes.\nWill Stoke land Berahino?\nStoke's travelling fans have not had a lot to cheer about recently, their previous three away games all ending in defeat with 11 goals conceded.\nIn addition, they arrived in Sunderland on the back of an FA Cup home defeat at the hands of Championship Wolverhampton Wanders.\nYet Mark Hughes saw his side pick Sunderland a part to climb to ninth in the table.\nArnautovic's finishing, despite Sunderland's lapses at the back, was of the highest quality.\nHis first was instinctive after Mannone had saved his initial effort while the second seven minutes later came after he exchanged passes with first Xherdan Shaqiri and then Crouch before beating the keeper at his near post.\nHughes is hoping to secure the signing of West Brom forward Saido Berahino, 23, in the transfer window though 35-year-old Crouch has now scored in his last three Premier League appearances.\nIt could have been worse for Sunderland. Shortly before Crouch made it 3-0, Shaqiri almost embarrassed Mannone from distance only for the Swiss midfielder's shot to hit a post.\nMan of the Match - Marko Arnautovic (Stoke City)\n'Players need to take responsibility'\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"The first 20 minutes or so was really poor. All our own doing, terrible mistakes for all three goals.\n\"The players need to take responsibility and stop making individual mistakes, but I didn't think our overall performance was that bad.\n\"The fans left early because there is only one road out of here, not just because of the result. They actually leave when we are winning as well sometimes.\"\nStoke City boss Mark Hughes: \"To a man I thought they were absolutely fantastic.\n\"The football we played during the first 30 minutes or so of the first half was as good as anything we have produced away from home for several years in my opinion.\n\"We have never finished seventh or eighth in the Premier League before so that is undoubtedly our aim over the final few months of the season.\"\nRodwell's Sunderland agony continues\nJack Rodwell has yet to be on the winning side in any of his 35 Premier League starts for Sunderland.\nThe Black Cats became just the second team not to use any of their substitutes in a Premier League game this season, after Hull against Leicester on the opening day.\nStoke have beaten Sunderland twice in the same league season for the first time since 1993-94.\nOnly Jonathan Walters (41) and Peter Crouch (36) have scored more Premier League goals for Stoke City than Marko Arnautovic (19, level with Charlie Adam).\nArnautovic scored his first Premier League goals in 12 games, since netting against Crystal Palace in September.\nNext up?\nSunderland could probably do without a midweek FA Cup third-round replay at Burnley but that is what they have got on Tuesday (19:45 GMT). Stoke have a full week to prepare for Manchester United's visit next Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

Leicester travel to Southampton for a 12:00 kick-off on the same day, hoping for their first away win of a disappointing domestic season.\nChelsea make another fast start - the stats you need\nChelsea have scored five goals in the opening 10 minutes of Premier League matches so far this season - a division high.\nThe Blues have already picked up more points this season (52) than they managed in the whole of 2015-16 (50).\nThe Foxes' two defeats in their past three home league games is as many as they lost in their previous 30.\nThis was Leicester's heaviest Premier League home defeat since September 2015 (2-5 v Arsenal).\nPedro has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season than the whole of last season (10 - five goals, five assists)."

After FA Cup defeat to Leicester last weekend an angry Koeman demanded the club's hierarchy \"opened its eyes\".\nThe \u00a324m signing of Morgan Schneiderlin lifted some gloom but the roars for his 65th-minute appearance from the bench were dwarfed by the noise in injury time when Lookman, newly arrived from Charlton, made his mark.\nKoeman was bold in starting with Davies and 20-year-old defender Mason Holgate, but pragmatic in his game plan. City have had over 50% of the ball in every league outing this season but Everton sat and soaked up possession comfortably.\nLeighton Baines slid in to deny Raheem Sterling an opening early on and, Davies' header off the line apart, the home goal never looked under serious threat.\nThe Toffees ran further and produced more sprints than the visitors, while with the ball they were direct, springing attacks through Lukaku, who proved a handful for City's ragged back four.\nDavies ran further than anyone on the pitch and released Mirallas in the build-up to the opening goal, before being involved in the second and cleverly chipping in the third after a driving run from his own half.\nSchneiderlin could threaten the 18-year-old's place but Koeman will welcome such a selection dilemma.\nThe Dutchman knows his team are far from a finished article but this win showed all they could be.\nListen: 'Man Utd & Man City won't win the title'\nListen: 'City don't have an outstanding goalkeeper at the moment'\nSoft-centred City pose questions for Pep\n\"It looks like the title challenge is beyond City,\" BBC Radio 5 live pundit Kevin Kilbane said at the end of match where the visitors' soft centre was all too apparent and clinically exploited.\nAfter 10 games of the season Guardiola's side topped the table on 23 points, but 11 matches later he now says they are too far adrift.\nThe warning signs were there in those opening 10 games, where City kept two only clean sheets.\nTheir defensive predicament has continued and at Goodison Everton's direct balls repeatedly took the City midfield out of the game, exposing a back four which seemed to have little understanding as a unit.\nVincent Kompany's persistent injuries have created a hole in the heart of defence that John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi have been unable to fill with authority, while in central midfield, Pablo Zabaleta's performance was robust but his quality on the ball is no substitute for the silky Ilkay Gundogan.\nZabaleta had played 30 passes by the time he went off on the hour, 40 fewer than Yaya Toure.\nIndividual mistakes also proved costly. Toure took a heavy touch for Everton's killer second goal, while Gael Clichy sloppily lost possession for the first.\nCity have now conceded more goals than any other in the top seven, while goalkeeper Bravo has been beaten by 14 of the last 22 shots on target.\nGuardiola has answers to find.\nMan of the match - Tom Davies (Everton)\n'Perfect Everton' - What the managers said\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"We scored at the right time in the first half and then to score straight after half-time made it very difficult for them.\n\"I think it is a big compliment to Everton today - the organisation defensively. It makes the final result and the way we played perfect.\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"In so many games we create enough chances to but when they arrive they score and the second time they arrive they score.\n\"That for the mind of the players is tough, mentally tough and that is why we have to keep going be strong and work harder.\"\nLookman follows Eto'o at Everton - the key stats\nThis was Everton's biggest ever Premier League win over Man City.\nEverton scored with all four of their shots on target.\nIn four of their last seven Premier League games, Manchester City have conceded with the first shot they've faced.Everton 4-0 Manchester City\nRomelu Lukaku has been involved in eight goals in his last nine home Premier League games (five goals, three assists).\nThe first shot of the game came in the 25th minute, the second-longest wait for the opening shot of a Premier League game this season after Watford versus Middlesbrough on January 14th (26th minute).\nTom Davies and Ademola Lookman became the 16th and 17th different teenagers to score a Premier League goal for Everton; the joint-most in the competition with Arsenal.\nLookman was the first Toffees player to score on their Premier League debut since Samuel Eto'o in August 2014 against Chelsea.\nUp next?\nManchester City host second-placed Tottenham in a 17:30 GMT kick-off on Saturday, shortly after Everton seek just a second away win in eight matches when they play at Crystal Palace at 15:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 Liverpool\nZlatan Ibrahimovic's late equaliser earned Manchester United a point they fully deserved after a typically thunderous encounter with Liverpool at Old Trafford.\nLiverpool led through James Milner's 27th-minute penalty, awarded after Paul Pogba inexplicably handled a corner as he went up to challenge Dejan Lovren.\nGoalkeeper Simon Mignolet was Liverpool's hero with superb first-half saves from Ibrahimovic's free-kick and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, as Jurgen Klopp's side put up stern resistance and threatened on the break.\nIt looked like the visitors were going to hold on and move back to second in the Premier League, but United finally forced the goal they merited when Antonio Valencia reacted first when substitute Marouane Fellaini's header came back off the post, crossing for Ibrahimovic to head home off the bar.\nLiverpool are now in third place, seven points adrift of top-flight leaders Chelsea, while United - whose nine-match winning run in all competitions came to an end - are now 12 points off the top.\nWe bettered 'long-ball' United - Klopp\nRelive Manchester United v Liverpool\nFootball Daily podcast: 'Man Utd & Man City won't win title'\nMignolet rewards Klopp's faith\nReds boss Klopp had no hesitation in restoring Mignolet in goal, despite the midweek heroics of Loris Karius in defeat in the EFL Cup semi-final first leg at Southampton.\nKlopp has decided, for now at least, that the Belgium international is his first choice - and Mignolet demonstrated exactly why on Sunday.\nMignolet's decision-making has often been questioned, but he has always been capable of making outstanding saves. And so it proved in this draw.\nHe rescued Liverpool twice in the first half with a brilliant reflex save from Ibrahimovic's fierce free-kick and a decisive advance from goal to make a one-handed block from Mkhitaryan.\nKlopp has had to make big decisions with his keepers this season - and this one was fully justified by Mignolet.\nIbrahimovic United's talisman - again\nIbrahimovic may be 35 and in the twilight of a wonderful career - but he is the new talisman of Manchester United and the leader of Mourinho's team.\nThis may not have been the former Sweden striker's best performance of the season but he was still the man who made the difference and produced the decisive contribution when United needed him.\nIbrahimovic brings a winner's mentality to Old Trafford and it showed when he raced back to the centre circle after his 19th goal of a stellar season, finger pointing to the skies before whirling his arms around demanding more noise and support from United's fans in the closing moments.\nHe has now scored 14 goals in his first 20 Premier League games since joining last summer - the same total as Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, former Southampton, Blackburn and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, and ex-Coventry City forward Micky Quinn.\nPogba's nightmare\nPogba's Manchester United career has been a slow-burner - but he has come into his own throughout United's recent run of victories.\nThis, however, will be a game he will surely want to forget as quickly as possible as the \u00a389m man endured a nightmare from first to last.\nPogba revealed his own emoji before the game, but he will have wanted to keep his profile as low as possible after needlessly conceding a penalty and missing a clear chance when he raced through earlier in the first half.\nThe 23-year-old France midfielder is a player of undoubted quality but this was not his finest 90 minutes.\nWas referee Oliver too lenient?\nThis was a match short on high quality but one that still had plenty of action and incident to keep the capacity Old Trafford crowd occupied to the final whistle.\nLiverpool - who, despite keeper Mignolet's fine work, had opportunities themselves in the second half, especially when Roberto Firmino forced a save from David de Gea - even had a chance to win the game after Ibrahimovic's late leveller.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum missed that good chance, so honours were even in a game that had plenty of talking points.\nReferee Michael Oliver was a central figure in two second-half incidents that could have brought red cards from the official.\nUnited substitute Wayne Rooney was lucky to escape serious punishment for an ugly challenge on James Milner that left his former England team-mate requiring lengthy treatment.\nAnd Firmino was also arguably fortunate to receive only a yellow card for a two-handed shove on Ander Herrera, referee Oliver perhaps taking his frustration into account because he was reacting to being crudely dragged back by the shirt by the United midfield man as he tried to break free.\nOliver will also have noted the extremely theatrical reaction from Herrera as he fell to the ground, an incident which brought the two managers together on the touchline. This may well have helped him come to his decision.\nSome will accuse Oliver of leniency but both Jose Mourinho and Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp appeared to feel he had handled the incidents sensibly - other officials may not have reacted in the same fashion.\nMan of the match - Simon Mignolet\nWhat they said:\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"I didn't think the game had super quality. We didn't reflect the qualities we have and Liverpool have - but it was very emotional, intense, aggressive. We fought until the last second.\n\"They were clever. They took their time, they know how to play football and control the emotions of the game. They knew they would be in trouble in the final few minutes.\n\"We were the team that attacked and Liverpool were the team that defended - let's see if the critics are fair. I enjoyed it but I will obviously be disappointed we didn't get the three points.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"In the end period of the game when United started playing long balls after 80 minutes of high intense football it is really hard.\n\"I hoped we would have a bit of luck, unfortunately not but all good. Tomorrow I can enjoy the result, but tonight only the performance.\n\"It is so intense. They play long balls, it was a wild game. There was a lot of action in the last few minutes. We were here to win the game, which is why we we are not 100% satisfied.\"\nMilner a good luck charm - the stats\nOnly Dwight Yorke and Ruud van Nistelrooy (15) scored more goals for Manchester United in their first 20 Premier League games than Ibrahimovic's 14.\nLiverpool have scored six penalties at Old Trafford - the most by a team on an opposition ground in the Premier League.\nMilner has scored his past 10 penalties in the Premier League, including all seven for Liverpool.\nThe former England international has lost none of the 46 top-flight games in which he has scored (37 wins), equalling the record held by ex-Aston Villa forward Darius Vassell.\nWayne Rooney became the 17th outfield player to play 450 Premier League games.\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has lost just one of his seven matches against a side managed by Jose Mourinho, winning three.\nThis is the first time since the 1987-88 season that both league games between these sides ended as a draw.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool are in FA Cup action when they travel to League Two side Plymouth Argyle for a third-round replay at 19:45 GMT on Wednesday. Their next league game is at home against Swansea at 12:30 on Saturday, with Manchester United visiting Stoke City at 15:00 on the same day."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 2-3 Swansea City\nSwansea lifted themselves off the bottom of the Premier League table and dealt a huge blow to Liverpool's title hopes with a thrilling win at Anfield.\nGylfi Sigurdsson scored from close range with 16 minutes left to give Paul Clement his first win as Swans boss and the club their first away league victory over the Reds.\nRoberto Firmino had struck twice to draw the hosts level after Fernando Llorente's two goals in four minutes after the break.\nThe defeat leaves Liverpool seven points behind leaders Chelsea, who now have a game in hand, at home against Hull on Sunday.\nThe Tigers are one of three teams, along with Sunderland and Crystal Palace, leapfrogged by Swansea, who move up to 17th after only their second win in eight league games.\nRelive Swansea's surprise win over Liverpool\nSaturday's Premier League action\nSwansea looking up\nIn the wake of last weekend's demoralising 4-0 defeat by Arsenal, Clement said Swansea would be \"naive\" to ignore the possibility of Premier League relegation this season.\nOn the evidence of their performance at Anfield, it would be equally naive of anyone to write them off.\nIn the space of seven days they have gone from a side who collapsed at the first setback to one capable of rallying under extreme pressure.\nTheir first-half defensive display - which saw them restrict Liverpool to a couple of half-chances - belied their status as the club with the division's most porous defence.\nTheir second-half performance was clinical, epitomised by Llorente's two strikes - a close-range finish following Federico Fernandez's header from a corner, followed by a header from Tom Carroll's cross - and Sigurdsson's decisive, well-placed finish. These were their only three efforts on target.\nIt was also gutsy. They had to dig very deep against a side who, before Saturday, were unbeaten in the league in over a year at home and who had scored 26 goals in their previous nine league games.\nLiverpool stumble again\nIn the programme for this match, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp described October's encounter with Swansea in Wales - a 2-1 win sealed by a late James Milner penalty - as \"one of the toughest we have had all season.\"\nThe German may feel the need to revise that after Saturday's game.\nDespite having Philippe Coutinho back in the side - and ending the game with Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge on the pitch - the Reds were short of attacking invention and strength in the absence of Sadio Mane, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal.\nTheir failure to move the ball quickly enough in the first half meant they did not properly test Swansea's packed defence.\nAnd while Firmino scored his first goals in six games - the first a header from Milner's cross, the second a fierce finish after he had chested down Georginio Wijnaldum's delivery - a total of five shots on target and an Adam Lallana deflected effort against the bar is scant product from nearly 75% possession.\nWith this result coming after successive away draws at Sunderland and Manchester United, the Reds are in danger of allowing a title challenge to slip away before February has even begun.\nTheir next game, at home to the league leaders, is now surely a must win.\nMan of the match - Fernando Llorente (Swansea)\nWhat the managers said...\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It's hard to accept. In the first half we created four or five chances which we didn't take.\n\"The start of the second half we were poor and then we played brilliantly and scored two. Then we were a bit passive and one player was alone in our box, which is completely senseless.\n\"The most disappointing moment was the third goal and I can't explain it as we had so many chances to challenge.\n\"It's really difficult to accept at this moment. It is fair Swansea won, no - but was it deserved, yes.\"\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: \"We frustrated Liverpool and defended really well. We showed great togetherness and it was a massive team effort.\n\"At half-time I told the players we would get at least one chance, but to get three was unbelievable.\n\"It's very important for the confidence of the side that we can come to a big team and get a result. We need to work hard on the training pitch and make sure we get another result in 10 days' time.\"\nReds first to 50 goals - the stats you need to know\nLiverpool's unbeaten Premier League run at Anfield has ended after 17 matches (11 wins, six draws).\nFirmino has scored three goals in his past two Premier League games against Swansea.\nLlorente has now scored eight Premier League goals but his first two away from home.\nLiverpool conceded three goals at Anfield in a league game for only the second time under Klopp.\nThe Reds are the first Premier League team score 50 goals this season, while Swansea are the first to concede 50 (both now on 51).\nSwansea have won back-to-back away league games in the same season for the first time since May 2015.\nWhat next?\nLiverpool will attempt to overturn a 1-0 deficit when they host Southampton in the EFL Cup semi-final second leg on Wednesday (kick-off 20:00 GMT). The Reds then welcome Wolves to Anfield in the FA Cup fourth round on 28 January (12:30), before another home game - the big one in the Premier League against Chelsea - at 20:00 on 31 January.\nSwansea's involvement in the FA Cup ended in the last round so their next game is at home against Southampton in the Premier League on 31 January (19:45)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 2-2 Watford\nBenik Afobe scored a late equaliser as a nervy Bournemouth twice came from behind to salvage a point against Watford at Vitality Stadium.\nThe visitors took the lead midway through the first half as Christian Kabasele headed in from a corner, following a series of errors by the hosts.\nJoshua King levelled soon after the interval from Adam Smith's cross, before Troy Deeney exploited more lax defending to restore Watford's lead.\nBut Afobe grabbed a late equaliser when he ran onto Andrew Surman's through ball and finished low into the bottom corner.\nCharlie Daniels thought he had claimed a dramatic winner in stoppage time but his effort was correctly ruled out for a handball by Steve Cook.\nBournemouth have now won just one of the last seven games in all competitions, while Watford are winless in their last seven Premier League games.\nRelive the action from Vitality Stadium\nReaction from all of Saturday's matches\nCherries crumble in defence once more\nWith increased scrutiny on their defensive frailties, having conceded nine goals in their previous three games, Bournemouth's back four will have welcomed the early control their midfield provided before everything unravelled midway through the first half.\nCentre-back Tyrone Mings under-hit a backpass under pressure, forcing Artur Boruc to hack his clearance straight to a Watford player, before Ryan Fraser played another poor pass that Stefano Okaka ran onto to win a corner off Mings.\nFrom the set-piece, Steve Cook flicked the ball across his own box, allowing Miguel Britos to rise above his marker and find Kabasele in space to steer in with his head.\nAfter scoring an own goal in his first Premier League start against Hull last weekend, Mings looked shaky again, frequently conceding possession and given little protection by the rest of the Cherries defence, who were culpable for Watford's second goal.\nTom Cleverley, making his first start for the Hornets since joining on loan from Everton, whipped a corner into the six-yard box that Boruc failed to deal with, as Deeney defied the attentions of three Bournemouth defenders to glance in a fine header.\nWith Simon Francis sitting out the third of his three-game ban, Nathan Ake having been recalled by parent club Chelsea and Marc Wilson out with a hamstring injury, there are clear factors behind Bournemouth's recent defensive struggles but they will need to improve quickly to prevent a season of promise falling away.\nAttack is the best form of defence\nDespite all those defensive worries, Bournemouth remain a pleasure to watch going forward and, as the old adage goes, attack may prove to be their best form of defence.\nForwards Callum Wilson and King came back into the side from the start and their movement provided opportunities to get in behind the Watford defence.\nJack Wilshere took advantage early on as he chipped an exquisite through ball for Fraser drifting into space to loop a header over Heurelho Gomes, only for the Hornets keeper to get back and tip it over.\nGomes made another couple of solid saves from Wilshere and Junior Stanislas towards the end of the first half, before the hosts levelled minutes after the break. Right-back Smith weaved his way clear down the right to pick out King to score with Gomes dragged out of position.\nA second goal seemed to be a formality for Bournemouth at this point, as they saw an appeal for a penalty against Abdoulaye Doucoure for handball turned down before Fraser drew a fine save from Gomes, only for Deeney to put Watford back in front.\nYet Eddie Howe was prepared to gamble, sending on Jordon Ibe and Afobe. The striker checked his late run adeptly to take advantage of Kabasele lying down injured and collect Surman's pass before firing low beyond Gomes' dive.\nWatford may complain that Bournemouth should have put the ball out, but the hosts were within their rights to play on and ultimately claim a deserved equaliser.\nMan of the match - Jack Wilshere (Bournemouth)\nWatford find no way to win away\nAfobe's equaliser means Watford have gone seven Premier League games without a win, including three draws and four losses.\nHowever, there were clear signs of improvement here as they doubled their tally of goals from those previous six games.\nBoth goals resulted from well-worked set pieces and Walter Mazzarri's side had a clear tactic to induce panic in Bournemouth's defence, with Deeney and Okaka menacing Mings on the ball and Jose Holebas launching long throws from anywhere within 20 yards of the box.\nThe Hornets were not just one-note though, showing some neat touches in possession as they wrested control following both goals, although they perhaps went too defensive after Deeney's goal, but were rightly not punished late on as referee Lee Mason spotted Cook's blatant handball before Daniels struck.\nUltimately, this game may have been destined to finish level, with all four Premier League ties between these two sides who came up together from the Championship in 2014-15, having ended in draws.\nWhat the managers said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It's a strange one for us, as we played so well in patches. They showed great character to bounce back. The goals we conceded were soft from our perspective, ours were great but it's frustrating to give cheap ones away.\n\"We worked so hard for the goals, but we need to be better at the back for sure.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"I'm disappointed as we deserved to win but made two mistakes and paid the price. But overall, I am happy with the performance.\n\"We've been playing with young players and a lot of them are growing. This is positive and we are slowly getting the team we want now.\"\nWhen asked about Benik Afobe's equaliser, which was scored while Christian Kabasele was down injured, Mazzarri said: \"I prefer to not comment on any refereeing decisions today.\"\nAfobe on a roll\nAll four of the Premier League meetings between these sides have ended level (0-0, 1-1, 2-2 and 2-2).\nBenik Afobe has netted two goals in his last three Premier League appearances for Bournemouth; as many as in 25 outings beforehand.\nJoshua King's goal was his first at Vitality Stadium since April (v Liverpool).\nAdam Smith has provided four assists in the Premier League this season; only Kyle Walker (5) has provided more among defenders.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth have a break before hosting Crystal Palace in the Premier League on 31 January. Watford travel to Millwall in the FA Cup fourth round on 29 January before they are away at Arsenal in the league two days later."

Our player was injured and that's a decision the referee should have made. I don't think it's the responsibility of the players.\"\nSo should play have been stopped?\nTaylor was under no obligation to stop play because of Schlupp's injury, with Fifa rules stipulating that an official is allowed to let play continue if a player is deemed to be \"only slightly injured\".\nThe rule adds that play should only be stopped \"if, in the opinion of the referee, a player is seriously injured\".\nIn Schlupp's case, he appeared to be struggling with cramp, while pictures of the incident appear to show him initially off the field of play before returning to the pitch when receiving treatment.\n'We are more aggressive'\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"We contained a very good Everton team today, we just didn't get the break. We hit the bar and their goalie made a great save from a free-kick.\n\"I think we are making improvements. The players are having to play to a different system. It's also a learning curve for me, getting to know each player.\n\"I have been here before, I wouldn't say I enjoy it, but with the help of my back room staff, we'll get out of this.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"In my opinion it was well deserved, overall we were the better football team and had the best chances in the game.\n\"Normally if you don't take your chances the opposition might punish you, but we scored one and kept a clean sheet.\n\"Since our victory against Arsenal in December, we have changed our attitude. We are more aggressive and that is why I think we are winning.\"\nMan of the match - Ross Barkley (Everton)\nMore late pain for Palace - match stats\nSam Allardyce has suffered four consecutive Premier League defeats for the first time since December 2015 (a run of five with Sunderland).\nThe Eagles have now lost three of their last four home league games to a goal scored in the 87th minute or later.\nThe Toffees, meanwhile, have won three consecutive Premier League games without conceding for the first time since January 2010 (under David Moyes).\nNo defender has scored more goals (excluding pens) than Seamus Coleman in the Premier League this season (4 - level with Gareth McAuley).\nTom Davies has been directly involved in three goals in his last three league games for Everton (one goal, two assists).\nIndeed, Everton have won six of the eight Premier League games Tom Davies has played this season (D1 L1).\nWhat's next?\nPalace's next outing comes with a home FA Cup fourth-round tie against Manchester City on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Everton - already out of the cup - have a weekend off before returning to Premier League action on Wednesday, 1 February at Stoke City (20:00 GMT)."

The Sunderland defender appeared to punch Fletcher at a West Brom corner.\nBlunt Sunderland fail to fire\nSunderland managed just two shots in the first-half, only one of which was on target, a weak attempt by their top scorer Jermain Defoe in the 41st minute.\nDefoe, 34, has scored 12 of their 20 Premier League goals this season, but the former England striker struggled to make an impact.\nHe managed just two touches in the West Brom box in the first-half, while as a team Sunderland only had seven touches in Foster's area.\nThings did improve after the break with sevens shots and two on target - but with six of them from outside the box, West Brom rarely looked in much danger.\nSunderland's best opportunities to fight back came from set pieces but too often the delivery was poor, with Sebastian Larsson and Patrick van Aanholt particularly culpable.\nVictor Anichebe gave his side a boost when he came off the bench for the last half hour as he returned from injury, but it looked as if Sunderland will need to strengthen their attack in the January transfer window if they are to have a chance of survival.\nMan of the match - Matt Phillips\nWhat the managers said...\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"First half we played really well. In the second you have to give credit to Sunderland, they had more of the game than they did in the first half.\n\"We have done very well. The players have really embraced what we are trying to do and the atmosphere was fantastic again.\n\"Darren Fletcher's goal was fantastic and Chris (Brunt) has a wand of a left foot. We are really pleased. We have a clean sheet in a game that was always going to be difficult for us so we march on.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"We played better in the second than the first, that is for sure. We are giving poor goals away and we are doing everything we can to eradicate it, but it is a disease we have got at the moment.\n\"We led to our own downfall but credit to the boys and credit to young George Honeyman, who was our best player by a long way today. We can take some positives from the game.\n\"We are missing Lamine Kone at the back. He gives a steadying influence. This was always going to be a difficult period. We are making mistakes and I will take responsibility for that.\n\"We are not that far away (from safety). We have to keep going and hope our turn for results will come. We have given away two or three poor goals but our play is not particularly bad - but goals change games.\"\nStats - Hawthorns the fortress, no luck for Black Cats\nWest Brom have won five of their last six home Premier League games, having won just one of the nine before that.\nSunderland have lost five consecutive away Premier League games for the first time since November 2013.\nMoyes has lost five consecutive away Premier League games as manager for the first time since May 2005, when he was manager of Everton.\nWhat next?\nSunderland host Tottenham, while West Brom travel to Middlesbrough, with both games played on 31 January."

It is a great honour and I am very proud. It is difficult at the minute to be over-pleased because of the result, but in the grand scheme it is huge honour.\n\"It is not something I expected when I joined. I am proud and I hope there is more to come.\n\"The players who have played for this club have been world class.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"The record is the record. It is the record of the biggest club in England and one of the biggest in the world. Before him the record belonged to a legend of English football. Now Wayne becomes a legend of Manchester United.\"\nFormer record-holder Sir Bobby Charlton: \"I would be lying to say that I'm not disappointed to have lost the record.\n\"However, I can honestly say that I'm delighted for Wayne. He deserves his place in the history books.\n\"He is a true great for club and country, and it is fitting that he is now the highest goalscorer for both United and England.\"\nFormer Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson: \"Wayne thoroughly deserves his place in the history books of this great club and I am sure that he will go on to score many more goals.\n\"Well done Wayne, I am absolutely delighted for you, you have been a great servant to this club and long may it continue.\"\nStoke City manager and former Manchester United striker Mark Hughes: \"It is an outstanding record and won't be surpassed. It has taken 40-odd years for Sir Bobby's record to be broken which shows how high a mark it was.\"\nWayne's world - the stats\nThis was only Rooney's second Premier League goal of the season after netting on the opening day against Bournemouth.\nOf his 250 Manchester United goals, this was the 11th that had come in the 90th minute or after and the sixth scored from a direct free-kick.\n180 of his goals have come in the Premier League, with 39 in European competition.\n136 have been at home, 106 away and eight at neutral venues.\nHe has scored 193 with his right foot, 27 with his left and 30 with his head.\nUnited frustrated until the last\nRooney's intervention was all the more dramatic given the struggles of his team-mates on a bitter afternoon in the Potteries.\nUnited had almost all of the play - 65% of the possession, 25 efforts on goal to Stoke's six, almost a third of the game was played in City's defensive third - and yet the visitors could barely find a way through.\nSoon after deflecting into his own net, Mata dinked over from close range with the goal at his mercy, while Grant made excellent saves from Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba.\nZlatan Ibrahimovic was strangely subdued and on more than one occasion he opted to pass when an effort on goal looked the better option.\nAn isolated figure in the first half, the former Sweden forward gained more support in the second - Marcus Rashford providing pace and incision down the left, fellow substitute Jesse Lingard hitting the top of the crossbar.\nIt all looked to count for nothing until Rooney's late moment of magic gave the visitors a point they totally deserved.\nTireless Potters remain on the up\nDespite the desperate disappointment of seeing victory snatched away, Stoke can take encouragement from further evidence of continued improvement.\nAs recently as 31 December, a five-game winless run had them only seven points above the relegation zone, but they have since won two and drawn one.\nConceding 32 in their first 19 matches, they have shipped only two in the past three - and on Saturday keeper Grant's brilliance was matched by Bruno Martins Indi, who put in a colossal performance at the heart of defence.\nThough attacks were largely limited to counters, Marko Arnautovic created problems down the left and Peter Crouch was a handful for the United defence, despite playing a lone hand up front.\nA day that began with new signing Saido Berahino being paraded on the pitch ultimately ended with a sucker punch, but realistically Stoke should see this as point gained rather than two dropped.\nMan of the match - Lee Grant (Stoke City)\n'We need to pick ourselves up'\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"We are disappointed but we need to pick ourselves up. We were within seconds of beating a very good Manchester United team.\n\"My only criticism to the guys is that we didn't keep the ball long enough. We are good enough to do that but we needed more care to get up the other end of the pitch.\n\"In the end we tried to protect what we had and I can't criticise what we did for the free kick.\"\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho: \"It was a big game with two teams in the beginning trying to win. But after 25 minutes one team tried to win and the other tried to defend, which they did amazingly well.\n\"They showed great work-rate and did everything to try and stop us. We did everything well except in front of our target.\n\"We missed unbelievable chances. We hit the post, the keeper saves, we missed chances. The opposition goalkeepers are always amazing against us.\"\nWhat's next?\nOut of the FA Cup, Stoke do not play again until 1 February, when they host Everton in the Premier League.\nUnited have two games before then, holding a 2-0 lead when they travel to Hull in the second leg of the EFL Cup semi-final on Thursday and entertaining Wigan in the FA Cup on 29 January (16:00 GMT, live on BBC One)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nSon Heung-Min earned Tottenham a point in controversial circumstances as they came from two goals down to earn a draw at Manchester City.\nPep Guardiola's side, looking to bounce back from a 4-0 loss at Everton, had swept into that commanding advantage courtesy of two uncharacteristic errors from Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris.\nFrance international Lloris headed an attempted clearance straight at Leroy Sane four minutes after half-time to allow the City attacker a simple finish, then dropped Raheem Sterling's routine cross straight at Kevin De Bruyne's feet five minutes later.\nSpurs responded swiftly through Dele Alli's header before they were the beneficiaries of a decision that left Guardiola raging and paved the way for the visitors to scramble a point.\nReferee Andre Marriner ignored Kyle Walker's push on Sterling as he raced into the area - and seconds later Son swept a low finish past City keeper Claudio Bravo with 13 minutes left.\nCity pressed for a winner but were frustrated once more when Brazilian teenager Gabriel Jesus, on as for his debut as a substitute for Sterling, saw an effort ruled out for offside.\nThe result means Man City remain fifth, three points off second-place Tottenham and nine away from leaders Chelsea, who play Hull City on Sunday.\nFrustration and fury for Guardiola\nCity boss Guardiola will have few complaints about the manner of their performance but they were let down by the familiar failing of a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal.\nCity played with verve and intensity as they penned Spurs back, but Sergio Aguero was frustrated on several occasions by Lloris, Pablo Zabaleta shot inches wide, Sterling missed that vital opportunity after he was fouled. New boy Jesus also headed inches wide.\nGuardiola's animated body language spoke of his frustration - but there was also fury at the key incident - Sterling was shoved by Walker in the area seconds before Spurs attacked for Son to equalise.\nHe had every right to be angry. City deserved victory and for all the justified criticism aimed in their direction, there was not too much wrong with this performance.\nA goalkeeper's life...\nManchester City's Bravo provided the pre-match narrative with his growing reputation as the goalkeeper who rarely makes a save - but it was the man regarded as one of Europe's finest who was almost the real villain of the piece here.\nBravo was again the goalkeeping bystander as he extended his miserable recent sequence, but Tottenham's Lloris suffered a rare nightmare display and takes responsibility for both City goals.\nHe should have done better than head a routine long ball against Sane for the opener, while his fumble that led to De Bruyne's second was the sort of work he would normally complete without a second thought.\nBravo was powerless for the Spurs goals - although today's two goals make it 16 from the last 24 attempts on target against him - but Lloris' misfortune was proof of how matches, and the the reputation of even the best goalkeepers, can be decided by the finest margins.\nLloris has saved Spurs on many occasions but today he was saved by his colleagues.\nSpurs dig deep\nMauricio Pochettino's side would not put this display anywhere near the top of any list of their best performances this season - but they may come to regard this as a priceless point earned without playing well.\nSpurs were over-run for much of the game, unsettled in possession by the pressure applied by City, but showed resilience and determination to get a draw they barely deserved.\nThey were also grateful for City's generosity in front of goal as they wasted as succession of chances, and to referee Marriner for refusing what appeared to be a clear penalty when Walker shoved Sterling as he raced clear in what proved to be a decisive moment.\nSpurs' travelling fans celebrated as if this was a victory at the final whistle. Some days you just take the point and get home - to be able to do that at the home of close rivals will make it taste even sweeter.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nManager reaction\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"We played good, it was an outstanding performance but it's a pity what happened. All you can do is create and play better and better but it is the same for the whole season. We are upset, sad at what happened but I am so proud about what we did and the players don't deserve that again.\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told BBC Sport: \"It was a tough game for both sides. It is true, they were better in the first half and maybe deserved more, it was lucky for us to be 0-0 but in the second half the game was more balanced. We conceded two and it was difficult to come back but they always believed, that is important. It's a massive point for us.\nSon prospers away from home\nManchester City failed to win a Premier League game they were two or more goals ahead in for the first time since December 2014 against Burnley.\nSix of Son Heung-min's seven Premier League goals this season have been scored away from home.\nDele Alli has scored more Premier League goals this season (11 in 21 games) than he had in the whole of last season (10 in 33).\nHugo Lloris made two errors leading to goals in the match - the first goalkeeper to do so in a Premier League match since Joel Robles in May 2016.\nWho's next?\nTottenham return to league action on 31 January against Sunderland, after their FA Cup fourth-round tie with Wycombe next Saturday.\nManchester City travel to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup on 28 January before meeting West Ham on 1 February."

        "article_text": "Southampton 3-0 Leicester City\nLeicester City remain winless away from home in the Premier League this season after being completely outclassed by Southampton at St Mary's.\nClaude Puel's hosts, defeated in each of their past four league games, dominated from the first whistle and deservedly went ahead through James Ward-Prowse's first goal in 22 games.\nWard-Prowse's free-kick helped set up the second for Jay Rodriguez, before Dusan Tadic's late penalty set the seal on a one-sided victory.\nChampions Leicester have now gone 11 games without an away league victory this season - having won 11 times on their travels en route to the title. The 37 goals they have conceded in 22 games so far is one more than the total shipped in the whole of last season.\nDefeat leaves Claudio Ranieri's side three places and five points above the relegation zone.\nSouthampton climb to 11th place having comfortably avoided the ignominy of equalling the club's top-flight record of five consecutive defeats, set in 1998.\nAnalysis: How Leicester's defeat shows how a diamond can fail\nRelive the action from St Mary's\nFoxes' title defence goes from bad to worse\nIn the corresponding fixture last season, Southampton also took a 2-0 lead into the break before a Jamie Vardy double saw Leicester to a deserved draw.\nThe point won that day was the seventh the Foxes had earned from a losing position in the first nine games of the season, and was an early clue that they were a little bit special.\n\"We have fantastic spirit,\" Ranieri said after that match. \"We believe everything could be possible.\"\nFast forward to this season and the mood in the Leicester camp could hardly be more contrasting.\nA few darting runs by Demarai Gray aside, Ranieri's men seldom threatened Fraser Forster's goal, and the two goals conceded before the interval did not come close to galvanising the visitors in the way it had 15 months earlier. Tadic's penalty only compounded their misery.\nIf Leicester's season is not to become a battle against relegation, they need to start winning quickly - but their upcoming fixtures are far from encouraging.\nFour of their next six matches are away from home - including the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Sevilla - while their home games in that period are against Manchester United and Liverpool.\nVan Dijk injury sours near-perfect day for Saints\nFrom the moment Ward-Prowse curled a precise finish beyond Kasper Schmeichel from Cedric Soares' low cross, there seemed only one possible outcome.\nBy the break, the visitors had managed just two touches in the Saints area. The hosts had managed 16 in the other penalty box - one of those a rifled left-footed finish by Rodriguez after a Ward-Prowse free-kick was inadvertently helped on by Leicester defender Robert Huth.\nCruising Saints thought they had added a third after the break when Wes Morgan headed into his own net from a free-kick, only for an offside flag to spare the visiting captain.\nBut not for long.\nA few minutes later, Morgan was flummoxed by the pace of Shane Long, who was hauled down in the area. Referee Michael Oliver rightly pointed to the spot.\nUp stepped Tadic to dispatch his first home goal for Southampton in a year.\nThe loss of centre-back Virgil van Dijk to an apparent ankle injury in the second half will be Puel's only regret, especially in the week that the club lost captain Jose Fonte following his move to West Ham.\nAsked about Van Dijk's availability for Wednesday's EFL Cup semi-final against Liverpool, which Saints lead 1-0 after the first leg, Puel said: \"We will see tomorrow and the next day. He is an important player for us and I hope he can recover.\"\nMan of the match - James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)\n'It is my fault' - what the managers said\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"I think it was a good first half and a good game. We had good management and the possibility to finish the game before we did with a lot of chances.\n\"A clean sheet, goals - it is perfect for us. It was important to win after the last four we have lost.\n\"I am pleased to see the players trying to shoot with more responsibility and that Ward-Prowse scored from midfield. That is important and I like this.\"\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It was not a good performance. It is my fault. I wanted to change the shape of my teams in the last two matches.\n\"Against Chelsea, we played three at the back, today a diamond in midfield. Maybe my players didn't understand my idea very well.\n\"It is important to react. I take responsibility. We have to go back with more desire to get the first away win. I know we try to do our best. At the moment, everything is wrong. I am very frustrated.\"\nLeicester equal unwanted record - match stats\nLeicester's haul of 21 points from 22 games is the joint-worst return for a reigning champion in top-flight history (Ipswich in 1962-63, converted to three points for a win).\nSouthampton ended a run of four straight league defeats, picking up their first top-flight win since 18 December (when they beat Bournemouth 3-1).\nSaints scored more than one first-half goal for the first time in the Premier League this season.\nClaudio Ranieri's side have gone 13 away Premier League games without a win, longer than any other side.\nIndeed, it is Leicester's longest winless away streak in the league since 2005 (18 matches).\nJay Rodriguez scored a Premier League goal at St Mary's for the first time since 27 August.\nDusan Tadic registered his first league goal at St Mary's in more than a year, since he scored against West Brom on 16 January, 2016.\nWhat's next?\nIt's a big week for Southampton, who travel to Anfield for the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Wednesday (20:00 GMT), before hosting Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday (17:30). Leicester's next outing is their FA Cup fourth-round tie at Championship side Derby on Friday (19:55)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-1 Burnley\nAlexis Sanchez scored a 98th-minute penalty as 10-man Arsenal recovered from conceding in injury time to claim a thrilling win over Burnley at Emirates Stadium.\nThe Gunners' title chances appeared to have been derailed as substitute Francis Coquelin fouled Ashley Barnes in the 93rd minute and Andre Gray converted from the spot to level after Shkodran Mustafi's header had finally broken Burnley's resistance.\nBut, after Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was sent to the stands for protesting referee Jon Moss' decision, Ben Mee was then penalised for a high foot on Laurent Koscielny in the Burnley area, and Sanchez deceived Clarets keeper Tom Heaton with a Panenka-style penalty.\nThe hosts had dominated for most of the game until Granit Xhaka's second dismissal of the season for a reckless two-footed lunge on Steven Defour, from which Burnley profited, only for Sanchez to claim all three points in impudent fashion.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArsenal's fifth consecutive league victory at home lifts them above Liverpool and Tottenham, who both dropped points on Saturday, but they remain eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who beat Hull 2-0 on Sunday.\nThe result also means Burnley's dismal away record this season continues, with Sean Dyche's side having collected only one point from a possible 30 on the road.\nRelive the frantic finale at Emirates Stadium\nA tale of two penalties\nHeading into the seven minutes of added time, it appeared Arsenal had done enough to repel Burnley despite going down to 10 men, only for Coquelin to make a rash tackle on Barnes, with Moss showing no hesitation in awarding the penalty.\nWenger protested and was sent to the stands but it was a clear trip and Gray converted, despite Petr Cech getting a firm hand on his shot.\nBurnley boss Dyche was similarly aggrieved moments later as Moss penalised Mee for a high foot on Koscielny, who appeared to be offside when the ball was flighted in to the back post, but once that was missed, a penalty was a fair result for the challenge.\nSanchez, who had earlier curled two efforts narrowly over either side of the interval, had one last moment of panache left, coolly chipping his effort straight down the middle as Heaton dived to his right, securing a vital win.\n\"It's a tough day for us in the end. To lose a game in that fashion, with an offside not given, is tough, particularly when you come to tough places like this,\" said Burnley boss Dyche.\n\"We know how tough this division is but you need officials to make the right decisions and that is the shame today. The officials have to be brave at places like this, I understand that, but you've got to think it has to be given.\"\nXhaka sees red... again\nAn entertaining, if slightly routine, game had its complexion changed on 65 minutes when Xhaka's needless challenge on Defour saw him sent off by referee Moss after consultation with the linesman.\nThe 24-year-old's dismissal was his fifth in the league since the start of last season - more than any other player in Europe's top five divisions - and his second of this campaign, having also been sent off by Moss against Swansea in October.\nHis ninth red card in three seasons could have an adverse effect on Arsenal's title hopes with the midfielder now banned for the next four matches, including a crucial Premier League match at Chelsea on 4 February.\nPrior to his reckless tackle, Xhaka displayed his impressive range of passing, releasing the likes of Mesut Ozil and Sanchez from deep and showing why he will be missed.\nXhaka's red also sparked an ill-disciplined end to the game for Arsenal, with Mustafi booked for dissent and Wenger also sent off for a futile protest against Burnley's penalty, for which he later apologised.\n\"I didn't see any penalty from outside but I should have shut up and I apologise, even if I was frustrated,\" said the Arsenal boss once tensions had cooled.\nBurnley's travel sickness continues\nSanchez's late winner provided a sickening end note for Dyche - who was taking charge of his 200th Burnley game - after he had appeared to get his tactics just right for long periods of the game.\nDespite not electing to use a five-man midfield to try and match Arsenal, his side were disciplined in staying behind the ball to force the hosts into attempting increasingly elaborate ways of opening them up, while the pace of Gray kept Mustafi and Koscielny honest on the break.\nThe nature of Arsenal's opener will therefore irk Dyche, as Mustafi was easily able to free himself of the Burnley defence's attention to apply a simple finish to Ozil's corner, with no-one stationed on the back post.\nWith Arsenal down to 10 men, Dyche sent on Joey Barton and Sam Vokes and though Cech was rarely called into action, they applied enough pressure to induce a mistake as Gray scored the equaliser Burnley perhaps deserved.\nYet once again, they could not hold firm to secure a positive result on the road, falling to their ninth defeat in 10 away games this season.\nThe Clarets have secured 25 points at Turf Moor this year, just one less than Arsenal at the Emirates, but are bottom of the Premier League away table with a solitary point.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"We finally got the win but of course it was very difficult for us. We couldn't get the second goal, we played with 10 men and they played well as well. In the end we got the three points we wanted.\n\"Burnley are well organised, they make the game simple but efficient. We won there in the last second and we one again in the last second today.\n\"Every week and every game is an unbelievable fight for everybody.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"To be fair to Arsenal they still attempted to come at us, but then they retreated in numbers, so we got bodies forward and made them uncomfortable and it paid off in the end with a penalty that was a penalty.\n\"Then after that you're thinking their chance may be something like a corner or a set-piece and it's just unfortunate.\n\"My players are doing the right thing, clearing box and catching him offside, it is offside and it's not given.\"\nArsenal leave it late against Burnley again\nArsenal have scored a 90th-minute winner in both of their Premier League games against Burnley this season. The only other time this has happened in the competition was Manchester United against Manchester City in 2009-10.\nAlexis Sanchez took his third ever Premier League penalty, but this was his first successful one.\nSince the start of last season, Granit Xhaka has been shown more red cards than any other player in the big five European leagues (5).\nArsenal have conceded seven penalty goals this season - more than they have in any other Premier League campaign.\nThe last time there were two 90th-minute penalties scored in the same Premier League match was in April 2011 - Arsenal v Liverpool at the Emirates.\nArsenal are the only side to have won (31) more games than they've lost (26) when having a player sent off in the Premier League.\nWhat's next?\nArsenal travel to Southampton in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday (17:30 GMT), before hosting Watford in the Premier League on 31 January (19:45 GMT). Burnley host Bristol City in their FA Cup fourth round tie, also on Saturday (15:00 GMT), before facing Leicester at Turf Moor in the league three days later (19:45 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-0 Hull City\nDiego Costa scored on his return to the Chelsea team as they beat Hull City to move eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.\nThe Spain striker missed last weekend's 3-0 win over champions Leicester, citing a back injury after a disagreement with a fitness coach, amid reports of Chinese Super League interest.\nBut the Blues' top scorer - cheered throughout the game by home fans - returned against struggling Hull and had an early impact, sending an effort from 20 yards fizzing just wide after only 10 seconds.\nHe got the opening goal when he converted Victor Moses' low cross from eight yards out in the seventh minute of first-half injury time.\nThe long stoppage was a result of an injury to Hull midfielder Ryan Mason, who went to hospital after being carried off on a stretcher wearing an oxygen mask following a clash of heads with Chelsea defender Gary Cahill. Hull later announced he had fractured his skull.\nThe Tigers played well but lacked cutting edge without the injured Robert Snodgrass and Cahill sealed the win when he headed home Cesc Fabregas' free-kick.\nCosta-inspired Chelsea control the title race\nLast weekend, Chelsea's position at the top of the Premier League was looking far from secure. The Blues were five points clear after their long winning run was ended by Tottenham and Costa's future at the club seemed in severe doubt.\nFast forward eight days and the Blues - with Costa back in the first team - are now eight points above second-placed Arsenal, the only other team in the top six to win this weekend.\nAntonio Conte's side were far from spectacular against the Tigers. In fact, Costa - with six shots - was the only Chelsea player to have more than one effort.\nBut a 15th win in their past 16 league games - and a 13th Premier League clean sheet of the season - takes them one game closer to a sixth English top-flight title.\nThe omens look good for Chelsea. No team have ever failed to win the Premier League title after picking up 55 points or more in their opening 22 games.\nCosta speculation is finished - Conte\nListen: 5 live Football Daily - 'If Chelsea beat Arsenal & Liverpool, title is theirs'\nSnodgrass-less Hull need new signings\nHull City have shown signs of improvement after sacking manager Mike Phelan and replacing him with Marco Silva. After beating Bournemouth in his opening Premier League game, they gave Chelsea a real match for large periods.\nWhether they stay up - they are two points adrift of safety - might rely on Silva's transfer actions in the next nine days.\nThey left out West Ham target Robert Snodgrass, who has scored or assisted 50% of their league goals this season - and Silva said just before the game it was \"impossible for him to stay\".\nDespite a good performance, they lacked incision without the Scotland international. A majority of their nine shots came from distance, with centre-back Harry Maguire having four efforts.\nAt 1-0, they could have had a penalty when Marcos Alonso kicked the back of Abel Hernandez's foot, but nothing was awarded.\nThree of Silva's signings, Omar Elabdellaoui, Evandro and Oumar Niasse, played but the Portuguese wants more new faces - and he needs them after selling midfielder Jake Livermore to West Brom for \u00a310m and the loss of Mason to injury.\nHowever, whether anyone can make up for the apparently imminent loss of Snodgrass - their only player to score more than three Premier League goals this season - remains to be seen.\nMan of the match - Harry Maguire (Hull City)\nManager reaction - 'Not easy to play this type of game'\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte told BBC Sport: \"This game was very difficult for us.\n\"It is not easy to play this type of game. I think our opponent played very good, had good organisation and made it difficult for us.\n\"We are in the second part of the season and every game is now very tough for us and also for the other teams.\n\"You can see today the difficulty all of the teams have.\"\nHull City manager Marco Silva: \"It was not what we wanted from the game. We came here to compete, to take points. Chelsea are in a very good moment but we try.\n\"In some moments we controlled the game. Chelsea had more ball possession but our team tried and conceded in the last minute of the first half which was cheap. If we changed some things the result might have been different.\n\"It was a good performance but I want more.\"\nMatch stats - Costa scores the latest first-half goal\nOnly Ryan Giggs (162) and Frank Lampard (102) have provided more Premier League assists than Cesc Fabregas (101, same as Wayne Rooney).\nIn his 100th Chelsea game, Diego Costa scored his 52nd goal for the club.\nCosta's strike was the latest first-half goal in the Premier League since exact times have been recorded by Opta (2006-07 - 51:35).\nThe Spain striker has scored in all four of his Premier League games against Hull City.\nThis is the fourth time a team have had 55 or more points after 22 Premier League games - and Chelsea have now done so three times (also 2004-05 and 2005-06).\nHull have now gone 20 Premier League games without a clean sheet since beating Swansea 2-0 back in August.\nThe Blues have now won 1,002 Premier League points at home, becoming the third club to reach four figures in the competition (Manchester United 1,116 and Arsenal 1,019).\nAntonio Conte has the same number of points from his first 22 Premier League games that Jose Mourinho had in his (55).\nWhat's next?\nChelsea host London neighbours Brentford in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday (15:00 GMT kick-off), and visit Liverpool - 10 points behind them - in the Premier League on 31 January (20:00).\nHull host Manchester United in the EFL Cup semi-final second leg on Thursday (19:45), having lost the first game 2-0.

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-2 Crystal Palace\nCrystal Palace finally earned a Premier League victory under Sam Allardyce as goals by Scott Dann and Christian Benteke secured the points against Bournemouth at a rain-swept Vitality Stadium.\nAfter a goalless first half, Dann broke the deadlock shortly after the restart from Damien Delaney's flick-on to set Allardyce on his way to a first league win as Eagles boss at the sixth attempt.\nBenteke added a second in the closing moments, heading home a pinpoint cross by Andros Townsend, who before kick-off had been strongly linked with a deadline-day move back to Newcastle.\nPalace will also take heart from a first away clean sheet in the Premier League since Boxing Day 2015, although the hosts were unlucky to draw a blank with Joshua King and Junior Stanislas both seeing well-hit efforts deflect narrowly wide.\nPalace had only earned two points from the last available 24 before this result and remain inside the relegation zone, two points behind Swansea.\nThe result also brings the relegation dogfight a little closer to Bournemouth's door. Eddie Howe's side drop to 14th place and are now seven points above the drop zone after a run of just one win in seven.\nPalace set to sign Sakho on loan\nReaction to all of Tuesday's Premier League matches\nPalace finally shore up at the back\nFormer England boss Allardyce has built his reputation on teams that are hard to break down, so improving Palace's defensive solidity has been a priority since his arrival at Selhurst Park in December.\nThe defensive frailties that long pre-dated his arrival have taken time to put right, but this match suggested Allardyce's methods are finally having an impact.\nThe back three of Dann, Delaney and James Tomkins looked solid throughout, while the protection in front of the defence provided by Yohan Cabaye and James McArthur was tigerish and tireless.\n\"The key today was keeping Bournemouth in front of us,\" said Allardyce. \"We've let too many people get through us and behind us recently and we had to stop that. I think Bournemouth found that frustrating.\n\"It's a great result. It's a first clean sheet, hopefully of many. It's three massive points away from home. I'm so pleased about the 'nil'.\n\"The players today looked like what I would expect a team of mine to look like.\"\nBournemouth's slump continues\nIt's been a worrying winter for Bournemouth, who are now winless in their last four home league games and continuing to ship goals at an alarming rate.\nThey have now conceded 28 in 12 games in all competitions, although manager Eddie Howe felt his side did enough to contain Palace and was more upset with their failure to ask more of the visitors' defence.\n\"We had a lot of the ball tonight but didn't do enough with it - there were a lot of sideways and backward passes, which when you're not feeling good about yourself is the easiest thing to do,\" said Howe.\nThe hosts managed just two shots on target, but on another night could easily have made a breakthrough, with Stanislas in particular very unlucky to see his first-half shot whistle a whisker past the post after catching the heel of Dann.\nAnd the final result might have been very different had Jack Wilshere's well-struck last-minute free-kick not been met with an equally good save by Wayne Hennessey at full stretch.\nWithin moments, a loose pass out of Bournemouth's defence by Simon Francis was seized upon by Townsend, who advanced and sent over a perfect cross for Benteke to complete the victory.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\nMatch of the Day analysis\nFormer England winger Trevor Sinclair: \"It was a much-needed win for Palace. It was a brave performance and sometimes it helps being away from home. They had a game plan, which was to get ball wide, and that helps when they have got players like Townsend and Zaha. Everything that Sam Allardyce asked them to do they executed.\n\"Bournemouth are conceding a lot of goals and it is worrying. For the second goal particularly it was poor defending and poor decision-making.\"\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy: \"It is as well as they have played under him. They have started to do the things you expect a Big Sam side to do.\n\"Even though they are in the bottom three, you expect they have enough.\"\nDangerous Dann delivers again - match stats\nSince the start of last season, Scott Dann has scored more Premier League goals than any other defender in the division (8).\nOnly Christian Benteke (9) has scored more league goals for Palace than Dann since 2015-16.\nThe Eagles have earned a higher percentage of their points on the road than any other side in Premier League history (48.73%).\nAfter winning two of their first three away league games this season, that was the Eagles' first away win in nine Premier League matches.\nIt was the first time Palace had won a Premier League away game by more than one goal since August 2015 (3-1 vs Norwich).\n'They executed the game plan brilliantly'\nPalace boss Sam Allardyce: \"It's relief for me. It [the first league victory victory] really should have happened in the first game at Watford and it's been a long haul since.\n\"You can't argue with the result with the amount of chances we created. They executed the game plan brilliantly today.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I thought we played with a lack of confidence today. We didn't hurt them enough. They got a lot of men behind the ball and it's up to us to find a way through.\n\"We didn't play well but we didn't look like we were going to concede. I don't think our problem was defensively today.\n\"Usually at home we have a spring in our step but that wasn't there today and that's concerning.\n\"We had some very good chances we didn't take, even though we played poorly.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth these sides are back in Premier League action at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, when Bournemouth are the visitors to Goodison Park to face Everton and Crystal Palace entertain Sunderland in a crucial relegation meeting."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-2 Watford\nArsenal's Premier League title hopes suffered a huge blow with a shock home defeat as Watford secured their first top-flight win over the Gunners since 1988.\nFormer Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul lashed in the opener within 10 minutes for Watford with a shot from outside the area which deflected off Aaron Ramsey.\nJust two minutes and 57 seconds later, the visitors doubled their lead as Troy Deeney tapped in the rebound after Etienne Capoue's fine run ended with his shot being saved by Petr Cech.\nThe Arsenal goalkeeper was called into action again as he tipped Sebastian Prodl's header over the crossbar and pushed away Daryl Janmaat's curling strike.\nThe hosts improved significantly in the second half and Alex Iwobi pulled a goal back by steering Alexis Sanchez's cross home.\nLucas Perez struck the crossbar with a powerful drive, but they could not find the equaliser.\nRelive Watford's win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium\nChallenge over for another year?\nArsenal last won the title in the 2003-04 season and face clawing back a nine-point deficit on London rivals and leaders Chelsea, who drew 1-1 with Liverpool.\nAnd their task is made more difficult as they still face trips to play Antonio Conte's side as well as Liverpool and Tottenham - the other three teams in the top four - between now and the end of the season.\nGoing into this game they were unbeaten in their last five league fixtures, but a desperately poor first half showing - with manager Arsene Wenger watching powerless from the stands as he served the second of a four-match touchline ban - cost them dearly.\nThe Gunners failed to get a shot on target in the first 45 minutes, but forced Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes into sharp saves from substitute Theo Walcott and Iwobi after the break, while the Brazilian pushed away Mesut Ozil's snap shot.\nBut they suffered their first defeat at the Emirates Stadium since the opening day against Liverpool, ending a run of eight victories and two draws.\nStung by the Hornets\nWatford boss Walter Mazzarri was under increasing pressure after an embarrassing FA Cup exit at Millwall and seven games without a win in the league.\nBut the visitors' energetic start - pressing Arsenal high up the pitch and not allowing the hosts time on the ball - created the platform for them to climb to 13th in the table, eight points clear of the relegation zone.\nCentral midfielder Capoue produced a dynamic performance. He contributed seven tackles and won the ball back the same number of times to top his team's defensive statistics and lay the groundwork for Watford's first league win over Arsenal in nearly 30 years.\nDebutant M'Baye Niang, signed on loan from AC Milan until the end of the season, showcased his pace in the 70 minutes he was on the pitch and his strong running down the left caused Arsenal right-back Gabriel constant problems.\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue (Watford)\n'You have to press them'\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was obvious we lost duels and were not sharp enough. It looked more mentally that we were not ready for the challenges. We were unlucky for the first goal which was deflected after a soft free-kick.\n\"It took us a while to get into the game; it was all us in the second half and we were unlucky not to get something from the game.\"\nWatford boss Walter Mazzarri: \"We played a great first half and the condition of some of the players is returning. In the second half, Arsenal managed to press us but in general it was very well done.\n\"Against a great team in their stadium, you cannot allow them to play too much of the ball and you have to press them. We did that very well but you cannot do it for 90 minutes. That was our tactic.\"\nAnalysis - Arsenal are nowhere near Chelsea\nMatch of the Day pundit Danny Murphy\n\"I have to give Watford credit because they had not won in seven games but did not look like a side lacking confidence. They had a good game plan and looked a threat on the break.\n\"I was a bit surprised by Arsenal. You can't start games like they did today. It was lethargic, sloppy and they did not look like a team going for the title. For the first 25 minutes they were lucky to be only 2-0 down. Watford were the first to every ball.\n\"Capoue was a driving force throughout the game. He had a great start to the season and faded but he was back to his best today. His performance was superb.\n\"Arsenal played better in the second half but you can't keep giving yourself a mountain to climb against such quality and expect to win games. You are never going to win the league that way. Defensively, even though they brought in reinforcements, I still don't think they are anywhere near Chelsea.\"\nWhat next?\nArsenal face a crucial trip to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday (kick-off 12:30 GMT), while Watford host Burnley the same day at 15:00 GMT.\nSanchez would love to play Watford every week - the stats\nWatford earned their first league win against Arsenal since April 1988, ending a run of seven straight defeats against them.\nYounes Kaboul has scored more Premier League goals against Arsenal than he has against any other side (3).\nThe Gunners had not conceded a goal in the opening 15 minutes of their last 53 home Premier League games before tonight.\nAlexis Sanchez has had a hand in six Premier League goals against Watford (three goals, three assists). He has not been involved in more against any other club.\nThe Hornets ended a run of seven Premier League games without victory (drawn three, lost four), since beating Everton in December.\nIt was their first away league win since October, when they beat Middlesbrough 1-0.\nDespite having twice as many shots in total as Watford (20-10), Arsenal had one shot on target fewer than the Hornets (5-6)."

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-0 Leicester City\nBurnley secured their fifth consecutive home Premier League win with victory over Leicester at Turf Moor, thanks to Sam Vokes' late goal.\nThe Clarets dominated for long spells but routinely failed to hit the target until substitute Vokes hooked in Michael Keane's knock-down from a corner in the 87th minute.\nThe ball hit Vokes' hand before he turned to score but referee Mike Dean dismissed Leicester's appeals for the goal to be disallowed.\nClaudio Ranieri's side remain without an away Premier League win this season - they also failed to score for a fourth consecutive league game.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Foxes now have the worst record after 23 games by a reigning top-flight title-winning club, eclipsing the Ipswich side of 1962-63.\nBurnley's first victory over Leicester since August 2010 also means Sean Dyche's side have won a fifth straight home top-flight game for the first time since 1966.\nBurnley edging home and dry\nBurnley showed once again why they are imposing hosts, with Arsenal's defeat to Watford ensuring the Clarets now have the third-best home record in the Premier League behind Chelsea and Tottenham as they moved ninth overall.\nAlthough their away form remains poor - like Leicester they are yet to win on the road this season - their combination of defensive solidity and the attacking options provided by Andre Gray, Ashley Barnes and Vokes at home could steer them to guaranteed safety this season before long.\nThey had luck on their side here too, with Dean and his assistants ruling that Vokes did not intentionally handle the ball as Keane's header fell to him, a decision that will continue to incense Leicester.\nYet in truth, the Clarets should not have had to rely on such a scrappy goal. They were profligate in front of the net, with only three shots on target out of 24 as Gray drew two solid saves from Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel.\nRecord-signing Robbie Brady was unveiled to the home crowd at half-time, with Ashley Westwood also arriving on a busy transfer deadline day for Dyche's side, who now look to have the strength in depth to ensure their survival.\nFaded Foxes remain tame tourists\nLeicester have now suffered three straight Premier League defeats for the first time under Ranieri, marking the lowest ebb of the Italian's reign.\nThe outline of that thrilling title-winning team remains, with Riyad Mahrez looking bright at times on his first start since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations and Jamie Vardy's pace causing Burnley problems. But too often they are simply chasing shadows.\nIn the 21st minute, Vardy raced onto Matthew Lowton's loose back-pass only to fire a dreadful effort off at a right-angle and out for a throw-in, while Robert Huth and Wes Morgan were menaced by Burnley striker Gray. That wastefulness and defensive frailty were not evident last year.\nA 2-0 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in April during that dizzying run to the title was the last time Leicester won away in the Premier League, in a season where they topped both the home and away tables.\nThe Foxes are now firmly at the other end, just two points above the relegation zone and desperately looking for answers, with Leonardo Ulloa's dispute with Ranieri perhaps hinting at further problems behind the scenes.\nDean in the spotlight again\nRightly or wrongly, much of the discussion of this game will again centre on the performance of referee Dean, in particular his decision to allow Vokes' late winner to stand.\nThe ball undoubtedly struck the Wales striker's hand, but Dean either did not see it or adjudged Vokes' movement towards the ball not to be intentional.\n\"It was a handball - it was for everybody, for the television, but not for the referee,\" said Ranieri.\nAlthough the most significant moment, that late decision will not be the only one debated.\nDean, who has awarded the most penalties of any referee this season, judged that Burnley keeper Tom Heaton did not foul Vardy in the area on either of their two collisions.\nBurnley will feel they also deserved a penalty before the break for a push by Danny Drinkwater on Keane, but Dyche was unwilling to dwell on Dean afterwards.\n\"If we did get a scratch of luck people wouldn't say it was underserved as we've had a few things go against us this season,\" said Dyche.\nMan of the match - Joey Barton (Burnley)\n'It was a good goal to win it' - manager reaction\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche said: \"I'm very pleased and we deserved it - we were constantly knocking on the door against a good side.\n\"We finally broke them down and scored a good goal to win it - I think it comes off Sam Vokes' stomach first then his hand but you could suggest we could've had a penalty - there was a nudge in Michael Keane's back.\n\"We want Ashley Westwood and Robbie Brady to add to the quality of the team, we just wanted to bolster the group, while Joey Barton is applying himself well, as he always has done at this club.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri said: \"The referee is the boss, he didn't see it and we lost - in this moment everything is wrong against us, including the decision of the referee.\n\"We have a problem scoring goals and we conceded a goal and we have to react.\n\"Our target from the beginning is 40 points and we have to fight from this point.\"\nFaltering Foxes - match stats\nBurnley have now won nine Premier League games in 2016/17, their most in a single season in the competition (previous best was seven in 2009/10).\nLeicester have taken just 21 points from 23 games this season; the worst ever total at this stage of a campaign by a reigning top-flight title-winning club.\nLeicester have failed to score in four consecutive league games for the first time since November 2014 (five, under Nigel Pearson).\nBurnley fired in 24 shots (including blocks) against Leicester; their most ever in a Premier League game.\nDespite that, they had just three on target, with the first of those arriving in the 53rd minute.\nJoey Barton made his first Premier League start since May 2015 (also against Leicester, for QPR) - 618 days ago.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to face Watford at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, while Leicester host Manchester United at the King Power stadium on Sunday, with kick-off at 16:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Middlesbrough 1-1 West Bromwich Albion\nMiddlesbrough came back from a goal down but were left frustrated as a resilient West Brom claimed a point at the Riverside Stadium.\nThe in-form Baggies started the game stronger and took the lead from their first attack as James Morrison fired home from long range after the home side had failed to clear a free-kick.\nBut Boro levelled soon after through Alvaro Negredo's penalty after the Spain striker had been fouled in the box by Gareth McAuley.\nFrom that point on, Aitor Karanka's side looked the more likely to win the game, although West Brom hit the woodwork three times through Craig Dawson's header and, in the same attack, a Matt Phillips header and Salomon Rondon shot.\nThe two dropped points were made even worse for Middlesbrough by wins for relegation rivals Swansea and Crystal Palace.\nThe results leave Boro, who are now without a win in six Premier League games, just two points above the bottom three.\nWest Brom, who had the chances to claim three points themselves, stay eighth, but have missed out on the chance to put pressure on Everton above them.\nRelive Tuesday's Premier League fixtures\nTransfer deadline day - live\nWasted chance for frustrated Karanka\nThe result will only add to the seemingly ever-increasing frustration of Middlesbrough boss Karanka.\nThe Spaniard, who missed a game last season amid reports he was considering his position before returning to lead the club to promotion, has been critical of both their fans and board in recent weeks.\nClearly unhappy at the lack of transfer activity this window, Karanka's point was somewhat made for him by a display that highlighted just where the weaknesses lie.\nThey are strong at the back, industrious in the centre of midfield and have a source of chances out wide in Adama Traore - but they remain the division's lowest-scoring side with 18.\nNegredo now has six of those after his penalty, but they do not have another natural goalscorer in their side.\nFor all their possession - 62% of it in the match - the biggest tests Albion keeper Ben Foster faced was to tip away goal-bound attempted clearances from two of his own players, Allan Nyom and Darren Fletcher.\nFor the second game running, Karanka sent on new attacking signings Rudy Gestede and Patrick Bamford, but neither were able to affect the game.\nPoor finishing costs Baggies\nWith 19 senior players at his disposal, Tony Pulis has a legitimate claim to the most threadbare squad in the top flight.\nIt is no surprise that speculation linked the Baggies with a striker during the closing stages of the transfer window as they lack a proven, game-changing attacking option if Matt Phillips and Salomon Rondon have an off day, which was the case on Tuesday.\nThings were looking good after Fletcher teed up Morrison to fire them ahead, but after Boro's equaliser the game could have gone either way - but the fact the visitors did not win was largely down to poor finishing.\nDawson capitalised further on Boro's vulnerability at set-pieces to place a header too close to Valdes, who palmed the effort on to the post.\nIn one extraordinary moment, an unmarked Phillips stooped low to head a cross against the base of the post before Rondon fired the follow-up against the other upright and wide.\nAnalysis\nFormer England winger Trevor Sinclair on Match of the Day:\n\"It is a definite penalty. Negredo uses his body well, he's clever by stepping across the ball. McAuley goes genuinely for ball but his foot is too high and he takes the man out.\"\nMan of the match - Adama Traore (Middlesbrough)\nBaggies unbeaten in five at Boro - match stats\nMiddlesbrough have now drawn nine Premier League games this term, the most of any team in the division\nThe Baggies are unbeaten in their past five trips to Middlesbrough, drawing three, after a run of 18 games without a win there in all competitions.\nAlvaro Negredo is the first Middlesbrough player to have been involved in 10 goals in a Premier League season since Tuncay Sanli (11) in 2008-09.\nWest Brom conceded in their 11th consecutive away league game, their longest run since March 2014 (also 11).\nJames Morrison netted his fourth Premier League goal of the season, his best return since 2012-13, when he scored five.\nAdam Clayton created four chances in this game - no Middlesbrough player has created more in a Premier League game this season.\nWhat they said...\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"It was a good point. We had chances to score and have conceded a goal in a way we knew. It is frustrating.\n\"West Brom are a strong team and we played with everything. I am proud of the players. As a coach, they have done everything.\n\"We had the game under control against a strong team. A point is fair for everybody. The opponent have a lot of experience and good players. Sometimes you can't stop them.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"The penalty changed the course of the first half. We were comfortable and had chances to get a second.\n\"I don't think it is a penalty. Negredo is a big lad and puts himself about. He drops his body in the way of Gareth McAuley. The ref has to be 110% certain to give it. It knocked us. Boro came into it.\n\"Second half we create enough chances to win the game. It wasn't going to be our night.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Brom host Stoke at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, while Middlesbrough travel to second-placed Tottenham the same day for a 17:30 kick-off."

Sigurdsson made the opener, had a long-range effort held by Fraser Forster and a good drive tipped over before the break.\nWhen his moment arrived, he coolly steered in the ball as new boy Narsingh showed rapid pace to lead a break and deliver a cross.\nNews of forward Jordan Ayew joining from Aston Villa, who will take Swans defender Neil Taylor in return, will offer further attacking options.\nBut new recruits will need to go some way to become more important than Sigurdsson. He has now either scored or created half of Swansea's goals this season and Clement will be desperate for more of the same.\nKudos for Clement and Gylfi\nFormer England winger Trevor Sinclair on Match of the Day: \"I think Paul Clement has learnt from his mistakes when he was at Derby. He seems to have got the chemistry right and it is showing in Swansea's performances.\"\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy: \"I am surprised Tottenham let Sigurdsson go. He loves scoring goals; he is technically superb. Without him they would be in a world of trouble.\"\nPatched-up Saints need reinforcements\nPoor league form, excellent EFL Cup form - Southampton pose questions for Puel, who admitted his side did not do enough in the first half to merit more on the night.\nLong was wayward when sent racing into the area early on but their first-half highlights ended there, as they seemed to play in flurries throughout the 90 minutes - a trait that has run through much of their season.\nBefore kick-off, no Premier League side had more players injured than Saints, a predicament that had seen Puel rest 10 players in the 5-0 FA Cup loss against Arsenal at the weekend.\nBut there were still positives for his patched-up side. Romeu was destructive and classy in midfield - completing 92% of his passes - and Long's goal arrived from a fine move as Steven Davis slipped Bertrand clear to pick out a cross.\nNathan Redmond fired wide when well placed and saw Lukasz Fabianski tip another shot over - but two shots on target from 10 efforts perhaps shows why Puel has signed Manolo Gabbiadini from Napoli.\nSaints have scored only 23 league goals all season, so the \u00a314m signing could be a huge help, as would the return of several players from the treatment room.\nMan of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson\n'A massive win' - what the managers said\nSwansea boss Paul Clement: \"A massive result for us - to back the great away win at Liverpool with a home win in a really hard game. They peppered our box with crosses. We showed big character. Our second goal was fantastic, a great counter. We have done more than I expected. Since the heavy loss to Arsenal we have taken one or two really important games.\"\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"A good second half but perhaps it was too late. We cannot take a positive when you lose a game. It was not sufficient for us in the same half without a good concentration and application of our football. The second half was a good reaction, a good try, but they played clinically tonight and have been rewarded.\"\nClean sheets lacking - the stats you need to know...\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in 14 Premier League goals this season (seven goals, seven assists) equalling his tally for last season.\nThe Swans have only kept one clean sheet in their past 14 Premier League games, conceding 37 goals.\nSouthampton have kept just one clean sheet in their past eight away Premier League games.\nUp next?\nSwansea host Manchester City for a lunchtime kick-off on Sunday, while Southampton entertain West Ham on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

The Ivory Coast defender made 15 clearances in total, more than any other player.\nMan of the match - Didier Ndong\n\"We missed two points\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We are disappointed because I think we missed two points.\n\"In the first half it was difficult for us to create chances, which was strange, but in the second half we played better and we had the chances to win the game.\n\"It was not a good night for us but it is a good thing for us to learn that we need to play from the beginning of the game with the same aggression and attitude we showed in the second half.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"It was a really good point for us. We played against a top team and it was tough. We had to hang in there.\n\"We made some chances in the first half but not many in the second, and it was a hard-worked and well-earned point.\n\"Their pressure in the second half was hard to contain and the boys did a great job. They gave everything to get us a result.\"\nMOTD analysis\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy: \"Tottenham are on a par with Chelsea in terms of their defence but I look at their bench and I don't see enough game changers there.\n\"Chelsea can bring Pedro on Liverpool can bring Sturridge on and I look at Tottenham's bench and I just wonder if they have enough.\"\nFormer England winger Trevor Sinclair: \"It was shocking challenge by Jack Rodwell on Moussa Dembele.\n\"We don't want to see this in the game, especially from a player who has had injury problems himself.\n\"He just swipes at Dembele, it is a shocking challenge - he's nowhere near the ball. That could be a leg breaker. It warranted a red card for me.\"\nSpurs usually score - and Sunderland rarely keep a clean sheet\nSunderland kept only their third kept clean sheet of the season, with all three clean sheets coming at the Stadium of Light.\nMeanwhile, Spurs failed to score for only the third time all season in the Premier League.\nThe Black Cats had only three shots all match - their joint-lowest total in a home Premier League game this season (along with Arsenal in October).\nMauricio Pochettino has drawn four of his five visits to the Stadium of Light in the Premier League (W1).\nOnly Chelsea (13) have kept more clean sheets than Spurs (10) in the Premier League this season.\nJack Rodwell is still yet to win a Premier League game he has started for Sunderland (D17 L20).\nWhat next?\nTottenham are at home to Middlesbrough in the evening kick-off on Saturday (17:30 GMT).

This team is outstanding in attitude so let's do the best we can and see where we end up at the end of the season.

We saw a different game to when we played Liverpool and lost at home.\n\"It's pity Diego Costa missed the penalty because he played very well.

        "article_text": "West Ham United 0-4 Manchester City\nGabriel Jesus scored his first Manchester City goal as they tore West Ham apart at London Stadium.\nCity, who left striker Sergio Aguero and goalkeeper Claudio Bravo on the bench, led when Kevin de Bruyne played a one-two with Jesus before stroking home.\nFour minutes later, they doubled their lead when the impressive Leroy Sane beat two defenders and his deflected cross was tapped home by David Silva.\nAnd the game was as good as won before half-time when Raheem Sterling squared the ball to Jesus to tap home.\nYaya Toure added a fourth after the break from a penalty when Hammers debutant Jose Fonte brought down Sterling.\nSigning Jesus like buying a watermelon, says Guardiola\nWest Ham, who made errors to lose possession for each of City's three first-half goals, have been beaten heavily by City twice at home in 2017, having lost 5-0 in their FA Cup meeting last month.\nCity are now only behind fourth-placed Liverpool on goal difference, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea.\nSergio who? City's front three shine\nCity boss Pep Guardiola revealed before the game that he had decided to stick with goalkeeper Willy Caballero and his front three of Sterling, Sane and Jesus - all of whom started Saturday's 3-0 win over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup.\nAnd it worked in sensational style the trio - aged 22, 21 and 19 respectively - ripped the Hammers to shreds.\nJesus, making his first Premier League start following his \u00a327m move from Palmeiras this month, assisted the opener as City broke from their own half at speed with De Bruyne. The Brazilian exchanged passes before the Belgian, who was also impressive throughout, guided the ball past Darren Randolph.\nThe second goal was made by Sane, who has recently hit form following a slow start after his \u00a337m summer move from Schalke, with the German skinning two Hammers defenders and crossing, via a touch from Randolph, for Silva to tap home.\nThe dynamic front three all had a hand in the third, with Sane playing in Sterling, who passed the ball across goal for a Jesus tap-in.\nTheir second-half performance was still dominant albeit less sensational, perhaps because it did not need to be, but they got their fourth when Sterling was brought down by Fonte and Toure narrowly beat Randolph.\nIn goal, Caballero kept his third clean sheet of 2017, having only played three matches, in contrast to the benched Bravo, who had conceded the last six shots on target he had faced.\nHammers hammered again\nWest Ham have now conceded 12 goals to City this season, including nine in 2017 - all at London Stadium.\nAnd while City were brilliant, the Hammers played a huge part in their own downfall.\nAaron Cresswell gifted the ball to City for their first, then lost a 50-50 before the second goal and Pedro Obiang gave the ball to Sane for the third. Centre-back Fonte marked his debut, following his \u00a38m move from Southampton, by conceding a penalty for Toure's second-half penalty.\nThey only forced Caballero to save the ball once - a simple fourth-minute stop from Michail Antonio.\nSlaven Bilic's side - who only had 30% possession - did have the ball in the net once, although Antonio was offside when he latched on to debutant Robert Snodgrass's through ball to fire home.\nMan of the match - Gabriel Jesus (Man City)\nManager reaction - 'Jesus is a fighter'\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola to BBC Sport: \"Our high pressing was good. We were so aggressive without the ball.\n\"Gabriel Jesus is a fighter with instinct for the goal. He's good at assists too.\n\"We played a front three with an average age of 20. I like the fans to be excited. Those players are the future of the club. Leroy Sane had some problems at the beginning but now he's settled. They will be important players for the next few years.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport: \"It's like a copy and paste from the FA Cup game. It's very frustrating. We made such mistakes for the first and third goal. If you give the ball away in those areas, they'll punish you.\n\"When it's 3-0, it's hard to play against them. You are hoping if you score you can turn a game around. But at 3-0 it's more likely you'll concede more as they'll gain confidence.\n\"It's a heavy defeat for us but we can't let it hurt us a lot. We have to bounce back like we did after the FA Cup defeat.\"\nAnalysis - 'City will be found out'\nFormer Chelsea and Everton winger Pat Nevin, BBC Radio 5 live\n\"I think if Manchester City play the team they did tonight away from home against other team, they will be found out.\n\"They are far too open. Yaya Toure, as the holding midfielder, won't get around enough against decent teams.\n\"West Ham are the perfect team for Manchester City. They played 4-4-2 and were destroyed in midfield.\n\"Tactically it was a mess.\"\nMatch stats - Toure maintains perfect record\nGabriel Jesus became the first player to both score and assist a goal on their first Premier League start for Manchester City.\nJesus also became the second youngest Brazilian player to score his first Premier League goal (19yrs 304days), after Rafael for Manchester United in November 2008 (18yrs 122days).\nDavid Silva scored his third away Premier League goal against West Ham - his highest tally of away goals against another opponent in the competition.\nWest Ham have shipped four or more goals in three of their 12 Premier League games at London Stadium - the same number as in their final 106 top-flight games at Upton Park.\nYaya Toure has scored all 11 of his Premier League penalties - the best 100% record in the competition.\nIn his 50th Premier League game, Kevin de Bruyne recorded his 30th goal involvement in the competition (11 goals, 19 assists).\nCity have scored nine goals in two games in all competitions at London Stadium - just half the number West Ham have (18) in 17 games there.\nWhat's next?\nBoth clubs are back in Premier League action this weekend.\nCity host Swansea on Sunday (13:30 GMT), while the Hammers go to Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\nHow the papers saw Jesus' performance"

The Swede said: \"I did not see any chances where it was difficult for the goalkeeper. It was not a good save from Mata, it was a bad finish. Some saves he made for the cameras.\"\nMissed opportunity for Mourinho's men\nUnited had seen all the top four sides drop points in this round of fixtures as they chase a Champions League spot, but failed to capitalise even though they had 66% possession in the match.\nDespite extending their run to 14 games unbeaten in the top-flight, they have drawn their last three games and are four points adrift of Liverpool in fourth place.\nUnited only had themselves to blame in a wasteful performance. Marcus Rashford, who completed a full 90 minutes for the first time since November, highlighted his team's sloppiness by losing possession 21 times - more than any other player on the pitch.\nWayne Rooney was brought off the bench at half time, but failed to change the game, having become the club's leading all-time goal scorer in the previous league match at Stoke.\nTetchy Mourinho walks out of BBC interview\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"We didn't score. You don't score, it is not possible to win.\n\"Their goalkeeper was good.\n\"We needed to score, we needed more time to play. If you played 35-40 minutes in both halves, it is a lot. I think Hull City tried to see where they could go, the way they could behave and tried to see what the referee would allow them to do.\n\"They had the feedback and were comfortable to do what they did. I am not critical of that. They are fighting against relegation and every point is gold.\nAsked by BBC commentator Martin Fisher what upset him about referee Mike Jones' performance: \"If you do not know football, you should not have a microphone in your hand.\"\nCan Hull stay up?\nBefore this game, Hull had lost nine straight away games, with their last point on their travels coming at Burnley in early September.\nBut under new boss Marco Silva they have shown enough improvement to suggest they can preserve their top-flight status.\nThe Portuguese has led Hull to a win and a draw in his first three games - with a defeat coming against leaders Chelsea - and lie four points away from safety.\nHaving beaten United in the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final last week, Hull may even feel disappointed by not taking all three points with Markovic coming agonisingly close to clinching the winner late on.\nHowever, striker Oumar Niasse was lucky not to be given a red card after making late challenges on Michael Carrick and Daley Blind, having earlier received a yellow card.\n'Sometimes you have to suffer'\nHull boss Marco Silva: \"It is a very good result for us against a very good team. We played like a team with great attitude, spirit and character. What we showed tonight again, I am happy.\n\"Sometimes you have to suffer in moments but we have to play as a team.\nFirst Old Trafford shutout since 1952 - the stats\nManchester United are on the current longest unbeaten run in the Premier League this season (14 games - won seven, drawn seven).\nHull City have picked up just two points in their 10 Premier League meetings with Manchester United (won zero, drawn two, lost eight).\nMan Utd have attempted 85 shots (including blocks) against newly promoted sides at Old Trafford this season but have found the net just twice.\nThis is the first time United have failed to beat two different newly promoted clubs at home in a Premier League season since 1994-95 (Nottingham Forest and Leicester).\nHull kept their first clean sheet at Old Trafford in all competitions since January 1952.\nThe Red Devils have only lost once in their last 20 home Premier League games (won 12, drawn seven) - against Manchester City in September 2016.\nIn fact, United have now gone unbeaten in 18 home games in all competitions (won 12, drawn six). It is their longest run since October 2011 (37 games).\nHull have won four points in three Premier League games under Marco Silva, one more than they managed in the previous nine under Mike Phelan.\nWhat next?\nUnited travel to champions Leicester City on Sunday (kick-off 16:00 GMT), while Hull host title challengers Liverpool on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 1-1 Everton\nVeteran striker Peter Crouch scored his 100th Premier League goal as Stoke were held to an entertaining draw at home to Everton.\nCrouch, 36, applied a simple finish early in the first half to bring up his century almost 15 years on from opening his account for Aston Villa against Newcastle in April 2002\n, external\n- a goal scored against his current Stoke team-mate Shay Given.\nEverton equalised when Seamus Coleman, on his 200th league appearance for the Toffees, saw his cross-shot fly in off Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross.\nThe goal was initially ruled out for offside after Romelu Lukaku strayed beyond the last Stoke outfield player, but after a conversation between referee Craig Pawson and his assistant, the decision was reversed.\nStoke were incensed by the decision, their frustration no doubt compounded by the knowledge that they should already have been out of sight, with Crouch seeing a crisp volley flash just wide and Marko Arnautovic denied superbly by Joel Robles when one on one.\nBoth sides had chances to take all the points in the second half, with Stoke new boy Saido Berahino almost marking his debut off the bench with a goal only for Ramiro Funes Mori to head off the line, while Everton teenager Tom Davies saw a bullet header saved brilliantly by Lee Grant.\nThe stalemate sees Stoke move into ninth place on 29 points, while Everton - eight points better off - stay seventh.\nReaction to Wednesday's Premier League games\nCrouch's century - club by club, strike by strike\nEvergreen Crouch keeps on rolling\nCrouch has had a varied 20-year professional career, taking him from non-league football on loan with Dulwich Hamlet in 1999 all the way to a Champions League final with Liverpool in 2007.\nHe has played for 10 different clubs - including two separate spells at both Portsmouth and Tottenham - but while the surroundings have been ever-changing, the constant has been goals.\nCrouch had hit 28 in the second tier for QPR and Portsmouth before he was handed a chance at the top level with Aston Villa in 2002. He marked his debut with a goal against Newcastle on the same day that Alan Shearer, on the opposing side, scored his 199th in the competition.\nFifteen years on, Crouch is still doing the business, and found himself in the right place to put Stoke ahead in the seventh minute, turning the ball home from six yards after Charlie Adam's long ball forward was brilliantly brought down and laid off by the influential Arnautovic.\nCrouch's strike sees him become the 26th man to bring up 100 Premier League goals and further underlines the renaissance the former England striker has enjoyed in recent months.\nLast season, Crouch appeared surplus to requirements, featuring in just 18 games and failing to score in the league, but this term he has repaid manager Mark Hughes' faith in spades, with seven goals in all competitions.\nEverton equaliser causes controversy\nEverton had barely had a sniff of goal before they equalised towards the end of the first half, with Stoke far and away the dominant force in the match.\nAnd when it arrived, the visitors' goal had more than a whiff of controversy about it.\nThe referee's assistant raised his flag after Coleman's shot struck Shawcross and flew into the net, but the reaction of Everton's players appeared to persuade referee Pawson to consult with his colleague, after which the goal was awarded.\nReplays showed Lukaku had indeed strayed offside, but he was deemed not to be interfering with play - and the fact that the ball went in off a Stoke player no doubt helped the officials reach their decision.\nOffside or not? The managers' view\nStoke boss Hughes said Everton were \"fortunate\" to be awarded the goal but appeared to criticise his players for not quickly playing on when the offside decision was first given.\n\"In my view, Lukaku was offside,\" said Hughes. \"He's made a movement to the ball and my understanding was if you do that you're offside, so we're a little bit aggrieved with that.\n\"We should have got the ball down and played on but we allowed Everton to surround the referee and reverse the decision.\"\nOpposite number Ronald Koeman said: \"I think the defender touches the ball and that makes it a goal.\n\"I can understand why Mark Hughes is frustrated. First the linesman flagged for offside and then it's a goal. It's a very difficult situation for the referee.\n\"But I think after the game, everyone knows 1-1 is a good result.\"\nMan of the match - Charlie Adam (Stoke)\nEverton's backline finally breached - match stats\nPeter Crouch has scored in four of his last five Premier League games; this after a run of 21 appearances in the competition without a goal.\nMarko Arnautovic has had a hand in 40 Premier League goals for Stoke City (19 goals, 21 assists) - 11 more than any other team-mate since his debut for the club in 2013.\nCrouch's opening goal ended Everton's run of 301 minutes - just over five hours - without conceding in the Premier League.\nThree of Ryan Shawcross' four own goals in the Premier League have come against Merseyside clubs (two against Everton, one against Liverpool)\nStoke City have scored the highest proportion of their goals in the first half of Premier League matches this season (59% - 17 out of 29).\n'There are some fantastic players in that 100 club' - reaction\nStoke striker Peter Crouch: \"You're not thinking about 100, you're just thinking about scoring for the team. It's great to get in, there's some fantastic players in that 100 club, players I look up to, and it's great for me personally.\n\"I was stuck on 96 for a while and it was frustrating because I wasn't playing. That spell I've had out, it's made me realised I don't want to be out of the side again.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"I thought we were the better team and had more clear-cut chances. Marko had a couple of real chances with one on ones and we didn't convert them.\"\nOn Crouch's landmark, he added: \"Everybody talks about his personality and his character but above all he's an exceptional football player.\n\"It's fantastic. It's credit to him. Since he's come back into the side, he's been excellent. Everton found it very hard to cope with the unique threat he poses.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"We had some good chances in the second half but I think it's a fair result as the best chances in the first 45 minutes went to Stoke. Joel had to make two great saves.\n\"I'm really pleased about our performance today. It was a difficult start after going 1-0 down, but we had some good movement and chances.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are back in Premier League action on Saturday at 15:00 GMT, with Stoke at West Brom and Everton at home to Bournemouth."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 3-1 Arsenal\nChelsea tightened their grip on the Premier League title race and delivered a blow to Arsenal's aspirations with a convincing victory at Stamford Bridge.\nManager Arsene Wenger, watching from the stands as he served the third of a four-match touchline ban, was hoping Arsenal could respond to Tuesday's shock home defeat by Watford - but Chelsea exerted their authority to leave the Gunners 12 points behind the leaders.\nMarcos Alonso gave Chelsea the lead after 13 minutes, heading home after Diego Costa's header came back off the bar. Arsenal were unhappy with Alonso's challenge on Hector Bellerin that saw the defender take a heavy blow to the head which forced his substitution, but referee Martin Atkinson saw nothing wrong.\nEden Hazard made the decisive contribution with a magnificent solo goal eight minutes after half-time, leaving a trail of Arsenal players in his wake in a run from the halfway line before beating Petr Cech.\nThe goalkeeper's poor clearance gifted substitute Cesc Fabregas Chelsea's third, five minutes from time, and Olivier Giroud's late goal barely counted as consolation for Arsenal. The visitors had chances but saw Thibaut Courtois save well from Gabriel, Mesut Ozil and Danny Welbeck.\n'Arsenal have settled for fourth again'\nRelive Chelsea's win over Arsenal\nReaction from Stamford Bridge and the rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nCan anyone stop Conte's Chelsea?\nChelsea's lead at the top of the Premier League was 12 points at the conclusion of this victory - although Tottenham moved back to within nine points with a win against Middlesbrough - and to underscore the scale of their improvement, it is worth going back to the first meeting between these clubs at Arsenal in September.\nTheir 3-0 loss to the Gunners left Chelsea in eighth place and eight points behind then-leaders Manchester City after six games. This proved to be a watershed moment for the Blues and manager Antonio Conte.\nIn the intervening 18 games after Conte switched to his preferred three-man central defensive system, they have won 16 league games, lost at Spurs and drawn at Liverpool. It has been a powerhouse run that has effectively brought a 20-point swing in the title race.\nChelsea once more looked the model of efficiency, although they conceded more chances than Conte would have liked, with N'Golo Kante a tireless midfield influence.\nThe Italian wanted to make amends for that heavy loss at Emirates Stadium and he had the players and system to do it in style.\nAnd when they have individuals who can produce game-defining moments like Hazard, it is almost impossible to see any way they will leave the door far enough ajar for any of their pursuers to squeeze through.\nConte's celebration after Hazard's goal showed how much the win meant to him.\nAll over for Arsenal?\nArsenal's loss here at Stamford Bridge caps a dreadful week for the Gunners and manager Wenger - watching from the stands as their title hopes were surely snuffed out for another year.\nFirst they were knocked off course by that defeat by Watford and here they were beaten by a Chelsea side that looked like everything Arsenal did not. Strong, streetwise, ruthless and confident.\nWenger's side were limp in the opening phases, not even getting a touch in the Chelsea penalty area for 35 minutes and when chances did come along they were squandered.\nWenger can make all the usual positive noises but this was, ultimately, an emphatic beating and barring a dramatic and unforeseen turn of events, the wait for their first title since the year of \"The Invincibles\" in 2003-04 will go on.\nA single banner saying \"Enough Is Enough. Time To Go\" was held aloft in the Arsenal end - but it was almost a token gesture of defiance, rather like Giroud's late goal.\nThe two faces of Chelsea\nThis Chelsea side mixes silk and steel - and does it in the shape of N'Golo Kante and Eden Hazard.\nKante has been a key contributor this season and was again here. He breaks up opposition attacks and starts Chelsea's own. He makes it his business to make life impossible for opponents.\nHazard sprinkles the stardust on Chelsea, as he proved with that slalom, weaving run for the crucial second goal that effectively decided the contest.\nChelsea look a team for all season. And look like Premier League champions in waiting.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nWhat the managers said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"It was an important game. I consider Arsenal one of the six teams that can fight for the title until the end of the season. To put them 12 points behind is very important for us.\n\"In four days we have had two games against two great teams. I think we are showing we deserve to stay on top of the table. I am very pleased for my players. In every session they show me great attitude and great will to fight and win this league.\n\"Was the first goal a foul? In England never. No.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a foul. If you look at a number of games recently we can feel sorry.\n\"It was 100% a foul, it was even dangerous play. That doesn't take anything away from the performance of Chelsea.\n\"We had a strong start but didn't take the opportunities and after half-time the second goal was the killer for us.\"\nThe key stats\nChelsea have won nine successive Premier League home games and the aggregate score in these matches is 27-4 in Chelsea's favour.\nArsenal have lost four of their past nine Premier League games, the same number that they lost in their previous 35 matches in the competition.\nChelsea have won all nine Premier League games in which Hazard has scored this season.\nPetr Cech has failed to keep a clean sheet in three of his four Premier League games against Chelsea for Arsenal and has conceded in both meetings at Stamford Bridge.\nDiego Costa failed to score in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since 2 May 2016 (three in a row).\nCesc Fabregas scored his first ever Premier League goal against Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea will be looking to extend their lead further when they travel to Burnley in the Premier League next Sunday (12:30 GMT), while Arsenal host Hull on Saturday (12:30 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Watford 2-1 Burnley\nM'Baye Niang scored one goal and made another on his home debut for Watford as 10-man Burnley's miserable away record continued.\nSean Dyche's Clarets, who have not won on their travels since last May, had midfielder Jeff Hendrick sent off in the sixth minute for a two-footed challenge on Jose Holebas.\nNiang, signed on loan from AC Milan last month, then crossed for Troy Deeney to head his third goal in four matches.\nThe winger guided in Holebas' left-wing cross with a fine header to make it 2-0 just before half-time.\nAshley Barnes gave Burnley hope by scoring a penalty with 12 minutes left after Sebastian Prodl handled Joey Barton's shot - but they could not equalise.\nRelive Watford 2-1 Burnley as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nWatford winning again after wobble\nWalter Mazzarri's side were slipping towards relegation trouble after a dreadful run around the turn of the year, during which they took just three points from seven matches.\nIt did not help Mazzarri that a side showing seven changes tumbled out of the FA Cup at League One Millwall last Sunday, a result that prompted an apology from the head coach.\nYet under pressure, the Hornets have responded. Goalscorer Deeney said afterwards that this had been a big week for the club, a feeling intensified off the pitch by the emotion that surrounded the funeral of their former manager Graham Taylor on Wednesday.\nTaylor was the man who led Watford into the top flight for the first time in 1982; the current generation at Vicarage Road showed they have the character to stay there.\nVictory at Arsenal on Tuesday was a huge statement of intent. This performance did not match that one, with Watford tailing off in the second half, but they got the job done, and are 10 points clear of the bottom three.\nBurnley refuse to wilt\nA Burnley away victory is harder to come by than an iceberg lettuce at the moment; they last won on their travels on 7 May last year.\nDyche can point to impressive performances and bad luck in recent away games - and he has done - but they were not helped at Vicarage Road by the early dismissal of Hendrick, who was ruled to have gone in with two feet on Holebas.\nWhen Burnley went in 2-0 behind at half-time, they could have folded, but instead made a creditable attempt at a fightback.\nGoalkeeper Tom Heaton kept them in the game with a fine save after Deeney connected with a Niang cross, and once Barnes scored his penalty, Watford looked very edgy.\nThe striker could have saved an unlikely point late on when a Craig Cathcart slip left him clear, but goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes blocked to ensure Watford's win.\nWho would be a referee?\nReferee Michael Oliver must have known he was in for a tough day when Niang sent Burnley left-back Stephen Ward flying into the air with a woefully mistimed challenge just five minutes in.\nHaving only just put his yellow card back into his pocket after showing it to Niang, Oliver was then surrounded by furious Burnley players as he waved red at Hendrick.\nThis was not the easiest match to referee, with the first half in particular littered with fouls.\nOliver, at times, had the air of an exasperated primary school teacher, and was caught on camera shaking his head as he booked Etienne Capoue for a trip.\nOverall, Oliver did well. He stepped in after half-time to prevent Deeney and Matt Lowton coming to blows after a tussle by the touchline threatened to get out of hand, and was right to disallow a Deeney goal for handball in stoppage time.\nEven then, his afternoon was not over. The referee was visited in his dressing room after the game by Dyche, who wanted to know why Niang - already on a yellow card - had not been sent off for running into the crowd to celebrate his goal.\nMan of the match - Tom Cleverley (Watford)\n'I'm very angry'\nWatford head coach Walter Mazzarri: \"Our first-half performance was better than our second, and this is why I'm very angry. The big teams close these games 3-0, or 4-0, and we didn't do it. We have to grow in this mentality.\n\"This year, our objective is to stay in the Premier League, and becoming an important team. We have to work on this, and keep doing what we're doing.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, on why he went in to see referee Oliver after the game: \"I was only asking why M'Baye Niang wasn't sent off. He had been booked earlier, then ran into their crowd to celebrate his goal, and you're not allowed to do that.\n\"It wasn't so much about our sending-off. It's a tough one for referees. I don't think there was a lot of actual contact, but we know most times that's going to be a sending-off.\n\"I thought we were absolutely outstanding in the second half.

        "article_text": "Southampton 1-3 West Ham United\nWest Ham came from behind to beat Southampton and move into the top half of the Premier League.\nThe Saints took an early lead when Manolo Gabbiadini blasted in an opener on his debut after a \u00a314m move from Napoli on transfer deadline day.\nBut Andy Carroll equalised when he finished after a fine pass from Pedro Obiang, who then put the Hammers ahead with a 30-yard low effort.\nWest Ham grabbed a third as Mark Noble's free-kick deflected in off Saints midfielder Steven Davis.\nRelive West Ham's win over Southampton as it happened\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League matches\nGabbiadini's dream start, but it ends in disappointment\nWhat a way to introduce yourself to your new club as Italy international Gabbiadini only needed 12 minutes to open his goalscoring account after his move from Serie A.\nIt came when he collected Jay Rodriguez's lofted ball over a high West Ham defence and the 25-year-old timed his run perfectly to beat the Hammers offside trap.\nHe then ran into the penalty area and blasted the ball from a tight angle past Darren Randolph.\nHowever, Gabbiadini should have done better later on when he shot over the bar after Cheikhou Kouyate's misjudged header had gifted the Italian a chance.\nWith club record signing Sofiane Boufal limping off in the second half with a foot injury, Gabbiadini will need to show his best form if the Saints are to stay away from the relegation zone.\nBut Saints fans may be getting nervous. They are now only seven points above the bottom three, with six defeats in their last seven league games, and they were not good enough against West Ham.\nSouthampton's defensive problems continue\nWhat is the reason for Southampton's slump? Well, they are defending badly and have now conceded 10 goals in their last three matches in all competitions.\nTheir former captain Jose Fonte looked assured in the West Ham defence after his \u00a38m move in January and with influential defender Virgil van Dijk out for up to three months with an ankle injury, the Saints look short of options at the back.\nThey provided little resistance as West Ham, who moved up to ninth in the table, equalised within two minutes of conceding the opener.\nThe Saints backline were caught square and Obiang was allowed to slot a pass through to Carroll, who then registered his fourth goal in as many games.\nJust before the break, Obiang was given time and space to drill in a low shot from 30 yards out, which went through a crowded penalty area and goalkeeper Fraser Forster could not react in time.\nIf the first two West Ham goals came from poor Southampton defending, the third was down to bad luck. Noble's free-kick was on target and heading straight at Forster before Davis' swipe at the ball steered it into his own net.\nSouthampton did force Hammers goalkeeper Darren Randolph into a number of routine saves late in the second half, but it made no difference to the result.\nRare St Mary's win for West Ham - the stats\nManolo Gabbiadini's first Premier League goal was also the 400th goal netted by an Italian player in the competition (excluding own goals).\nAndy Carroll has scored four goals in his last four Premier League appearances, the same total he had scored in his previous 14 before this run.\nAfter conceding just five goals in their first eight home Premier League games under Claude Puel, Saints have shipped nine in their last four.\nThis was West Ham's first away victory at Southampton since November 2000. They had drawn four and lost three of the previous seven matches.\nThe Saints have lost three home Premier League games from leading positions this season - no side has lost more.\nMan of the match - Pedro Obiang (West Ham)\nBilic on a 'crazy league' & Fonte's mixed emotions - what they said\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel said: \"We started well - a fantastic goal from Gabbiadini - but after that we made mistakes and it was difficult.\n\"In the second half we had many chances but without the possibility to come back. We have the quality to play, to score, now we need to keep a clean sheet. We have to correct this and find a clean sheet and find confidence about the situation.\"\nOn Italian striker Manolo Gabbiadini, who scored on his debut, Puel added: \"I'm happy with his first game. We saw a great player for the future. He is technical, gives solutions, sees the game and is a very interesting player.\"\nOn their defensive problems, the Frenchman said: \"It is important to give confidence to the squad about the defensive chances. We can't replace the best defender (the injured Virgil Van Dijk) in the Premier League.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"The guys were fantastic, we had a gameplan and they executed it in the best way. We were solid behind the ball, we kept the ball, attacked well and it was a great team performance.\n\"We have a team that is working hard for each other. We have a brilliant atmosphere in the dressing room, not because Payet left, but because we have won six of nine. It is a crazy league and there are 42 points to play for. There are crazy results and that is why we have to keep playing as we are.\"\nOn Andy Carroll, who scored his fourth goal in four games, Bilic added: \"He is a matured man. He is happy, stable, has got three kids. The key is that and the number of training sessions. The best prevention of injuries is training.\"\nWest Ham's Jose Fonte, who handed in a transfer request at Southampton before joining the London club, said: \"The move is still fresh and only a couple of weeks ago I was still a Southampton player.\n\"No doubt it was tough, but the main thing was to stay focused on the game and do my job the best I could.\n\"It was almost eight seasons so it was tough but with the help of my team-mates and West Ham supporters the most important thing was achieving what we got - the three points.\n\"I always gave my best for Southampton - my sweat and blood - so my conscience is clear. The past was good but now I look forward to the new challenge ahead of me.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton play away at the Premier League's bottom team, Sunderland, on Saturday, 11 February (15:00 GMT), while West Ham host West Brom at the same time."

        "article_text": "Everton 6-3 Bournemouth\nRomelu Lukaku helped himself to four goals as Everton extended their unbeaten Premier League run to seven games with a thrilling victory over Bournemouth at Goodison Park.\nLukaku curled home an exquisite opener after just 30 seconds to equal the record for the fastest league goal of the season set by Chelsea's Pedro against Manchester United.\nLukaku's trickery set up James McCarthy for Everton's second before the Belgium striker doubled his tally when Simon Francis' suicidal back pass gifted him the opportunity to loft the ball over Artur Boruc for a 3-0 half-time lead.\nJoshua King's brace gave Bournemouth hope but Lukaku added two more inside the final 10 minutes to put the game to bed, although there was still time for Harry Arter to add a third for the visitors and Ross Barkley to slot in Everton's sixth.\nThe result was a fitting way for Everton manager Ronald Koeman to celebrate his 100th Premier League game, and takes the seventh-placed Toffees to within two points of Manchester United.\nFor slumping Bournemouth, meanwhile, defeat drops them to within six points of the relegation zone.\nEddie Howe's men - winless in 2017 - are now on a run of one victory in eight and have conceded 34 goals in their last 13 games - shipping at least three goals in nine of those.\nRelive the drama at Goodison Park\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League games\nBrilliant Lukaku steals the show\n\"We said we wanted to come out flying, we worked on it all week,\" Lukaku said as he held the match ball at full-time. \"There's no lack of confidence.\"\nThere certainly wasn't.\nEverton completely bullied the opening period, helped of course by taking such an early lead when Morgan Schneiderlin broke up play in midfield and Lukaku exchanged passes with McCarthy before stroking a lovely shot beyond Boruc.\nLukaku then breezed past two markers to set up McCarthy to make it 2-0 - the midfielder scoring at the second attempt - before adding his second of the contest with a cool finish when Francis inexplicably played the ball into his own area.\nHe very nearly got in once again to complete a 30-minute hat-trick only for Boruc to crowd him out, but he was not to be denied his treble as the game became stretched in the second half.\nWith the score at 3-2, he completed his hat-trick with a simple side-foot volley to kill off Bournemouth's hopes of completing an unlikely comeback, while his 17th goal of the campaign followed just moments later when ran on to a Barkley backheel, shrugged off his marker and found the corner.\nA heavy defeat, but Cherries show fight\nGiven their recent form, Bournemouth might have been expected to roll over after conceding after just 30 seconds, yet despite shipping six goals they will surely take some positives from this match.\nTheir three-man defence of Francis, Steve Cook and Tyrone Mings was ripped to shreds in the first half, but the switch to a four-man defence after the break paid instant dividends.\nWith former Liverpool youngsters Jordon Ibe and Brad Smith introduced for the second period, Bournemouth looked sharper from the outset.\nThey created a host of openings before King's brace - the first a nice chest down and finish from Jack Wilshere's lofted pass, the second a poacher's strike from Ryan Fraser's centre - set up a grandstand finish that was only derailed when Lukaku bagged his third.\n\"The start of the game killed us. You can't concede so quickly, it gives you a mountain to climb,\" said Howe, whose side have now lost five of their last six away league games.\n\"We got right back in the game, then conceded the fourth to knock the stuffing out of us.\"\nMan of the match - Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\n'If we keep this up, everything is possible'\nEverton striker Romelu Lukaku: \"It's disappointing we conceded the goals, but we showed mental resilience.\n\"We need to see the clips again because if you want to improve we need to get rid of the little problems.\n\"We have to believe that we can catch the teams ahead of us. We need to keep on winning and working hard for each other.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"That's not a normal result. It was a crazy game.\n\"Both teams changed systems - it was a tactical battle. They made it really difficult for us. We dropped in intensity after half-time, but the reaction to them getting back to 3-2 was good.\n\"We scored great goals. Romelu showed that he is one of the best finishers in football. Scoring is one of his big qualities. We need to support him, to create. We can improve, but he showed his best today. I'm not surprised because we see it in training.\n\"We are getting closer to the top six. We have momentum and we are confident. It's a long way to go until the end of the season. If we keep this up, everything is possible.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"We tried to do something different today, but it didn't work. Three injuries to defenders have made it difficult.\n\"We have been looking over our shoulder all season. We want to get to 40 points as quickly as possible.\"\nEverton better 2015-16 tally - match stats\nEverton have already won more points at home this season (25) than they managed in the whole of 2015/16 (23).\nRomelu Lukaku has scored the 300th hat-trick in Premier League history.\nOnly Duncan Ferguson (60) has scored more PL goals for Everton than Lukaku (59).\nLukaku has scored six goals in his last three Premier League appearances at Goodison Park, after a run of four league games without one there.\nThis was the first time that the Belgian striker has ever scored four goals in a Premier League match.\nJames McCarthy scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career.\nJoshua King scored his 11th and 12th Premier League goals for Bournemouth; making him the Cherries' highest scoring player in the competition.\nThis was just the second match in Premier League history at Goodison Park to witness nine goals, after Everton 3-6 Chelsea in August 2014.\nWhat's next?\nEverton return to Premier League action on Saturday, 11 February, when they make the trip to Middlesbrough for a 15:00 GMT kick-off. Bournemouth are back in action on Monday, 13 February, when Manchester City visit the Vitality Stadium (20:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 0-4 Sunderland\nSunderland scored four first-half goals to thrash Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park as the Black Cats moved level on points with their Premier League relegation rivals.\nLamine Kone reacted quickest to Wayne Hennessey's spill to steer in Sunderland's opener after 10 minutes.\nThe visitors then scored three goals in six minutes in a stunning end to the first half as Didier Ndong struck a superb effort from 25 yards before Jermain Defoe punished lax Palace defending with two excellent finishes.\nA fan got onto the pitch to confront Damien Delaney as the Palace players were booed off at half-time on a miserable afternoon for Sam Allardyce against his former club.\nSunderland easily controlled the second half to secure their first away Premier League win in six games and join Palace on 19 points.\nBut David Moyes' side remain bottom of the table following Hull City's 2-0 victory over Liverpool.\nPalace deserved boos - Allardyce\nRelive the action from Selhurst Park\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League games\nThree goals. Six minutes.\nDespite Kone's early goal, Palace seemed to be starting to dictate the game. But they were stunned three times in an astonishing spell going into the break.\nNdong scored a memorable first goal for Sunderland, robbing substitute Joe Ledley easily in midfield before striding forward and curling a fine strike off the inside of the right post, giving Hennessey no chance.\nPalace appeared incapable of limping through to half-time without inflicting further damage on themselves as Defoe duly capitalised with two goals in two minutes.\nFor both goals, the hosts afforded Adnan Januzaj far too much time and space, with the on-loan Manchester United midfielder providing a deftly-weighted pass that Defoe struck into the far corner for the first. He then provided a lovely ball from deep that Defoe ran on to and easily turned James Tomkins to fire in.\nAt the start of the game, Defoe was the only Sunderland player in their starting line-up to score this season and while Moyes will be heartened to see two others contribute, his 34-year-old star striker gave yet another reminder why he alone will largely determine the Black Cats' fate this season.\nDefoe now has 14 Premier League goals this season out of the 24 Sunderland have scored in total as he came back to haunt the manager who he helped to keep the Black Cats up last year.\nPalace could end Big Sam's record\nPrior to the game, Palace boss Allardyce said he would \"hate\" to see a repeat performance of the defeat by Swansea in early January.\nHe got something far worse. They were abject at times and provided little resistance in falling to another damaging defeat by a relegation-threatened side.\nThe target of the fans' ire remains at the players and not Allardyce, with chants of \"you're not fit to wear the shirt\" accompanying a cacophony of boos and jeers.\nThat ill-feeling turned ugly as a fan managed to remonstrate with Delaney face-to-face at the interval before being removed, with stewards later forced to hold back groups of fans trying to get into the tunnel after the final whistle.\n\"I saw fear strike the players,\" said Allardyce. \"It was a huge shock for me what I saw. The lads find it difficult to play here at the moment.\"\n\"It is not often the players get much stick but they deserved the booing. I have to apologise for the first half.\"\nAllardyce has never been relegated from the Premier League, but he could see that record end this season if his side continue to perform like this.\nMan of the match - Lamine Kone (Sunderland)\nKone makes Sunderland solid again\nThis was Sunderland's second straight Premier League clean sheet but their first away from home this season and, although Palace's finishing was poor, it was another impressive performance from centre-back Kone.\nHe took his goal well, hooking his effort inside the far post after Hennessey could only parry Kone's intitial header under pressure from Billy Jones.\nBut it was the way he easily handled Christian Benteke throughout that was most striking, overpowering the Belgium striker and carrying the ball into midfield to release pressure and start attacks.\nFollowing another solid showing in the goalless draw with Tottenham in midweek, Kone, 28, looks to be back to the level that saw him coveted by other Premier League clubs last season.\n'Fear gripped the players' - managers reaction\nCrystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce: \"Fear gripped the players and it hasn't allowed them to express their ability. I cant think it can be anything other than that.\n\"It is a difficult one because the fans are so good here. They come to support the club. It was a sell-out today. They are desperate for the club to do well.\"\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"We knew the task we would be up against but we took our opportunities when they came along. Once we got the goal you could see the confidence grew.\n\"I don't think I can think of many times as a manager I have been 4-0 up at half-time, I don't know if I ever have been.\n\"It gets us three points and more confidence, more belief. It is going to be a tough job but if we had lost it would have been much tougher. Every game is must-win.\"\nSix in six for Defoe against Palace - match stats\nSunderland scored as many away goals today (four) as they did in their previous nine Premier League away games combined.\nThis was Sunderland's biggest margin of victory in an away Premier League game since beating Bradford City 4-0 in October 1999.\nCrystal Palace have lost eight of their past nine Premier League games at Selhurst Park, including the past five in a row.\nJermain Defoe has netted six goals in his past six Premier League games versus Crystal Palace.\nPalace conceded four first-half goals in a Premier League match for the first time.\nBefore today's win, Jack Rodwell had made 37 Premier League starts for Sunderland without a victory (D17, L20); the longest winless run of starts at a single club (from first start).\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to face Stoke at 15:00 GMT on 11 February, while Sunderland host Southampton on the same day and at the same time."

If you look at Stoke, they have a smashing squad of players. They've got a strong squad so it's a good result for us today.\n\"The supporters have really stuck with us and got behind us and can see what we're trying to do. These things take time to get right and it really annoys me when people change managers quickly.\n\"You get labelled for things you've done at other clubs, but I have always tried to get the best out of my players at all the clubs I've been at.\nOn not shaking hands with Hughes: \"I shook hands with Eddie [Niedzwiecki, Stoke coach] and Mark was walking away towards their supporters so that was that.\"\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"We've played a lot better than today. We've been on a decent run and have been playing well but for whatever reason it wasn't good enough\n\"I was disappointed in the referee to be perfectly honest.

In the last 14 days Jurgen Klopp's side have been knocked out of the FA Cup and the EFL Cup, and seen their hopes of a first league title since 1990 all but vanish for another season.\nWhile Jurgen Klopp remains unbeaten in seven games against the top-six, the German has now seen his side lose to Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea City and Hull City.\nThis was as bad as any of them; an abject, disjointed performance sprinkled with individual errors and a lack of cutting edge.\nLiverpool's defenders were as much to blame for the first goal despite Mignolet's mistake, leaving N'Diaye completely unmarked when he steered the hosts ahead.\nThe Reds enjoyed 72% possession but as Klopp said afterwards: \"Possession is only good when you create something from it.\"\nMan of the match - Andrea Ranocchia (Hull City)\n'No excuses'\nHull manager Marco Silva: \"It is a fantastic afternoon for us.

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Middlesbrough\nTottenham re-established a nine-point gap to Premier League leaders Chelsea with a workmanlike victory over Middlesbrough at White Hart Lane.\nChelsea had moved 12 points clear with their impressive 3-1 win over Arsenal in the lunchtime kick-off, but Harry Kane's second-half penalty ensured Spurs did not cede any ground to their London rivals.\nTottenham now have clear air in second place after defeats for nearest challengers Arsenal and Liverpool, although fifth-placed Manchester City could close back to within a point when they play on Sunday.\nTottenham's seventh successive home win was secured when Kane fired home from 12 yards after Son Heung-min was hauled down in the area by Bernardo Espinosa and referee Mark Clattenburg correctly pointed to the spot.\nThe hosts were without injured defenders Danny Rose and Jan Vertonghen, but Middlesbrough did not do enough to put pressure on their understudies, with the visitors failing to produce a shot on target over the 90 minutes.\nBoro have won just one of their past 10 matches and are being sucked ever closer to the relegation fight, with one point now separating them from third-bottom Hull City.\nRelive the action from White Hart Lane\nReaction from all of Saturday's games\nSpurs do just enough for victory\nThis will not go down as one of the great nights at White Hart Lane - far from it - but winning when playing below par is a hallmark of all great teams so there are plenty of positives to take away.\nAnd it should not be forgotten that Middlesbrough's campaign to date has been built on frustrating the opposition, with their 12 away games so far producing just 21 goals in total.\nAitor Karanka's men have drawn six times on the road this term and very nearly succeeded in snatching a point again, and would have done so but for Bernardo's ill-judged tackle on Son, which allowed Kane to score his ninth league goal in his past eight appearances at home.\nThat spared Spurs the frustration of failing to score in back-to-back league games since May 2015, having been held to a 0-0 draw at Sunderland in their last outing.\nThe goal aside, Spurs also came close when Christian Eriksen's well-hit shot brought a good save from Victor Valdes, while Toby Alderweireld and Son both hit the frame of the goal and Kane had an effort ruled out for offside.\n\"We created the chances, we just weren't finishing them,\" said Kane. \"We are delighted with the win. No game is easy in the Premier League. We'll take 1-0.\"\nAre toothless Boro heading for trouble?\nBoro's failure to get a shot on target is perhaps as misleading statistic, as they certainly applied pressure on the Tottenham goal on more than one occasion.\nAlvaro Negredo headed over the bar in the first half and in the second executed a superb bicycle kick from the right side of the area that Hugo Llloris could only watch as it flashed past his right post.\nTheir best chance arrived at the death when Marten de Roon flashed a volley just wide, but it would have been a barely deserved equaliser had it found the net.\nBoro have attempted a league-low 56 shots on target in the Premier League this season, 16 fewer than any other team, and will need to show greater ambition in the coming months if they are to pull clear of danger.\nMan of the match - Victor Wanyama (Tottenham)\n'I think we showed we were much better'\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think in the last few games the opponents have played very deep and closed the gaps, difficult to break down. It's important the control we showed today and the chances we created.\n\"I don't think they had a shot on target which is also important. I think we showed we were much better and deserved the win.\n\"When you don't kill the game you leave it open. In the last second you can concede, that's the Premier League. Thankfully it didn't and we are happy.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"At the end we had a few chances to score. I said at half-time the way we had to play, without pressure.\n\"If you are here playing under pressure against Tottenham it is impossible and at the end we had chances to score.\n\"The players did their best and that is the good thing. They put everything on the pitch. Again, we have to know it will be a tough season but we are showing we can compete against every single team.\"\nSpurs on best home run since 2006 - match stats\nTottenham have won 26 of their past 28 Premier League games against newly promoted sides (D2 L0).\nTottenham have won each of their past seven home league games, last achieving a longer run in August 2009 (a run of eight).\nSpurs' run of home wins is their best within the same season since December 2006 (also seven in a row).\nPochettino's side are still unbeaten in all 12 of their Premier League home matches this season (W10 D2 L0).\nMiddlesbrough did not attempt a single shot on target - for the second time in a Premier League game this season (also vs Everton in September).\nWhat's next?\nA big game awaits Tottenham next Saturday with a trip to top-four rivals Liverpool their assignment (17:30 GMT). Middlesbrough host Everton the same day, at 15:00 GMT."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 2-1 Swansea City\nGabriel Jesus scored twice as Manchester City moved up to third in the Premier League by overcoming a battling Swansea City in injury time at Etihad Stadium.\nJesus had an immediate impact in front of his home crowd, using his natural pace to dart forward and put his side in front with a tap past Lukasz Fabianski.\nThe hosts dominated the first half, but the visitors had the better of the second half, taking advantage of Manchester City's lack of intensity as Gylfi Sigurdsson picked up Luciano Narsingh's cross and steered the ball beyond a diving Willy Caballero.\nHowever, the goal spurred the home side on. They picked up the pace again and Jesus was on hand to slide home a winner after his header was parried by Fabianski.\nAnalysis: Jesus not ready to replace Aguero yet\nGuardiola tinkers, with mixed results\nPep Guardiola has made 80 changes to his starting line-up this season, 15 more than any other Premier League manager, and he opted to keep Jesus up front in place of Sergio Aguero.\nFor all Swansea's recent improvement, they could not match City's pace in the first half. The hosts swamped Swansea's defence and created space, passing with a fluency that has not always been evident this season.\nJesus, City's \u00a327m Brazilian signing, showed little sign of fatigue as he made his third appearance in seven days. He was on the move from the opening minutes of the game, his first shot flying over the bar, and his quick movement allowed him to tap the ball beyond Fabianski.\nThe challenge for Guardiola's side now is to maintain that level of intensity. When it dipped, City looked vulnerable in defence and their slick passing was lost as Swansea pressed forward.\nIt showed why they have not kept a clean sheet at home in the Premier League since their 1-0 win over Watford in December.\nThe frenetic final few minutes, which saw the hosts finally react after going a goal behind, forced them to up the pace back to their original level.\nBut those dips in concentration are a worrying sign for Guardiola.\nSwans' second-half burst shows growing confidence\nAfter initially winning just three of their first 19 top-flight games this season, the Swans arrived at Etihad Stadium having won three of their last four games, and with an increased confidence under new manager Paul Clement.\nThey were overwhelmed by the home side for the first 45 minutes but Clement's consistency with his squad, starting the game with an unchanged side for the third time before boosting them with shrewd substitutions in the second half, turned the tables for Swansea.\nAt one point, goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had made more passes than any other Swansea player, and they did not have a single shot in the first half. But when Swansea pressed forward, it was Guardiola's side who were forced onto the back foot.\nSwansea found a fluency with their passing and defender Alfie Mawson, who worked hard in the first half to deny the home side, picked up the pace to twice outfox City's defence. The equaliser felt inevitable, with Sigurdsson moving his feet well to pick up Narsingh's cross.\nIf Swansea could have found an extra gear in the closing minutes they might have been able to hold on and secure a point. However, Manchester City's final burst of pace, and the scramble in front of the goal that led to Jesus' winner, showed that the visitors still have some work to do in defence.\nMan of the match - Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City)\nWhat the managers said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is the first time we have won a game in the last minute. The first half and second half were much different. They were better.\n\"Always when you go 1-0 you don't know whether to attack or wait back. At the end we won and that is important.\n\"Many times this season in last minute we have conceded. It was similar here and we were lucky here that Swansea scored before the last minute and we had time to recover.\"\n\"Gabriel Jesus is strong, fast and has really good movement. He has arrived really, really, well. He is Gabriel Jesus. We are happy to have him.\"\nSwansea manager Paul Clement speaking to BBC Sport: \"We deserved more. Not in the first half, we didn't play well. We were nowhere near our potential. They are a good side. We were organised and in shape but one against one we were not aggressive enough.\n\"The players responded very well in the second half and were the better team. We got the equaliser and at that point you think we can see the game out for a valuable point.\n\"The circumstances of the goal we are disappointed about. I am very proud of the players. If we can build on that we will have some more wins not far away.\"\nMan City's winning run against Swansea - match stats\nGabriel Jesus became just the third Brazilian to score on his first two Premier League starts, with the other two also playing for Manchester City (Geovanni and Robinho).\nHe's also the first player since Stevan Jovetic to score two goals on his first home Premier League start for Man City.\nMan City have now won 11 home league games in a row against Swansea - they've only had a longer such run against a side twice in their history (13 v Wolves, 12 v Grimsby).\nMan City's winner was the 12th scored in the 90th minute this season - just one fewer than in the whole of 2015-16.\nIndeed, Swansea have conceded a 90th minute winner in their last two trips to the Etihad, with Kelechi Iheanacho scoring at the death last season.\nSince his Premier League debut in January 2012, only Yaya Toure (16) has scored more goals from outside the box than Gylfi Sigurdsson (13).\nSigurdsson has scored eight Premier League goals this season - his second best return in the competition (11 in 2015-16).\nJesus' goal, and his shot immediately before the goal, were Man City's only two shots on target in the second half.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City travel to Bournemouth on Monday, 13 February (20:00 GMT), while Swansea host champions Leicester on Sunday, 12 February (16:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 0-3 Manchester United\nPremier League champions Leicester are just one point above the relegation zone after defeat at home by Manchester United left them still searching for a first league win in 2017.\nA dour opening half came to life just before the break when the visitors scored twice in two minutes.\nFirst, Henrikh Mkhitaryan latched onto Chris Smalling's flick-on and raced through on goal before beating Kasper Schmeichel with a clinical finish.\nZlatan Ibrahimovic then took advantage of terrible Leicester marking to side-foot home his 15th Premier League goal of the season.\nJuan Mata ensured there was no way back for the hosts when he finished off a one-two with Mkhitaryan early in the second half.\nLeicester never looked like scoring, with their only shot on target a tame Wilfred Ndidi strike just before half-time.\nManchester United remain in the hunt for a top-four finish. They are sixth, one point behind Liverpool and two behind fourth-placed Arsenal.\nListen: Mahrez 'really is lacking in confidence'\nRelive Manchester United's win at Leicester\nCould the champions really go down?\nJose Mourinho was in charge of Chelsea the last time he visited the King Power Stadium. That was in December 2015 and he was sacked the day after a defeat that strengthened Leicester's title charge.\nThis time it is Foxes boss Claudio Ranieri who is under pressure. Far from defending their title, they are very much in a relegation dogfight and went into Sunday's game looking to record their first league win since New Year's Eve.\nA pacy attack of Ahmed Musa and Jamie Vardy promised much but ultimately offered little, the latter in particular a shadow of the striker who scored in 11 consecutive Premier League games last season.\nThe Foxes have now failed to score a league goal in five games this year, but of equal concern for Ranieri will have been his side's defending. Ibrahimovic was left unmarked to poke home Manchester United's second and then Wes Morgan played two players onside for the third.\nLeicester have not won away all season in the league, so it is their home form that has kept them out of the drop zone so far - 18 of their 21 points have been collected at the King Power Stadium.\nThis defeat, though, was their third in six home games and Ranieri will need to get things back on track quickly if the Foxes are to avoid being the first reigning top-flight champions to be relegated since Manchester City in 1938.\nRed Devils resolve goalscoring concerns?\nManchester United have been far too reliant on Ibrahimovic this season. The evergreen Swedish striker is the club's leading scorer with 10 more league goals than any other Manchester United player.\nIn an effort to relieve the Swede's burden, Mourinho started Marcus Rashford alongside him in a 4-4-2 formation.\nIt quickly became evident that Ibrahimovic was far more effective in a central role and after 20 minutes Mourinho reverted to 4-2-3-1 with Rashford, Mkhitaryan and Mata behind the former Paris St-Germain striker.\nThe change immediately improved the visitors' attacking strength as the pace of Mkhitaryan and Rashford, coupled with Mata's creativity, stretched Leicester's defence and left gaps for Manchester United to exploit, which they did to full effect.\nIn the end Leicester could not cope and although United will arguably face tougher defences this season, three different goalscorers and a convincing win will give Mourinho confidence his side can challenge for the top four, particularly with Liverpool and Arsenal's own challenge faltering.\nMan of the match - Henrikh Mkhitaryan\nWhat they said\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"When we conceded the first goal we got down. I don't understand why. It's important to be strong until the end and never give up. But the confidence is not so high.\n\"Last season was terrific but we are Leicester and every time we have to fight.\n\"We are together. I am fully confident in my players and the players are confident in me.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"It was really important for us. We lost two points in the last match at home and had three consecutive draws so we needed the points.\n\"I am happy. We don't have a league defeat since October and if we tried to transform the unlucky draws to victories, we would be in an amazing position.\"\nFoxes collecting unwanted records - the stats\nLeicester City are the first Premier League team to fail to score in the first five matches of a calendar year and the first top-flight side since Spurs in 1986.\nThey are the only side in the top-four English tiers to have failed to score in the league in 2017.\nManchester United are unbeaten in their past 15 Premier League games; their longest run since March 2013 (18 games unbeaten).\nThe Foxes are the second reigning Premier League champions to lose successive home league games by a three-goal margin (also Man Utd in 2013-14).\nThere were just 88 seconds between Henrikh Mkhitaryan's and Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goals for Man Utd.\nIbrahimovic has reached 15 Premier League goals for Man Utd in the fourth fastest number of games (23), following Van Nistelrooy (19) Yorke (20) and van Persie (21).\nJuan Mata has been involved in 86 Premier League goals since his debut (44 goals, 42 assists) - the highest goal involvement rate of any Premier League midfielder in that time.\nLeicester's cup final?\nAfter an FA Cup fourth-round replay against Derby at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday, Leicester have a potentially massive game in the Premier League on Sunday [kick-off 16:00 GMT]. They travel to Swansea, who are one place below the Foxes in 18th.\nManchester United, meanwhile, host Watford on Saturday [15:00] knowing three points could lift them into the top four."

He added a penalty in injury-time which was awarded after Sam Clucas was sent off for handball from Lucas Perez's header.\nIn between, Hector Bellerin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal.\nStriker Oumar Niasse had Hull's best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on.\nRelive Arsenal's win over Hull\nWenger denies he plans to leave in May\nDecision one goes against Hull - the opening goal\nArsenal had been pressing for the opener before Sanchez's intervention.\nThe visitors failed to clear Kieran Gibbs' low shot and as the ball ricocheted off goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic on the ground it bounced off the Chilean's hand and into the net.\nFor a deliberate handball, Football Association laws state:\n, external\nthere must be \"movement of the hand towards the ball\"\nthe \"distance between opponent and the ball\" should be considered\nOn this occasion, Sanchez did not look like he purposefully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jakupovic.\nAfter consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal, but prior to that in the first half, Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area, for which no penalty was given.\nAfter the game, Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time.\nRobertson added: \"The ref told us he didn't give it because he wasn't 100% sure.

The ref said the ball was going away from goal.\"\nWhen asked if Gibbs should have been sent off, Hull boss Marco Silva said: \"Yes. It is true. Markovic go to the goal.\"\nHull penalised late on\nWith Hull pushing for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter by the home side. Jakupovic came sprinting off his line as Sanchez went round him and picked out Perez at the back post, but the Spaniard's goal-bound header was kept out by Clucas' arm on the line. Clucas was given a red card for the incident.\nSanchez stepped up to take the penalty, drilling a low finish into the net, which was his seventh goal against Hull in just four games.\nIt was also his 17th top-flight strike this season, making him the league's leading marksman.\nThe outlook at the top and bottom\nArsenal had lost back-to-back league games against Watford and Chelsea to leave their title challenge in disarray.\nBut the win moves them up to third in the table, nine points behind leaders Chelsea.\nFor Hull, it was an unlucky defeat, having come close to scoring in both halves, but they have now failed to find the net in 12 of their 25 games - more than any other side.\nDespite the defeat, Tigers supporters will be buoyed by the impact made by new manager Silva as his side look well-equipped for a battle to stay in the top-flight, yet they remain in the relegation zone by a single point.\nAnalysis\nFormer Hull defender Peter Swan on BBC Radio Humberside\nHull City's performance was strong, and they did really all they could. The referee's decisions have hurt Hull today, but the side are showing they have got a very real chance of staying up.\nFor the second goal, you have got to feel sorry for Clucas. His keeper has stitched him right up. It was an easy decision for Clattenburg.\nAnd do you want to know the irony? Jakupovic had probably made up the ground and was covering behind Clucas, not that the defender knew.\nMan of the match - Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal)\n'We didn't deserve this result'\nArsene Wenger speaking to Match of the Day: \"We were resilient, focused and organised, but a bit with the handbrake on as we were under pressure to win the game. In the end perhaps we were fortunate to get away with a positive result.\nHull boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport: \"The most important thing is the result. It was a very good second half. We had control of it and caused Arsenal problems.\n\"They started the game better than us and after the story of the first half they score with handball.

We should have scored more but we scored enough to win the game.\n\"To concede like this, it is very frustrating. The decisions were big time against us, every one of them. It is hard for referees but when you are on the wrong side of all decisions it makes you very, very angry. The referee was very bad today.\n\"To be fair I am already big time punished with what happened in the game. I don't think that I crossed the line, it was nothing personal. It was the fourth or fifth decision which went against us and it's hard to get over that without reacting.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"Fair play to West Ham they changed the system and caught us out a bit. It was cat and mouse and an entertaining game for the supporters.\n\"There were lots of incidents where people were falling over today and Michael Oliver got most of them right.\n\"The players have played some smashing stuff at times.

        "article_text": "Middlesbrough 0-0 Everton\nEverton extended their unbeaten Premier League run to eight games but failed to score for the first time in that streak against a resolute Middlesbrough at the Riverside.\nRomelu Lukaku went closest for the visitors in the first half but saw his low effort superbly saved by Boro keeper Victor Valdes.\nAfter the interval, Boro captain Ben Gibson's header was cleared off the line by Leighton Baines, before Valdes made another excellent stop to deny Ademola Lookman.\nEverton keeper Joel Robles then produced a stunning save from substitute Rudy Gestede's effort late on.\nA draw means the hosts are still without victory this year, having now gone eight Premier League matches without a win.\nReaction from rest of Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action from the Riverside\nA tale of two keepers\nLukaku was looking to join, or even surpass, Duncan Ferguson as Everton's record Premier League goalscorer, but the Belgium striker endured a frustrating game against an organised Boro defence and Valdes in particular.\nThe record seemed certain to fall when he was slid in on goal by Tom Davies on 30 minutes, but Valdes guessed correctly, shifting to his left to make a fine save with his legs and in the process set the tone for the rest of the game.\nThe Spaniard was called on again just before the break as he stood tall at the back post to deny Lookman from Seamus Coleman's cross. The 19-year-old Everton forward will feel he should have scored on 68 minutes when put through by Ross Barkley, but he was denied by Valdes' legs once more.\nAt that stage it seemed Valdes' exploits would secure a well-earned draw for Aitor Karanka's side, yet it will be their Spanish compatriot Robles who draws the most acclaim from this otherwise unremarkable match.\nWith just three of the 90 minutes remaining, Calum Chambers curled in an excellent cross from the right which found Gestede, who rose to power his header just under the bar, but the Toffees keeper arched back to make an outstanding save with his left hand to tip it over and maintain Everton's unbeaten run.\nBoro's blueprint\nAhead of this tie, Everton had scored 19 times in their past seven Premier League matches - as many goals as Middlesbrough have scored all season.\nThat failure to increase their attacking return, despite buying two strikers in January, remains a huge concern, but this draw exemplified the manner in which Karanka will hope to guide his side to safety this season.\nTheir defence, well-drilled by the impressive Gibson, remain miserly, having conceded only 27 times this season - the same amount as seventh-placed Everton and comfortably fewer than the rest of the teams in the bottom six.\nYet the home side also showed glimpses of more enterprising play and could not be accused of simply holding on for a draw as they continued to drive at a retreating Everton in the final 10 minutes.\nBoth then and throughout the game, that impetus came from Adama Traore, a player of tremendous potential, who frequently induced panic in the Everton defence with his pace and close-control.\nThe 21-year-old winger is still wasteful when crossing but if he can offer a more consistent final ball while retaining his other qualities, Boro have a player capable of making a difference in key games as they look to stay clear of the drop.\nMan of the match - Victor Valdes (Middlesbrough)\nBoro's 11th goalless game this season - match stats\nRonald Koeman is unbeaten in eight Premier League games for the first time at a single club (was unbeaten in 11 in September 2016 with a combination of Southampton and Everton).\nMiddlesbrough have managed to score just 11 goals at home in the top-flight this season, a league-low haul.\nMiddlesbrough are without a victory in their last eight Premier League games (D4 L4), their longest winless run in the competition since February 2009 under Gareth Southgate (14 games).\nAitor Karanka's side have failed to find the back of the net in 11 Premier League games this season; only Hull have misfired in more (12).\nOnly three sides have conceded fewer goals in the Premier League this season than Middlesbrough and Everton (27 each) - Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham.\nThe Toffees have kept clean sheets in four of their last five Premier League visits to the Riverside Stadium, winning three and drawing one those games (L1).\n'We can beat our relegation rivals' - manager reaction\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"It was a really good result and we've played really well against a very good team in really good form.\n\"The crowd once again has been amazing and I just want to tell them to keep encouraging these players, because they deserve everything.\n\"We are competing well against really good teams and if we play this way against teams who are fighting like us, then we can beat them.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"A draw is a fair result - we had the best chances in the game but they had a good header at the end.\n\"It was difficult to create because they have really good defensive organisation and they were a bit more aggressive to try to score after the second half though we were in control.\n\"A clean sheet is really positive - every one means at least one point and we usually create.\"\nWhat's next?\nMiddlesbrough host Oxford United in the FA Cup fifth round on 18 February (kick-off 15:00 GMT), before they travel to fellow strugglers Crystal Palace in the Premier League on 25 February (15:00 GMT). Everton have a break before they host Sunderland at Goodison Park on 25 February (also 15:00 GMT)."

We needed that breakthrough and it was a great goal when it came.\n\"We always felt that we would see the game through to a conclusion once we went ahead, and we restricted Palace to very few opportunities.\n\"Joe Allen times his runs well, he has an aptitude for it and it was a great finish.\n\"We are not in bad shape overall, we are doing OK but now we have to navigate our way through some very difficult games.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce:\n\"I'm disappointed for the lads. They had many moments in the game when we were in control and none more so than when Stoke scored.\n\"They scored their only shot on target in the second half. It's a 1-0 defeat again and not the point that we deserve at least.\n\"We have to keep battling on and believing. These are an honest bunch of players. Last week was a fluke, we conceded three goals in three minutes.\n\"Today the overall performance was there but the result wasn't. It's a results business and we need them fast.\n\"It's not been the results I expected. I thought it would have been easier for me to get the players to understand certain things. We all need to take more responsibility but we have to keep our chins up and graft away.\"\nCrystal Palace defender James Tomkins:\n\"We looked a lot more solid today.\n\"Stoke had one shot on target in the second half and scored but we can take positives from the game.\n\"We all need to stay positive. We all believe that we can pull together and get out of it. Nothing is going our way.\"\nAnalysis - 'Big Sam seems incapable of turning it around'\nFormer England defender Martin Keown on Final Score:\n\"There were problems at Crystal Palace before Sam Allardyce arrived, and Big Sam seems simply incapable of turning this around.\n\"The manager, who's so experienced, needs to work hard to get the fear out of his side. But I just don't see it happening now.\"\nMan of the match - Bruno Martins Indi (Stoke)\nWhat's next?\nA week off for both clubs as the FA Cup resumes, before they get back to Premier League business in a fortnight.\nPalace face a huge relegation scrap against sixth-bottom Middlesbrough at Selhurst Park on Saturday, 25 February (15:00 GMT), while Stoke go to top four-chasing Tottenham on Sunday, 26 February (13:30)."

We have to win some if we have a hope of staying up, simple as that,\" Moyes said afterwards.\nPressure lifted from Puel\nOn Thursday, Saints boss Puel said the team were \"angry\" at recent results after six league defeats from seven matches.\nThe Frenchman's side responded however with a fine confidence-boosting performance with the EFL Cup final against Manchester United just two weeks away.\nLong and Gabbiadini both missed good chances with the score at 2-0 before the late goals rounded off the win.\nGabbiadini starred with two goals but Oriol Romeu was also excellent in midfield.\nThe former Chelsea and Barcelona man had more touches (91) and completed more passes (72) than any other player and also made six interceptions and won seven aerial duels.\n'We made mistakes' - manager reaction\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"We didn't play well, not as well as last week. We made some defensive mistakes.\n\"We had a great chance to maybe move out of the bottom three had the games gone for us, but unfortunately it didn't fall for us. Southampton themselves had fragile confidence, but they got a goal off their centre-forward's arm.\n\"We played OK without creating too many clear-cut opportunities, and the more attacking changes we made the worse we became.\"\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"Today, first of all, was about the clean sheet. We showed a very good spirit and attitude in a difficult game. A good team performance showing plenty of confidence and quality.\n\"Manolo Gabbiadini is a technical player of quality who can finish well. It's great for us, and as a team it's now important to continue this work.\"\nMan of the match - Manolo Gabbiadini\nGabbiadini matches Zlatan - the best stats\nManolo Gabbiadini became the 16th player to score three goals in his first two Premier League appearances, and the first since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in August.\nThe Italian was also just the second Southampton player to score in his first two Premier League games for the club, after Henri Camara in February 2005.\nSunderland failed to score a first-half goal for the 19th time in the Premier League this season, a joint league-high with Crystal Palace.\nOnly Swansea (28) have conceded more home goals in the Premier League this season than Sunderland (24).\nAll three of Saints' away Premier League victories this season have seen them score at least three goals (3-0 vs West Ham, 3-1 vs Bournemouth).\nThe past two occasions Southampton have scored four goals in a Premier League match away from home, the other side has been relegated at the end of the campaign (Wolves in 2003-04 and Aston Villa in 2015-16).\nWhat's next?\nSunderland are heading to New York\n, external\nfor some winter training next week as they are without a game because of the FA Cup's return.\nThey next play in the Premier League on 25 February against Everton (kick-off 15:00 GMT).\nSouthampton's next game is the EFL Cup final on 26 February (kick-off 16:30) and do not play again in the league until Watford on 4 March."

With him, they tore apart Tottenham in the opening quarter.\nSpurs could not handle the speed of thought, or the speed of movement, of the home side.\nMane - who scored the fastest hat-trick in Premier League history in two minutes and 56 seconds in May 2015 - almost came close to another quickfire treble, only to be denied again by the over-exposed Lloris.\nWhile Spurs stemmed the tide after the break, the damage was already done.\nAnalysis - 'Mane is phenomenal'\nFormer Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright on Match of the Day\n\"They couldn't win without him. Mane is the one with that bit of pace to get in behind and I didn't think they were doing that recently and that's because he wasn't there.\n\"He is phenomenal. He senses the danger. Spurs couldn't deal with him.\"\nSpurs' struggles continue away from the Lane\nWhile Liverpool had not won in five games, Tottenham were playing with confidence and fluency in a 15-match streak which had seen them beaten just once.\nThe formbook was torn up at Anfield.\nSpurs had conceded just twice in their previous five league games, but were uncharacteristically porous without injured pair Danny Rose and Jan Vertonghen.\nHarry Kane was isolated up front, while midfielders Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen were virtually anonymous in the opposition half.\nSpurs managed just two shots on target as Reds keeper Simon Mignolet was largely untroubled, their frustration becoming evident after the break as four players picked up yellow cards.\nWorryingly for boss Mauricio Pochettino, his side failed to turn up again in a potentially-pivotal trip to one of their top four rivals.\nSpurs have won just twice on the road since 24 September, including defeats at Chelsea and Manchester United in addition to draws at Arsenal and Manchester City.\n\"We were poor. They were better. No complaints,\" said Pochettino.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nPost-match reaction\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"It was how we have to play against Tottenham. We had to show a reaction and it was perfect. It was an outstanding performance offensively in the first half, and defensively in the second half.\n\"We could have scored again.

        "article_text": "Burnley 1-1 Chelsea\nChelsea missed the chance to move 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League as they were held to a draw by a resilient Burnley at Turf Moor.\nThe hosts had won all four of their previous homes games without conceding but fell behind early on when Pedro finished off a sweeping attack.\nThe visitors dominated possession and it seemed only a matter of time before they added to their advantage.\nHowever, Burnley's record signing Robbie Brady - making his full debut following a January move from Norwich - equalised with a stunning free-kick.\nThe Clarets almost went ahead before the break but Thibaut Courtois superbly denied Matt Lowton from close range.\nChelsea did not have a single shot on target in the second half as Burnley took the game to the Premier League leaders, Andre Gray testing Courtois with a low drive when he was through one-on-one.\nIn the end, manager Antonio Conte will perhaps consider this a point gained as the Blues moved 10 points ahead of Tottenham. Manchester City can close the gap to eight points if they beat Bournemouth on Monday.\nBurnley, meanwhile, are 12th.\nAnalysis: How Burnley exposed Chelsea's weak spot - Gullit\nConte doesn't like Mourinho's 'joking'\nRelive Burnley's draw with Chelsea\nA blip for Blues against battling Burnley\nChelsea's away form in the Premier League is unrivalled but this was always going to be a difficult test for the Blues.\nJust two sides have a better home record than Burnley - Chelsea and Tottenham - with 28 of the Clarets' 29 points collected prior to the visit of Conte's men coming at Turf Moor.\nInitially, it looked like the visitors had the measure of their opponents, swiftly turning defence into attack to catch the Clarets out of position and open the scoring.\nTo Burnley's credit, they did not abandon a system that had brought them so much success on home soil. They allowed Chelsea to dominate possession but closed them down quickly as soon as they approached the box.\nA disciplined four-man defence had the bustling Diego Costa and the mercurial Eden Hazard under control, limiting the Blues to just two shots on target in the whole game, both of which came in the first half.\nIt was only the second time all season they have dropped points against a side outside the top six. With just Manchester City and Manchester United left to face out of the leading group, it will take an almighty collapse to deny the Blues a fifth Premier League title.\nTime to start Fabregas?\nA key factor in Chelsea's impressive season has been consistency, with Conte rarely making changes to his side unless forced to.\nAgainst Burnley, he chose the same XI that started in the 3-1 home win against Arsenal last time out. That meant Cesc Fabregas - who scored against the Gunners - had to make do with a place on the bench.\nDespite Conte recently calling Fabregas \"a genius\" and likening him to Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo, the Spanish midfielder has started just five games this season.\nN'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic were preferred in midfield against Burnley but both are defensive-minded and it quickly became evident that Chelsea were lacking the creativity of someone like Fabregas.\nOnce again Fabregas climbed off the bench but with 20 minutes remaining against a determined Burnley side, it left him little time to make an impression.\nIt could be time for Conte to give Chelsea's 'Pirlo' his chance to shine for the run-in.\nFortress Turf Moor\nBurnley's home form has all but guaranteed their Premier League status for next season, with Sean Dyche's side comfortably in mid-table and 10 points clear of the relegation zone.\nBut while their home form is as good as anyone's in the top flight, their away form has been on par with a side battling to stay up. They've collected just one point on their travels, a daunting record going into four consecutive away games.\nThe addition of Brady appears an astute signing and, along with Joey Barton, means they possess two players who are deadly from set-pieces.\nNo side have scored more goals from direct free-kicks than Burnley this season and that could represent their best chance of picking up some much-needed points on the road.\nMan of the match - Michael Keane\nWhat they said\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"Chelsea are a fine side. They are the market leaders for a reason and we limited them to two shots on target and that is tough enough.\n\"We made four or five really good chances. I am very pleased overall. The mentality here, I am pleased about the growth in the side.\n\"We are maturing as a side as individuals and as a team. You need assuredness in the Premier League. I was super impressed with our reaction to their goal. We were not disappointed or stepping on the back foot.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"It is one point and for sure we must be disappointed. We tried to win. We started very well and scored a goal and created chances to score the second goal.\n\"We tried to win but we know Burnley at home are not easy. They have taken 29 points at home. Now it is important to continue to work.\n\"I think we tried to build and do our football for sure. Burnley tried to disrupt our play. They played long balls and the second ball is not easy. It is not easy to play against this team. It is very particular. At home they are very tough.\"\nCosta goal drought continues - the stats\nBurnley have gone six top-flight games unbeaten at home for the first time since September 1975.\nChelsea (19) have scored the first goal of the game more times than any other Premier League team this season and have yet to lose (W16 D3).\nBurnley have never won a Premier League encounter against Chelsea (D2 L4).\nPedro has now scored nine times in all competitions for Chelsea this season, surpassing his total of eight in 2015-16.\nRobbie Brady is the first Premier League player to score a direct free-kick v Chelsea (in the PL) since Rickie Lambert in March 2013.\nBrady is the third Burnley player to score on his first Premier League start for the club alongside Scott Arfield v Chelsea in August 2014 and Daniel Fox v West Ham in February 2010.\nDiego Costa has failed to score in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since April-May 2016.\nWhat next?\nAfter hosting non-league Lincoln City in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday [12:30 GMT], Burnley begin a run of four away games in a row when they travel to Hull City on 25 February.\nChelsea are also in FA Cup action at the weekend. They travel to Championship side Wolves [17:30] on Saturday before hosting Swansea in the Premier League the following weekend."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 2-0 Leicester City\nPremier League champions Leicester were plunged deeper into relegation trouble as they were beaten by Swansea, whose vital victory gave their own hopes of survival an enormous lift.\nAfter a cagey start, Alfie Mawson's thumping volley and an incisive team goal finished by Martin Olsson gave the hosts a commanding 2-0 half-time lead.\nLeicester offered more resistance in the second half - substitute Islam Slimani was denied by a fine save by Lukasz Fabianski - but fell to a fifth successive defeat, increasing the pressure on manager Claudio Ranieri.\nThe Foxes, who are just one point above the relegation zone, are the only side in the top four English divisions without a league goal in 2017.\nThey are also the first reigning champions to lose five consecutive top flight matches since Chelsea in March 1956 and now find themselves embroiled in a congested relegation battle in which the bottom six teams are separated by just five points.\nReaction from the Liberty Stadium\n5 live Football Daily: Are Leicester in a relegation dogfight?\n5 live In Short: Sigurdsson is Swans' key influence\nLeicester in freefall\nWinless in the Premier League in 2017 and without a goal in their previous five league outings, Leicester entered this fixture in apparent freefall.\nGoalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel described their faltering title defence as \"embarrassing\" after last Sunday's 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United, while Wednesday's FA Cup replay win over Derby was preceded by a dreaded vote of confidence from the club's board for manager Ranieri.\nThe Italian cut a forlorn figure on the touchline at the Liberty Stadium, standing motionless as he watched his side surrender two goals in a potentially defining eight-minute spell at the end of the first half.\nThere was little Schmeichel could do to stop Mawson's brilliant swerving volley, but the goalkeeper was at fault for Swansea's second.\nAttempting to launch a counter-attack, the Dane's throw landed at the feet of Swans midfielder Tom Carroll, who started a slick one-touch passing move which involved Fernando Llorente and Gylfi Sigurdsson and ended with Olsson, whose firm strike Schmeichel should have saved.\nAs impressive as the goal was from a Swansea perspective, it was indicative of Leicester's porous defence - a far cry from the solid backline which formed the foundation for their improbable title success last season.\nSwansea's resurgence under Clement\nDespite starting the day a place below their opponents, Swansea's resurgence under new head coach Paul Clement was in striking contrast to Leicester's decline.\nThe Swans had won three of their five league games since Clement's appointment on 2 January, lifting them off the foot of the table and out of the bottom three to earn the former Derby boss the Premier League manager of the month award.\nThat accolade is meant to carry something of a curse - with managers often losing their next game after receiving the award - but Clement avoided such a jinx as he oversaw a polished performance.\nSwansea are far more organised defensively than they were under predecessor Bob Bradley, with the defence and midfield now structured and disciplined with and without the ball.\nThe home side's energetic pressing gave Leicester no time to settle, and their two brilliant goals gave them a firm foothold in the game they never looked like losing.\nA fourth win from six league games under Clement means Swansea climb up to 15th place, four points clear of the bottom three and with renewed hope of avoiding relegation.\nMan of the Match - Alfie Mawson (Swansea City)\n'Unbelievable' - the managers\nSwansea City boss Paul Clement: \"We have had a really good start and I'm very pleased with the players. We totally deserved that victory.\n\"The goal before half-time put us in strong position, we were solid all of the game. We had a couple of moments around 60/61 minutes where Leicester threatened but otherwise we were good.\"\nLeicester City boss Claudio Ranieri: \"Unbelievable. We started well. We wanted to make a good result against another team near the relegation zone. We make something good but the first shot on goal they score and then the second again. From there it was very difficult to get back.\n\"Our mind is on the Premier League. The FA Cup and Champions League is something different. We want to play well and be safe in the Premier League. Our main target is to be safe in the Premier League.\"\nWhen will Leicester score again? - The stats\nLeicester are the first reigning top-flight champions to fail to score in six consecutive league matches.\nThe Foxes have gone over 10 hours without scoring in the Premier League, 610 minutes.\nNo team in the top four tiers has won fewer points in 2017 than Leicester (one, level with Aston Villa, Coventry and Leyton Orient).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in eight goals in his last eight home Premier League games (three goals, five assists).\nNo defender has scored more Premier League goals in 2017 than Alfie Mawson (three, level with Marcos Alonso).\nLeicester have kept just two clean sheets in their last 18 Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nBy the time Leicester City start their next Premier League game, they could be bottom of the table. The Foxes host Liverpool on Monday, 27 February (20:00 GMT) - with all three teams below them in action before then.\nSwansea's next game is a trip to leaders Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday, 25 February (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 0-2 Manchester City\nManchester City moved up to second in the Premier League with a hard-fought victory over Bournemouth at Vitality Stadium.\nHaving started on the bench again, City striker Sergio Aguero appeared after just 14 minutes following an injury to Gabriel Jesus.\nBut it was Raheem Sterling who grabbed the opener from close range on the half-hour mark, having been denied by a brilliant Artur Boruc save two minutes before.\nThe hosts thought they had replied immediately, but Joshua King's strike was ruled out after he was adjudged to have pulled John Stones' shirt in the build-up.\nHarry Arter's curling shot stretched City goalkeeper Willy Caballero into a fine save, before Tyrone Mings put City's second into his own net under pressure from Aguero.\nLeroy Sane rattled the bar late on, as City extended their unbeaten run to five games in all competitions.\nRelive Manchester City's win over Bournemouth\nReaction to City's win on BBC Radio 5 live\nCan City win the title?\nPep Guardiola's side jumped three places in the table to emerge as Chelsea's closest challengers, eight points behind the leaders, who dropped points at Burnley on Sunday.\nCity face at Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 5 April. They will take inspiration from their title-winning team of 2011-12 when they clawed back the same deficit on rivals Manchester United - on that occasion with just six games remaining.\nThis time they have 13 games in which to do it as former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola looks to win a top-flight domestic title for the seventh time in the past eight seasons.\nThe Spaniard's pacy wingers were the difference on this occasion, as Sane's fleet-footedness set up Sterling for his sixth league goal of the season, before the England forward showed superb trickery to beat a defender and force Mings into a costly mistake, after pressure from Aguero.\nThe Argentine, who failed to start for the third consecutive game, was sent on after Jesus turned his ankle in the opening minutes.\nAnalysis - 'The gap is too big'\nFormer Chelsea striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live\n\"I don't think City can catch Chelsea. It's too big a gap with Chelsea performing as they have done, but it was a comfortable performance - they are brilliant going forward.\n\"I thought John Stones was outstanding and David Silva majestic. Since being thrashed 4-0 by Everton in January they have responded superbly. Things are coming together for City at the right time.\"\nBournemouth battling to survive?\nEddie Howe's men have big problems. They have not won a game in 2017, extending their winless run in all competitions to seven games.\nTheir main worry is in defence, having conceded at least two goals in each of their last 10 games, yet at the other end they tested Caballero just once in this game.\nTo make matters worse, the Cherries have picked up just one win from their last nine games and had midfielder Jack Wilshere and defender Simon Francis go off injured in the first half.\nIn their second ever season in the top-flight, Bournemouth are 14th in the table, six points above the relegation zone. With Swansea and Hull showing improvement, the south coast side could get dragged into a fight for survival should their poor form continue.\nMan of the match - Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)\n'The right result with a thousand million passes'\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"City were very good. For an away team that was a very controlled performance. Our lads gave absolutely everything, I can't ask any more of them.\n\"We need to get our bounce back - that's only going to come from a win, but I think today was a positive step.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We made a real performance. I am so pleased with how we did and especially the last 10-15 minutes, we did the right way to make the result with a thousand million passes. It is important to score goals, we are in deficit but it is OK.\"\nWhat next?\nManchester City travel to Huddersfield in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Bournemouth do not play again until 25 February when they go to West Brom (kick-off 15:00 GMT).\nHappy Monday for Guardiola - the stats\nRaheem Sterling has scored five Premier League goals against Bournemouth, the most he has against a single opponent.\nSterling has equalled his Premier League goal tally from last season for City (six in 23 this season compared to six in 31 last season).\nSterling has won 24 of 25 Premier League games in which he has scored, only losing against West Ham in September 2014.\nPep Guardiola has won all six league games he has managed on a Monday, with an aggregate score of 20-1.\nBy contrast, Bournemouth have lost all four of their Premier League games contested on a Monday, without scoring a single goal.\nBournemouth have lost all four of their Premier League games against City, scoring once and conceding 15 goals.\nThe Cherries took until the 67th minute to register their first shot on target in the game.\nOnly Leicester (one) have collected fewer Premier League points in 2017 than Bournemouth (two)."

        "article_text": "Everton 2-0 Sunderland\nEverton stretched their unbeaten league run to nine games with victory over bottom of the table Sunderland at Goodison Park.\nDespite a staunch Sunderland defence, Idrissa Gueye netted his first goal for the Toffees as he lashed Seamus Coleman's low cross beyond Jordan Pickford before the break.\nSunderland put Everton under pressure but struggled to create any chances, before Jermain Defoe's fierce effort bounced off the underside of the bar and only narrowly missed out on crossing the line.\nLukaku responded seconds later with a fine surge forward, avoiding Bryan Oviedo's tackle and slicing the ball over Pickford via a deflection to register his 60th Premier League goal for the Blues, equalling the club record with current first-team coach Duncan Ferguson.\nEverton are now four points behind sixth-placed Manchester United, while Sunderland are three points behind 17th-placed Crystal Palace.\nRelive Everton's win over Sunderland\nFollow all the Premier League reaction\nHome comforts for Everton\nEverton have lost just one of their past 15 home matches - against Liverpool in December - and have already earned more points at Goodison this season than they managed in the whole of 2015-16.\nUnchanged from their draw against Middlesbrough two weeks ago, Everton had a positivity to their play. From their four corners inside the first four minutes, to sustained pressure when Sunderland began to grow in confidence after the break, the Toffees kept creating opportunities.\nEven as Lukaku was kept quiet by John O'Shea, who often outmuscled the Everton striker, the home side kept pushing forward, before Gueye darted forward to meet Coleman's cross and put them in front. Everton's positivity nearly earned another reward minutes later as Tom Davies struck the bar on the cusp of half-time.\nLukaku had already scored seven Premier League goals against Sunderland, three of them coming when the two sides previously met in September. Despite former Everton left-back Oviedo's best efforts, Lukaku's pace proved too much for the second goal as he sprinted from the right and beat Pickford.\n\"It's been good a journey. Duncan and I work really hard, first with Roberto Martinez and now with Ronald Koeman,\" Lukaku said.\n\"They helped me to improve my game and I'm grateful to them, because without them, I wouldn't have got this far.\"\nMoyes returns to old stomping ground\nDavid Moyes spent 11 years as manager at Everton, taking the club to the Champions League in 2005, and was making his second return to Goodison since leaving in 2013.\nOn his previous visit as Manchester United manager in April 2014, Moyes oversaw a 2-0 defeat and lost his job two days later.\nAlthough he ultimately left with the same scoreline, there were undoubtedly moments of positivity from his side.\nReturning goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who had been missing since December with a knee injury, grew in confidence as the game went on. He recovered from almost allowing Ross Barkley's shot to creep over the line to producing two fantastic, sliding stops to deny Lukaku and Enner Valencia.\nSunderland's defence was also strong and forced Everton into scrappy periods, but the visitors were unable to force a goal. Another defeat means that Moyes has yet to a take a point from either of his former sides this season.\nStill bottom but positive signs for Sunderland\nSunderland had a two-week break in the aftermath of their 4-0 thrashing by Southampton on 11 February, during which time Moyes took his players to New York.\nThe defence against Southampton was sloppy but at Goodison the players kept their shape. When they were outmanoeuvred by Barkley they kept their patience and put bodies in the box to frustrate Everton's strikers.\nHowever, the Black Cats were hesitant when they counter-attack, which could be a lack of confidence having won just one of their past eight league games. Jermain Defoe barely saw the ball in the first half and his first real touch of the game saw the ball hammer into the underside of the bar.\nDespite the improved approach Sunderland have now spent 175 days in the relegation zone this season - more than any other Premier League side.\nMan of the match - Tom Davies (Everton)\nMOTD analysis\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas: \"When you look at some of the teams down at the bottom, like Hull and Swansea, they seem to have found a way of trying to get results.\n\"But when you look at Sunderland you have no idea - are they trying to get it wide and get crosses in? No. Are they playing deep and trying to counter attack? No.\n\"There style is quite simply work hard and try to get the ball to Jermain Defoe and see if he scores.\n\"If he doesn't score then they lose the game - it's all on Defoe's shoulders.\"\nSunderland's goal woes - the stats\nSince leaving Everton in summer 2013, David Moyes has lost each of his four Premier League games against the club, failing to score in each encounter.\nEverton named their youngest starting XI (25y 349d) in the Premier League at Goodison Park since May 2009 against Tottenham (25y 162d).\nAfter scoring in five consecutive league games, Sunderland have been goalless in four of their past five games.\nJordan Pickford averages 4.7 saves per game this season in the Premier League, the highest save-per-game ratio in the competition.\nSeamus Coleman has been directly involved in as many goals in his past six league games as he had in his previous 34 (four - one goal, three assists).\nIndeed, Coleman has been directly involved in 35 Premier League goals for Everton, the only defenders to be involved in more are David Unsworth (45) and Leighton Baines (76).\nWhat the managers said\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's three points, and another clean sheet. I was really pleased by the first 45 minutes, but not by the second 45. I think we dropped the tempo in the second half, and played more backwards than forwards.\n\"It was an important goal for Idrissa. During the whole week, we worked on finishing because we need more goals from our midfielders. It was a nice attack and a good finish.\n\"We know Rom is strong. If he gets the space, he uses his pace and physique. It was a great finish.\n\"There is still a gap between us and the teams above but there are still 12 games to go. You need to continue and get the momentum. The team are strong and we have a lot of clean sheets and that makes for a lot of points.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"We did ever so well to make sure it was only 1-0. We weren't good in the first half but got better in the second, we'd earned our chance, but didn't get the equaliser and gave away a poor second goal.\n\"You've got to remember the quality of Everton, where they are and what they're trying to achieve. There is a gulf in quality, but the players are giving everything they've got. If we're getting let down anywhere, we don't quite have the quality.\n\"I was disappointed we lost the first goal. We tried to frustrate the supporters. I didn't want us to concede again in the second half.\n\"I wasn't happy with how we played in the first half. Our passing was terrible. We didn't play with any confidence. But I said afterwards: 'Well done because at least in the second half you turned it round.' We've still got our time to run into form yet.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton travel to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, 5 March (13:30 GMT) while Sunderland host Manchester City on the same day (16:00 GMT)."

They have 63 points from 26 games - three more than at the same stage in 2014-15 when last crowned champions of England.\nFabregas could have ended the game with four goals on his return to the side.\nThe Spain midfielder had a goal-bound shot deflected behind shortly before he opened the scoring, was denied by former Arsenal team-mate Lukasz Fabianski and also rattled the bar.\nWith former Blues midfielder Frank Lampard watching on, Chelsea turned on the style.\nWhile it required an error from Fabianski to restore the lead, Eden Hazard's exquisite timing and pass for Costa to make it 3-1 was a delight.\nPositives in defeat for Swansea\nChelsea were forced to work hard for three points thanks to a well organised and energetic Swansea side and the Swans looked a shadow of the team that was bottom of the Premier League table five weeks ago.\nTheir four-point safety cushion at the start of the day is down to three, but boss Paul Clement will have been pleased with the way his side frustrated the runaway leaders for long spells.\nLlorente's equaliser shook Chelsea who were showing signs of frustration before Pedro made it 2-1.\nSwansea's next four games - Burnley (home), Hull City (away), Bournemouth (away) and Middlesbrough (home) - give them a chance to stay clear of the bottom three before they entertain Tottenham on 4 April.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea)\n'It was a clear handball' - what they said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"We played very well, it was a good performance, and we created many chances to score. We conceded at the end of the first half, after the time was finished, so in this case there was a bit of luck, but we showed great character in the second half.\n\"We deserved a lot to win the game, now it's important to continue in this way.\"\nSwansea City boss Paul Clement: \"Any game we play and don't win we are disappointed. Chelsea are a very good side, they have fantastic quality and that was the difference. We didn't have a lot of chances but we came in at 1-1 for half-time and for long periods we defended really well.\n\"There was a big moment with the handball, I thought Cesar Azpilicueta handled it at 1-1, it's a clear handball. That gives you a chance to go 2-1 up but three minutes later you're 2-1 down with a soft goal. Based on chances they deserved to win, but there was big moment that didn't go our way, and who knows what might have happened.\"\nMOTD analysis\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas: \"I don't think Swansea should have had a penalty as the distance from Gylfi Sigurdsson to Cesar Azpilicueta is too close and Azpilicueta's arm is already out. His hand is there because he's trying to stop Sigurdsson's run.\"\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer: \"I think it was a penalty. I think it was a deliberate movement of his hand towards the ball and I think Chelsea got away with one there. It could have been very different if the ref had given it.\n\"We've seen in recent weeks with Swansea that they made it very difficult for Liverpool at Anfield, they were unlucky to lose at Manchester City. They are very organised. The difference between Liverpool and City with this Chelsea side is the pace with which they go forward. That's why Cesc Fabregas was in the team today. He was brilliant. He's the one that started the goal off.\n\"It's topical that players are not working for mangers. The irony is last season we were sat here with a large bunch of these same Chelsea players - they weren't working for their manager and we know what happened. It's such a transformation now. We saw how brilliant they were with the ball but look at them now without it. The transformation from then to now is incredible.\"\nAnother assist for Sigurdsson - the stats\nNo player has more assists in the Premier League this season than Gylfi Sigurdsson (nine, level with Kevin de Bruyne).\nChelsea conceded in consecutive home league games for the first time under Antonio Conte.\nSwansea have conceded 26 goals in their past 10 Premier League away games, an average of 2.6 per game.\nPedro has been directly involved in 10 goals in his past nine games for Chelsea in all competitions (seven goals, three assists).\nFernando Llorente has scored nine goals in all competitions this season for Swansea, three with his head, three with his left foot and three with his right.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea have nine days to prepare for their next game away to West Ham United on Monday, 6 March (20:00 GMT). Swansea entertain Burnley on Saturday, 4 March (15:00 GMT)."

It felt like they really enjoyed the commitment from the players and really got behind us.\n\"For me it was all about the quality in the first half we continued to pepper Middlesbrough's box with crosses and shots and it came to Patrick van Aanholt and he scored with his weaker foot.\n\"We need that sort of quality if we are going to stay up and he has proved himself with four goals this season now - three for Sunderland, one for us.\"\nCrystal Palace full-back Patrick Van Aanholt: \"I lost my granddad last week. I am very pleased to get the goal for him. Obviously I am very sad to lose him but I thank him a lot.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: \"It difficult to lose but we have to keep going.\n\"This is not the first time I'm living this situation but the only thing I know is to keep working.\n\"The way we approached the game wasn't the best. I didn't need to say how important the game was to win - I think everyone knew.\"\nMOTD analysis\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer: \"It was a performance that deserved three points. Other than the 10 minutes after half-time I thought they were the much better team throughout.\n\"They understood what each other's roles were, how they were going to play the game. They just did not hesitate at all to get balls into the box. They knew, I think, that they had to do that.\n\"That was their first thought - can we hit the big man, even if there's no bodies around him? Second half, that didn't change either. They thoroughly deserved the three points today and it was three massive points for them.\n\"We say the same thing every week about Boro - 19 goals, 26 games, they haven't won since mid-December, not won in nine. They're in a slump and they're in big trouble, I think.\"\nCapital punishment for Boro - the stats\nPalace ended their run of five home league defeats in a row, the longest such run by any team in the Premier League this season.\nMiddlesbrough remain on the current longest winless run in the Premier League, failing to win any of their past nine games, drawing four and losing five.\nSam Allardyce enjoyed his first win in his past 10 Premier League games against Middlesbrough (drawn six, lost three).\nAitor Karanka's Boro side have scored a league-low 19 goals, while their top-flight games have produced a total of 47 goals, 12 fewer than any other team in the competition this season.\nMiddlesbrough have failed to win on any of their past 13 Premier League visits to London (drawn four, lost nine), last winning in the capital at Fulham 2-1 in August 2007.\nPatrick van Aanholt is the first player this season to score for two clubs in the Premier League (excluding own-goals), also netting for Sunderland.\nVan Aanholt has scored eight goals in the Premier League since the start of last season - a joint-high for a defender (excluding penalties), with team-mate Scott Dann also netting eight.\nYohan Cabaye registered a Premier League assist for the first time in his past 48 Premier League appearances (since 3 October 2015 against West Brom).\nWhat next?\nCrystal Palace travel to West Brom next Saturday (kick-off 15:00 GMT), while Middlesbrough go to Stoke at the same time."

West Brom later stating the defender is fine following his collision with Tyrone Mings.\nDespite dominating possession, Eddie Howe's side failed to find a vital equaliser - Ben Foster making two superb saves in added time to ensure Bournemouth continue their slide into a relegation battle.\nFor the hosts, substitute James McClean also saw his effort well saved by Boruc late on, as the impressive Baggies have now reached 40 points for the season.\nReaction to all of Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action from The Hawthorns\nSafe before March\nBarring a remarkable downturn in form, West Brom look firmly on course to achieve their best-ever Premier League points total this season.\nTheir current record stands at 49 when the Baggies finished eighth at the end of the 2012-13 campaign under Steve Clarke, but have 12 games remaining to surpass that total.\nClarke's side had the benefit of Romelu Lukaku's 17 league goals that year, whereas this vintage have a more unlikely source in 37-year-old centre-back McAuley, who looks keen and capable of playing to 40 in his current form.\nThe veteran capped his 500th game in English football with his seventh strike in all competitions this season - drawing him level with Salomon Rondon as West Brom's top scorer - before marshalling his defence expertly in a tighter second half.\nIn truth, he will likely never score an easier goal as Boruc suffered the indignity of managing to punch the ball behind him from a corner before it rolled down his back and into McAuley's path.\nThe hosts were fortunate with Dawson's deflected leveller too, but that should not detract from another fine performance as they claimed a fifth victory in their last eight league games.\nIndefensible\nThe plot points were different but this was an all-too familiar tale for Bournemouth as their miserable defence once again made sure they remain without a win in 2017, having now conceded 18 goals in their last six Premier League games.\nDaniels' deflection was unlucky but Dawson should never have been allowed the space to move up from right-back unchecked into a shooting position.\nBournemouth looked petrified every time they conceded a corner - the hosts had eight in total - as Jonny Evans, Dawson and McAuley all tormented their marker, with the latter also hitting the crossbar from a looping header.\nAs woeful as the visitors looked at set pieces, they also took bizarre risks in open play, Steve Cook perhaps lucky to avoid a red card as he barged Rondon off the ball as the striker threatened to beat Boruc.\nAll this makes the club's failure to bring in any more defenders in the January transfer window even more puzzling, while Nathan Ake's departure back to parent club Chelsea hangs like a curse over Howe's beleaguered side.\nAndrew Surman and Harry Arter also failed to provide the protection that Jake Livermore offered for the hosts, while in Boruc, the Cherries have a goalkeeper whose performances grow evermore inconsistent.\nFantastic Foster\nIn contrast to Boruc's dismal showing, West Brom keeper Foster had little to do until two excellent saves in added time.\nThe first was somewhat straightforward as he stayed tall to flick substitute Lys Mousset's curling effort over the bar with his right hand.\nThe second saw him scramble across to his right, just managing to tip Mings' glancing header behind.\nSurman also failed to test the Baggies keeper when well placed late on as Bournemouth created more chances in the final five minutes than the preceding 45, but three points was due reward for Foster's efforts.\nMan of the match - Jake Livermore (West Brom)\nManager reaction\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"It's a great achievement to get 40 points by this time, so we're all pleased.\n\"It's been a great season so far, but we don't want to let it go flat.\n\"Look at Claudio Ranieri and Leicester - as soon as you become complacement, this game has an unbelievable way of kicking you up the backside.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"I thought we did enough to get a point during the whole game - we dominated possession but perhaps didn't do enough with that. I'm disappointed.\n\"When you're not wining games there are errors from the team - it's not one person, we need to take collective responsibility.\n\"If we come back from this - and I'm sure we will - then we'll be a much better team for it.\n\"Destiny is in our own hands and we've got to force it our way.\"\nMOTD analysis\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer: \"Another individual error from a Bournemouth player, this time the keeper, gifted the goal to Gareth McAuley. It has happened too many times this season. There's a bit of traffic but that's no excuse for that. West Brom are a threat but Boruc has to do better. It's a simple chance and it's gifted them a goal.\n\"West Brom are having one hell of a season. The team have been brilliant for Tony Pulis.\"\nWest Brom fastest to 40 under Pulis - match stats\nTony Pulis has seen a side under his management reach the 40-point mark in February within the Premier League for the first time ever.\nCraig Dawson's goal was the first scored for WBA in the Premier League by an English player since April 25th 2016 (also by Craig Dawson).\nRyan Fraser has won a league-high four penalties this season in the Premier League.\nBournemouth have scored three penalties in the Premier League in 2017 already - all coming in the opening 20 minutes of games.\nGareth McAuley has scored in successive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career. In fact, it's the first time he's scored more than once in a month within the competition.\nArtur Boruc has made seven errors leading to goals in the Premier League since the start of 2015-16; more than any other player in this period.\nOnly Leicester City (1) have collected fewer Premier League points in 2017 than Bournemouth (2).\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom host Crystal Palace at The Hawthorns on Saturday 4 March, with kick-off at 15:00 GMT. Bournemouth travel to Manchester United on the same day, kicking-off at 12:30 GMT."

        "article_text": "Hull City 1-1 Burnley\nHull City missed the chance to move out of the Premier League bottom three as they drew with a Burnley side who remain without an away league win this season.\nAfter a quiet first half, the hosts went ahead through Tom Huddlestone's penalty after Burnley defender Michael Keane handled in the penalty area.\nHowever, the lead only lasted four minutes before Keane blasted in an equaliser following a corner.\nBurnley ended the game with 10 men as Ashley Barnes was sent off in injury time for two bookable offences, but the hosts could not find a winner.\nIt means Burnley have now only picked up two points from 12 away Premier League matches this season, the worst record in the top-flight.\nReaction from all of Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action from the KCOM Stadium\nA missed opportunity for Hull?\nA win for Hull would have taken them out of the bottom three for the first time since Marco Silva became the club's manager in January.\nFor a brief spell they looked on course for the victory that would have taken them up to 16th, but Burnley's equaliser dropped the Tigers back down to 19th.\nThe hosts had been wasteful in the first half with Dieumerci Mbokani, who remains without a goal in 11 appearances since joining the club on loan from Dynamo Kiev in August, heading over from close range.\nKamil Grosicki also misjudged a lobbed attempt when Tom Heaton was out of position and put his shot too high.\nHuddlestone's penalty put Hull ahead, but Silva was angry with what he called \"a lack of focus\" when they left Keane unmarked at the back post, and he had enough time to take the ball down on his chest and blast in the equaliser.\nWas it a penalty?\nBurnley were unhappy with the awarding of Hull's penalty, which came when Keane handled as the players jostled for position in the penalty area as a left-wing corner came across.\nThe away side argued that Hull's Harry Maguire had pushed Keane towards the ball, causing the handball. Barnes led the protests and was booked for dissent, before he was shown a second yellow in injury time when he left a flailing arm into the face of Andrea Ranocchia.\nIn an interview with BBC Sport, Keane expressed his disbelief that the penalty had been awarded.\nHe said: \"There is no way it was deliberate. The lad pushed me in the back and it moved me towards the ball.\n\"Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't and we didn't. If we had lost it would've been very harsh.\"\nLike Hull, Burnley had also been wasteful in front of the goal when the game was goalless. Barnes and Andre Gray shot just wide and Ben Mee's close-range header was fumbled on to the top of the crossbar by home goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic.\nNevertheless, Burnley, who move up to 11th, battled well to earn only their second away point of the season.\nThey have chances to earn more in their next three league games as they only play away from home in March - at Swansea, Liverpool and Sunderland.\nMan of the match - Tom Huddlestone (Hull City)\nA rare away goal for Burnley - the stats\nHull have only lost one of their past 11 home matches in all competitions (won five, drew five, lost one).\nHull have picked up more points under Marco Silva in their last six Premier League games (eight) than their previous 18 games under former boss Mike Phelan (seven).\nBurnley have only scored six goals in their 12 away league games this season, while they have conceded 25.\nOnly Liam Noble (six) has been sent off more times in English league football than since August 2011 than Ashley Barnes (five).\nBurnley are now unbeaten in their six Premier League games against Hull, winning four and drawing two.\nBurnley's only other away league point this season came with a goalless draw away at Manchester United on 29 October.\n'We are fighting until May' - what they said\nHull City boss Marco Silva said: \"Of course it is frustrating. It was a tough, tough game. It is not easy to play against Burnley, it was a balanced game, we had good chances and when you score it is impossible to suffer a goal like we conceded from a set piece.\n\"It is important to be focused, and we lost our focus from a set piece and they scored. At this level it is impossible to give the opposition something.\n\"We need to continue to do our work and keep our organisation. Today it is one point more - three points would have been better but we are fighting until May. It is clear our team and fans believe and I see a team with promise.\n\"We need to take points in every game, no-one believed we would beat Liverpool so the fight continues.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"Happy. A lot has been made of our away form. In the first half we made good opportunities but we lacked quality.\n\"To go 1-0 down and come back with the amazing character of the team is very good. I thought the penalty was very harsh.\n\"I don't want the red card to overshadow a good point, it was a deserved point.\n\"There have been a lot of question marks over our away performances but there was plenty of endeavour and a good feel to the group today.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley continue their run of four successive away games with a trip to Swansea on Saturday, 4 March (15:00 GMT). At the same time, Hull play away at 2015-16 champions Leicester City."

He's one of the best strikers in the world. He deserves it because he's a great professional.\n\"It was a fantastic performance. It was a good response from the team.\n\"Ten points is a big gap [to Chelsea] - but we keep going and believe. We try to put on pressure.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"The game was done in the first half. The manner of the goals we conceded was not good enough at any level.\n\"The second half was zero conceded and I guess that's a positive but that's because Spurs didn't push.\n\"We were too passive and not doing enough to stop balls going to our goal. Clearly Spurs are very good but if you allow teams time and space then good players will hurt you.\"\nKane brings up his century - match stats\nIn scoring a hat-trick, Harry Kane went past 100 goals in his club career (102) - with 86 of those coming for Tottenham.\nKane's hat-trick was his fourth in the Premier League for Spurs - no player in club history has registered more in the competition (Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe both have three).\nMark Hughes has won only one of his past 13 Premier League games against opponents who began the day occupying a top-six position (D2 L10) - they have conceded at least three goals in nine of those 13 games.\nSpurs scored four first-half goals in a Premier League match for the first time since February 2012 (v Newcastle).\nWhat's next?\nTottenham host Everton at White Hart Lane on Sunday 5 March, with kick-off at 13:30 GMT.

        "article_text": "Leicester City 3-1 Liverpool\nLeicester produced a superb display in their first game following the sacking of Claudio Ranieri, moving out of the Premier League bottom three as two goals from Jamie Vardy and a Danny Drinkwater strike saw off Liverpool.\nIt was a much-improved display from the Foxes under caretaker boss Craig Shakespeare, who took over after the departure of the man who led them to last season's remarkable title triumph.\nThe first strike was straight from the 2015-16 playbook as Vardy collected Marc Albrighton's precise long pass before racing clear and finishing low past Simon Mignolet to score his second goal in a week.\nThe second was an absolute cracker from Vardy's England team-mate Drinkwater, who showed superb technique to lash home his first goal of the campaign from outside the box following a clearance from a long throw.\nAnd Vardy sealed the win with a glancing header from Christian Fuchs' cross in the second half before Philippe Coutinho stroked home a consolation goal.\nThe goals were the first the Foxes have scored in the league in 2017 and ended a run of five straight top-flight defeats in spectacular fashion.\nLiverpool - who would have climbed to third with a victory - have now lost five of their past seven matches in all competitions.\nPhil McNulty: A Foxes triumph tinged with regret\nRelive Leicester's victory over Liverpool\nFootball Daily podcast: Uncomfortable to watch Leicester win - Savage\nShakespeare draws a performance\nRanieri's name was everywhere at the King Power - in pre-game conversations, on banners and in chants - as was his face, courtesy of paper masks worn by some Foxes supporters.\nThe 65-year-old Italian has left an indelible imprint on the club with last season's astonishing success.\nHowever, the inconvenient truth for many is that he was overseeing statistically one of the worst title defences in English top-flight history - one that has left Leicester facing the prospect of become the first reigning champions to be relegated since Manchester City in 1938.\nAmid suggestions the players had stopped playing for their former boss, there was an element of damned if you do win and damned if you don't in this game.\nHowever, the need for victory was paramount and they were excellent from start to finish as Shakespeare drew a committed, energetic and ruthless display to improve his chances of steering the club to safety - and possibly succeeding Ranieri on a permanent basis.\nThe champions also have players in form. Vardy now has three goals in two games and Kasper Schmeichel remains an authoritative presence in goal, as he demonstrated with two big saves to deny Coutinho and Emre Can in the first half and Adam Lallana after the break.\nDeja vu for Liverpool\nWhile Leicester have embarked on a demanding February comprising five matches, Liverpool have taken to the field just twice this month and came into this game off the back of a 16-day break, during which they took a training trip to La Manga in Spain.\nBut instead of looking refreshed, the Reds looked rusty throughout and were simply unable to make an impression on a night when they were always likely to be second on the bill.\nJust over 12 months ago, Jurgen Klopp's side were undone on this ground as a Vardy-inspired Leicester consigned them to a defeat that left them 16 points off top spot in eighth.\nThey are now 14 points behind leaders Chelsea in fifth but look as far away from challenging for the title as they did in 2016.\nGoalscorer Coutinho was their only consistent attacking threat, while the defence continues to look shaky - especially with Lucas masquerading at centre-back - and their midfield lacked the industry and bite to compete in the absence of injured captain Jordan Henderson.\nThey now have a real challenge on their hands if they are to finish in the top four and seal a return to the Champions League next season.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nWhat the managers said\nLeicester caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare : \"I could see in their eyes that they were up for the fight in the warm-up.\n\"The professionalism of the players has never been questioned by me. Having taken training with them, I know the the criticism has hurt and perhaps there was a little more fire in the belly because of that.\n\"They know they are guilty of underperforming - but this is only one result and we must build on that.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"The language issues become a bit harder when you lose. It's hard to find the right words.\n\"It's not that Leicester were over-aggressive tonight, I think we were not physical enough.\n\"We knew how Leicester would play, go back to their roots. We could have done much better. We let them be Leicester of last year - that's our fault.\n\"We should get criticised. This inconsistency makes absolutely no sense.\"\nNdidi does Kante impression - the stats you need to know\nLeicester have won all six of their Premier League games in which they have scored first this season, the only 100% record in the division.\nFour of Liverpool's five Premier League defeats this season have been against clubs who started the match in the relegation zone (also Burnley, Swansea and Hull City).\nVardy's goal was Leicester's first in the top flight since 31 December, ending a run of 637 minutes without finding the net in the competition.\nCoutinho's strike was his first in 12 games for Liverpool - he last scored against Watford in November.\nWilfred Ndidi made 11 tackles on Monday. Only former Leicester midfielder N'Golo Kante - now at Chelsea - has made more in a Premier League match this season (14 against Liverpool in January).\nOnly in 2012, when they picked up five points, have Liverpool won fewer points from their opening seven Premier League games of a calendar year than the six they have so far in 2017 (level with 1993).\nWhat next?\nLeicester host another relegation-threatened side on Saturday when Hull visit the King Power Stadium (15:00 GMT kick-off), followed by the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Sevilla at 19:45 on 14 March.\nLiverpool host Arsenal in Saturday's 17:30 kick-off and follow that up with another home game the following Sunday when Burnley travel to Anfield (16:00)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 Bournemouth\nManchester United remained sixth in the Premier League with a draw against 10-man Bournemouth in a match that had two unpleasant incidents involving Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Tyrone Mings.\nBoth occurred towards the end of the first half after the players had earlier been warned by referee Kevin Friend for an off-the-ball incident.\nFirst, Mings appeared to land on the back of the head of the United forward as he lay on the ground, and then from a corner, Ibrahimovic elbowed the Cherries defender.\nThat last incident was witnessed by Mings' team-mates, including midfielder Andrew Surman who pushed the Swedish striker to the ground.\nHe was consequently shown a yellow card, which Friend realised was his second after a long delay. The official eventually pulled out his red card.\nThat followed a period of United domination, and they took the lead when Marcos Rojo diverted Antonio Valencia's strike past keeper Artur Boruc.\nThe visitors - with only one win in 11 - then grabbed a shock equaliser when Joshua King converted from the spot after Phil Jones had brought down Marc Pugh.\nUnited then won a penalty in the 71st minute when Adam Smith handled Paul Pogba's flick. But from the resulting spot-kick Boruc, magnificent during the match, dived to his right to keep out Ibrahimovic's effort.\nBournemouth hung on to earn their first league point in five games, but it is the incidents involving Ibrahimovic and Mings that will dominate the back pages.\nRelive the action as it happened\nMan Utd 'won't cry' over Zlatan incidents\nFour incidents in five frantic minutes\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe arrived at Old Trafford feeling the effects of a stomach bug - and he would have felt more queasy after what he witnessed near the end of the first half.\nSurman's sending off was the culmination of the bruising on and off-the-ball battle between Mings and Ibrahimovic.\nBoth had been talked to by Friend moments after the United striker had appeared to push the defender to the ground early on in the opening period. Neither were punished then, nor were they punished just before the break following the two incidents.\nThe first was highlighted by a TV replay when Mings, in hurdling United captain Wayne Rooney after tackling him, landed his boot on the top of Ibrahimovic, who was also lying on the turf.\nFrom the corner, Ibrahimovic, again closely marked by Mings, appeared to elbow the defender in the face.\nA melee then followed which resulted in a yellow card for Surman - his second - for a push on Ibrahimovic.\nIn an unsavoury end to the half, Bournemouth assistant Jason Tindall was also sent off for his protestations over the incident during the corner.\nUnited fail to take advantage of dominance\nIf it was not for the brilliant saves of Boruc, United would have run away with this match.\nThe Cherries had conceded 51 goals in the league coming into the fixture - more than any other club - and it could have been 57 inside the first 22 minutes.\nBoruc, with a strong sun in his eyes in the first half, made great saves to keep out strikes from Pogba, Rooney and then Anthony Martial. United also twice went close through Ibrahimovic.\nAnd in the second half the Polish keeper pushed away another Pogba effort before he capped off his excellent display with a brilliant penalty save.\nFrom United's point of view it will be a match in which they had 20 chances and only managed to convert one.\nMan of the match - Artur Boruc (Bournemouth)\nIbrahimovic's first miss since 2015 - key stats\nManchester United's unbeaten Premier League run has been extended to 17 games (W9 D8), and they have not conceded more than once in a game during that run [10 goals conceded].\nIbrahimovic missed a penalty in a league game for the first time since September 2015 for Paris St-Germain against Guingamp - he had scored six consecutively before his failure today.\nArtur Boruc was the first goalkeeper to save a penalty against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Premier League since Boaz Myhill in May 2015.\nBoruc has saved four of the past seven penalties he has faced in the Premier League.\nJoshua King was only the 14th player in Premier League history to score a penalty at Old Trafford for the opposing side.\nKing's goal was Bournemouth's only shot on target in the entire match.\nBournemouth have scored all seven of their Premier League penalties this season, more than any other side.\nRojo scored his first Premier League goal in his 54th appearance\nUnited have managed 20-plus shots without winning four times in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nWhat's next?\nUnited are at FC Rostov next Thursday in the Europa League last 16, before they face Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final a week on Monday.\nThey next play in the league, after the Europa League return leg, when they travel to Middlesbrough on Sunday, 19 March.\nThe Cherries have a less busy schedule. They host West Ham in the league next Saturday."

The Hornets failed to clear a loose ball and it came out to an unmarked Tadic in the 18-yard box, who drilled his shot into the bottom corner.\nRedmond then put the Saints into a deserved lead in first-half stoppage time.\nIt was a lovely worked goal, started by the England under-21 winger who played the ball to James Ward-Prowse. He in turn found Tadic on the right, who then cut back for Redmond to squeeze his shot into the far post.\nGabbiadini continues his goal glut\nManolo Gabbiadini was Saints' most in-form player going into this game, having scored five goals in his first three games since a \u00a314m move from Napoli in January.\nThe Italy striker, who scored twice in the cup final, should have netted on 56 minutes as he outstripped Miguel Britos down the left flank, cut inside but then wasted a golden opportunity.\nLinking with the excellent Tadic and Redmond, the Saints front three caused Watford plenty of danger on the break.\nIt was a surprise when Okaka levelled and the Italy striker should have put Watford ahead five minutes later with a two-on-one. Just 30 seconds later and Watford were punished as Gabbiadini scored his sixth for the club.\nHeurelho Gomes spilt Sofiane Boufal's shot and Gabbiadini pounced to become the first Saints player to score in his first three Premier League appearances for the club.\nOkaka's wastefulness was punished further by Redmond who lashed a shot past Gomes, just a minute later.\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond\n'It was important to get the result'\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"I'm unhappy about the third Watford goal, but it was important to get a good result after our big disappointment against Manchester United.\n\"It was important my players showed their character to come back from a goal down, they played directly, we kept concentration and we recovered and played good football and scored beautiful goals.\n\"Now we have two weeks without a game and this is difficult.\"\nOn Gabbiadini: \"It was important to find a player who can give the team a good efficiency, a clinical edge. It is interesting for the confidence of the team and other strikers.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"There were some bad defensive mistakes, but I would not say it was a bad performance, we deserved the draw and had a chance to go for the win to make it 3-2, but they went on the counter-attack and they managed to score and make it 3-2 and then 4-2.\"\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton's next game is a visit to Tottenham on 19 March. That will mean the win over Watford is the only Premier League game the Saints will have played between 11 February and the trip to White Hart Lane. This is due to games against Arsenal and Manchester United being postponed.\nWatford face a trip to Crystal Palace on 18 March."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 3-1 Hull City\nLeicester City came from behind to beat Hull City as Foxes caretaker boss Craig Shakespeare gained his second win from his two games in charge.\nThe 2015-16 champions went behind when Sam Clucas, who began his career at Leicester, scored from close range from Kamil Grosicki's pull-back.\nBut Christian Fuchs equalised after good work down the left wing from Jamie Vardy.\nLast season's PFA Player of the Year Riyad Mahrez scored his first league goal since November, a low 18-yard strike, before Tom Huddlestone headed into his own net to seal a deserved victory for Leicester and Shakespeare.\nRelive Leicester City's win over Hull City as it happened\nAnalysis and reaction from the Premier League matches\nShakespeare's perfect job interview continues\nCraig Shakespeare is set to hold talks with the club's board next week to discuss whether he should get the manager's job on a full-time basis after the club sacked title-winner Claudio Ranieri last month.\nAnd it was another perfect job interview from Shakespeare as he has returned Leicester to playing in a way similar to last season.\nThey have gone back to basics with a 4-4-2 formation and Jamie Vardy, who was outstanding throughout, given service and able to run on to passes and terrorise the defence with his pace. Mahrez was also given a free role and licence to drop deep and influence the game in a way that led to his 18-goal tally last season.\nRanieri will question whether his players stopped playing for him, as this win, with the same group of players, followed a similar 3-1 victory against Liverpool on Monday.\nNevertheless, the result eases the Foxes relegation fears - taking them five points above the relegation zone.\nThe only surprise was that Hull took the lead against the run of play after Leicester had wasted three early chances to score.\nBut the Foxes were only behind for 13 minutes when Fuchs finished with a shot from eight yards out after Vardy's pace had created the opportunity down the left flank.\nMahrez jinked to create space on the edge of the penalty area to give Leicester the lead, although Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic will be unhappy at being beaten at his near post with the low strike.\nLeicester's third goal was more fortunate, with the ball inadvertently bouncing off Hull captain Tom Huddlestone after Wilfred Ndidi flicked on a corner.\nMissed chance haunts Hull\nHull City manager Marco Silva had no complaints about the result, calling it \"fair\", but he and the club's supporters will rue a missed chance to go ahead early in the second half when the game was level at 1-1.\nCentre-half Harry Maguire, tipped for an England call-up by Silva, flicked an effort at goal, and with Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel beaten, the ball rebounded off the post.\nSilva has been in charge of Hull since January and, despite winning eight points from his seven Premier League games, has never seen his side out of the relegation zone.\nThey are now four points behind 17th-placed Crystal Palace and face a must-win game next time out when they entertain fellow strugglers Swansea City.\nMan of the match - Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\nShakespeare v Ranieri - the match stats\nLeicester have scored twice as many Premier League goals in their two games under Craig Shakespeare (six) as they did in their last 10 matches under Claudio Ranieri (three).\nShakespeare has also collected as many wins in his first two matches as Ranieri mustered in his last 16 league games (two).\nThis was Leicester's first win after conceding the first goal in a Premier League game since October 2015 when they beat West Brom.\nSam Clucas netted his first ever Premier League goal in his 26th appearance.\nClucas' goal was Hull's first shot on target - they also scored with their first shot on target in their last Premier League game against Burnley.\nRiyad Mahrez has scored in four of his five appearances against Hull in all competitions (four goals).\nMahrez scored his first Premier League goal from open play since April 2016 against Swansea, ending a run of 27 games without one.\nNo team has scored more own goals than Hull (four) in the Premier League this season.\n'It is the Mahrez of old' - what they said\nLeicester caretaker boss Craig Shakespeare: \"We spoke to the players before the game, they showed resilience and character. It was against the run of play to go 1-0 down, but to bounce back showed the resilience in our side.\n\"Riyad Mahrez has been frustrated with himself. We told him to go out there and be himself. It is the Mahrez of old with the goal he scored.\n\"Results give players confidence. Back-to-back wins will give confidence for the last 11 games of the season.\n\"In terms of our points, it has been a turnaround. Everyone looked at the game against Liverpool on Monday and to get the three points under pressure was important but to back that up with another win was vitally important.\nOn whether he will get the job full-time, Shakespeare replied: \"I am comfortable. We have a few days away now. I have been kept informed. I am told we will have a chat at the end of next week.\n\"We know the last 11 games will have twist and turns. We need to take care of ourselves.\"\nHull City boss Marco Silva: \"It is good when you play well and are close to the result, but most importantly we need to take points.\n\"We were better in the first half and scored from a counter-attack. They had a good reaction, but after half-time, the score was fair.\n\"We had two good chances in the second half, but they ended up scoring two. We did not put the ball into the net.\n\"The numbers are not good for us, that is clear. We need to fight but when you have chances to score, that is what makes the difference.\n\"We need to always fight, but we can rest and analyse the game now. We have to prepare for the next game against Swansea.\"\nWhat next?\nLeicester are set to go on a four-day trip to Dubai as they are not in action next weekend. Their next action comes in the Champions League on Tuesday, 14 March. They play Sevilla at home in the second leg of their last-16 tie, with the Spanish side leading 2-1 after the first leg.\nHull have a Premier League game at home to Swansea on Saturday, 11 March, in a game that could be vital for their hopes of staying in the top flight."

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 0-2 Crystal Palace\nBrilliant second-half strikes from Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend earned Crystal Palace victory at West Brom which saw them move out of the Premier League bottom three.\nZaha's 55th-minute goal was only the second effort on target in the match, but it was worth savouring.\nYohan Cabaye played a sublime cross-field pass for his team-mate on the left of the area. The former Manchester United player chested down the ball and then struck a low, angled effort past keeper Ben Foster.\nBut better was to come six minutes from time.\nTownsend picked up the ball from the left of his own area and ran to the opposition box, before shifting past marker Gareth McAuley in the area and striking a low drive past Foster.\nHe looked exhausted after the lung-busting late run, but it assured Palace of a very important three points in their fight to stay up.\nRelive the action from The Hawthorns\nZaha effort brings match to life\nThere were only five shots on target during this largely uneventful spectacle at The Hawthorns. The closest either team came to scoring in the opening 45 minutes was when Christian Benteke's header was cleared off the line by Chris Brunt.\nIt needed something special to break the deadlock - step forward Zaha.\nHe had drifted in and out of the game, with his best contribution up until the goal coming from a teasing cross that McAuley did well to clear.\nThen came the goal. Cabaye found Zaha with a pass any quarter-back would be proud of. The Palace winger controlled the ball, first time, before drilling into the far corner.\nThat strike would have been a worthy winner, but it was trumped by Townsend's effort.\nThe winger, who moments earlier had a shot blocked by Foster, ran the full length of the pitch before applying a firm finish, which went in from a slight deflection off Jonny Evans.\nOne to forget for West Brom\nTony Pulis' side were expected to come away from the match with their fourth league win in six, but neither striker Salomon Rondon nor his fellow attackers produced much to set the home fans' pulses racing.\nVenezuelan Rondon twice got into goalscoring positions early in the first half, but was prevented from having an effort on target by the alert Mamadou Sakho.\nOther than those two moments, the only other incident that brought cheer from the home fans was when referee Mike Jones was accidentally sent to the turf by West Brom midfielder Jake Livermore.\nMan of the match - Andros Townsend\n'New players have made a difference' - what they said\nPalace boss Sam Allardyce: \"This is a much bigger win than last weekend against Middlesbrough because to put back-to-back wins together here against West Brom at the Hawthorns is a big statement.\n\"It gives the players the confidence to push on and get out of the position we're in. It was a quality performance and we deserved the three points.\n\"In terms of catching up on games and points, back-to-back wins make such a big difference. We're working in that bottom-seven league and trying to win that.\n\"We did the basics so well and the quality of both goals topped it. West Brom barely had a shot on goal.\n\"I said the new players would make a difference and they have done that.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"No excuses today. We weren't at it right from the start. Congratulations to Palace.\n\"I'm not going to criticise the players because they have been fantastic this year. We've had an off day and I hope that is all it is.\n\"Why was it an off day? If I knew I'd be a genius. We've worked hard and trained hard this week. We were tepid right from the very beginning.\nOn whether his side are guilty of switching off mentally after reaching the 40-point mark: \"Complacency is the most annoying word in the dictionary. It is human nature to switch off a little bit sometimes. People are people - sometimes they have good days, sometimes they have bad days.\"\nA first for Palace in 44 years\nPalace have won successive Premier League games for the first time since September.\nThe Eagles have picked up as many points in their last three league away games as they had done in their previous nine (six points).\nWest Brom have lost their first ever Premier League game against Palace at the Hawthorns after two wins and two draws in their previous four.\nPalace's first win at West Brom in the top-flight since a 4-0 win in February 1973.\nZaha has been directly involved in more goals this season than his last three Premier League seasons combined (five goals; six assists).\nYohan Cabaye has bagged assists in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2012. Before this run he failed to record an assist in 47 Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom are at Everton next Saturday and Palace have a two-week break before they are at home to Watford on Saturday, 18 March."

Hughes is also yet to give new signing Saido Berahino a league start.\nFormer Inter and Werder Bremen man Arnautovic linked well with Crouch, and the touch for his first goal was one of a player brimming with confidence.\nThe Austrian was a thorn in the Middlesbrough side almost immediately from kick-off, teeing up team-mate Ramadan Sobhi only to see the Egypt winger strike the bar.\nBoro fire another blank\nMiddlesbrough's lack of goals are turning into something of a crisis for boss Karanka, who watched his side drop into the bottom three for the first time this season.\nA league-low 19 goals has seen them muster only four wins all campaign and it is perhaps no surprise that Boro have not found the net in four games, plus their shooting accuracy is only better than West Ham's.\nKaranka opted to drop top scorer Alvaro Negredo in favour of January signing Rudy Gestede, but the Benin forward was isolated as Boro's midfield failed to support their lone striker.\nFellow new arrival Patrick Bamford did not even make the bench.\nBoro's early-season form was built on a solid defence and they have conceded fewer goals than any other team in the bottom half, but after the loss of centre-back Daniel Ayala to injury early on it was easy pickings for Stoke.\nMan of the match - Marko Arnautovic (Stoke City)\n'We had something to prove' - what they said\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"It was important to bounce back.

We could have won more comprehensively.\n\"When he times those runs in behind he is very difficult to knock off his stride, he's a big guy with lots of power. He's got that potential.\"\nMiddlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"In this kind of moment we need to be positive. We have to know we have done good things so far.\n\"We have to keep believing in this group of players. Until the last day we will keep fighting.\n\"We are in the bottom three and we need to work harder to leave those positions.\"\nHome comforts for Stoke - key stats\nStoke have lost only one of their past 12 home Premier League games.\nMarko Arnautovic scored his first home Premier League goal in 308 days.\nArnautovic has scored 21 Premier League goals, equalling the record scored by an Austrian [Paul Scharner] in the competition.\nMiddlesbrough have won one of their past 27 away Premier League matches.\nBoro have now failed to score in a league-high 13 matches this season and have not found the net in six of their past eight Premier League games.\nWhat next?\nStoke face Manchester City at the Etihad in the Premier League on Wednesday, kick-off 20:00 GMT, before hosting Chelsea 10 days later.\nMiddlesbrough host both Manchester clubs in the next two weeks.

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-1 Arsenal\nLiverpool secured a vital advantage over Arsenal in the battle for a place in the Premier League's top four with a well-deserved win at Anfield.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger gambled by leaving Alexis Sanchez - his leading scorer with 17 Premier League goals - on the bench but the ploy failed miserably as Liverpool took control by the break.\nRoberto Firmino's far-post finish put Liverpool ahead after nine minutes and Sadio Mane confirmed their superiority with an emphatic strike just before half-time.\nSanchez, predictably, emerged as a substitute at the start of the second half and set up a goal for Danny Welbeck that gave Arsenal hope but Georginio Wijnaldum struck on the break deep into injury-time to seal Liverpool's win.\nLiverpool are now up to third, level with Manchester City on 52 points - but Arsenal are now in fifth trailing that pair by two points.\nWenger pays for Sanchez blunder\nArsenal and Arsene Wenger had so much riding on this game - a meeting where they knew defeat would leave them outside the Premier League's top four.\nIt made his decision to leave his most dangerous attacker Sanchez on the bench totally inexplicable, Wenger's tactical ploy backfiring badly as Liverpool assumed control in those crucial first 45 minutes.\nBrave or desperate? Or a touch of both? Either way it was consigned to the dustbin at the interval.\nWenger preferred the physicality and aerial threat of Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck but Arsenal's failure to arrive in any attacking positions in the first half totally negated any impact he hoped they would have.\nThe folly of Wenger's selection was further exposed by the manner in which Sanchez transformed Arsenal's approach when he emerged as a substitute, setting up Welbeck's goal - although the Chilean's energy levels dried up as the half went on.\nWenger's decisions will come under the closest scrutiny as speculation continues about his future, and if Arsenal miss out on the Champions League failed moves like this will understandably be portrayed in an unflattering light.\nSanchez's demeanour at the final whistle told the tale. As Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp celebrated with his backroom team, he offered the briefest of gestures to Arsenal's fans before going straight down the tunnel.\nRead more: Wenger 'strong enough' to deal with decision to drop Sanchez\nKlopp masters rivals again\nLiverpool have faltered badly against the Premier League's strugglers, losing and performing dismally in defeat at Hull City and Leicester City - who were both in the bottom three when those games kicked off.\nKlopp, however, has mastered the art of overcoming Liverpool's closest rivals and this may yet be the key to achieving the top four place that was the goal before the start of the season.\nKlopp's record against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham is highly impressive and this victory leaves his team with seven wins, eight draws and one defeat from 16 league games.\nThis was not a vintage Liverpool performance, but the energy and creation shown here was in stark contrast to that shown at the King Power Stadium on Monday and more akin to the recent 2-0 win against Spurs here at Anfield.\nLiverpool were helped by Philippe Coutinho's best display since he returned from a seven-week absence with an ankle injury, while Ragnar Klavan offered a more physical defensive presence than Lucas, dropped after the Leicester debacle.\nThis result keeps Liverpool in the shake-up for a Champions League place - but also underscores why they have collapsed in the title race.\nResults against your closest rivals, while desirable, are not enough on their own.\nWijnaldum the man for the big occasion\nQuietly and without fuss, Wijnaldum is having a fine impact at Liverpool in his first season since his \u00a325m move from Newcastle United.\nHe operates in the shadow of more eye-catching players such as Coutinho, Adam Lallana and Firmino, but he is missed when he is not playing and contributes vital goals when he does.\nWijnaldum scored the winner against Manchester City, the equaliser against Chelsea and the vital third goal here. The man for the big occasion.\nMan of the match - Sadio Mane (Liverpool)\nLiverpool unbeaten in nine against top six\nLiverpool are unbeaten in their nine Premier League games this season against the current top six (W5 D4).\nArsenal haven't won any of their last 11 Premier League away games against the other teams currently in the top six (W0 D5 L6).\nThe Gunners find themselves outside the Premier League top four at the end of a day for the first time since 13 January.\nSadio Man\u00e9 has both scored and assisted in four Premier League games this season, more than any other player.\nAlexis Sanchez has been directly involved in a league-high 26 goals in his 26 Premier League games this season, scoring 17 and assisting nine.\nThe Liverpool v Arsenal fixture in the Premier League has produced 17 90+ minute goals, more than any other Premier League game.\n'Simon Mignolet saved our lives' - what they said\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"It was one of the best games we have played so far because of the strength of our opponent.\n\"We did really well. We had hard words after the defeat at Leicester. We analysed it and that wasn't enjoyable.\n\"We had another opportunity and we took it today. It's the rollercoaster of the Premier League.\n\"All of them played a fantastic game. When we are compact it's fantastic. Adam Lallana can come out of the formation and trigger something. Being compact and stable is the basis of each good display.\n\"We knew Arsenal would bounce back in the second half. Alexis Sanchez is the highest quality player and plays different to Danny Welbeck. Simon Mignolet saved our lives.\n\"It's important to go back to fourth above Arsenal. We really felt bad last week, we needed a few days to understand what happened.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Our performance was not at the level we expect in the first half but that is down to a lack of rhythm, we have not played for a while.\n\"The collective response was very strong in the second half.\"\nWhat's next?\nLiverpool have over a week to recover before they host Burnley on Sunday, 12 March in the Premier League.\nBut Arsenal have no such luck. They welcome Bayern Munich to the Emirates for the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie on Tuesday, 7 March with a 5-1 deficit to turn around.\nAnd on Saturday, 11 March they play Lincoln in the FA Cup sixth round."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 Everton\nHarry Kane scored twice and produced another masterclass in centre-forward play as second-placed Tottenham defeated Everton to close the gap on leaders Chelsea to seven points.\nThe 23-year-old is now the leading scorer in the Premier League with 19 goals, and has found the net 14 times in 12 league and cup games in 2017.\nHe gave Tottenham the lead in the 20th minute when he unleashed a venomous strike from 20 yards that beat Joel Robles at his near post.\nThe England forward's second came after the break. Belgian Mousa Dembele caught French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin dawdling on the ball, allowing Dele Alli to poke a pass through to his team-mate. The Spurs striker then applied a sidefoot finish past the Spanish keeper.\nKane's opposite number Romelu Lukaku had struggled for service up until the 81st minute when he scored with the Toffees' second effort on target.\nKevin Mirallas played a pass to the Belgian, who was given a clear sight on goal after Jan Vertonghen slipped. Lukaku kept his composure to slot in.\nA frantic finish saw both tiring defences exposed. First, Alli ghosted past his markers to poke in Harry Winks' free-kick and make it 3-1. And with seconds remaining, Everton substitute Enner Valencia beat the offside trap to tap in Ross Barkley's set-piece from the right.\nSpurs survived the remaining moments to secure their 16th league win of the season. The Toffees remain in seventh.\nChelsea will re-establish their 10-point lead on Monday if they defeat West Ham at London Stadium.\nAnalysis: Why Dele Alli gets the best out of Harry Kane\nRelive the action from White Hart Lane\nKane v Lukaku: England forward comes out on top\nBoth strikers went into the game with 17 league goals and four assists apiece this season. Yet on Sunday, one forward dominated.\nThe heatmap above shows Kane's positions, on the left, and Lukaku's on the right. Lukaku is clearly the focal point for Everton's attack; his Tottenham counterpart moves around more freely.\nHowever, the rigidity of Lukaku's positioning was easy to read for his markers. And when he did manage to lay a pass to his attacking foils Barkley and Tom Davies, they were repeatedly hounded off the ball by the diligent and dogged tracking of midfielders Dembele and Victor Wanyama.\nKane's positioning was less predictable. For his opener, he was deep on the left before moving forward and striking that sublime effort. And for his second, he was out on the left again but away from the action until Alli played him in.\nLukaku did manage to breach the Spurs backline in the final few moments, but he was aided by Vertonghen's unfortunate slip.\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said that Kane's good form is down to hard work.\n\"I think he is fresh because he trains a lot. He makes a lot of double sessions and he is very professional,\" said the Argentine.\n\"If you are asleep and you eat and you forget to train, maybe you are fat, like me! And you cannot run. I think it's about being consistent and training.\n\"He is very focused now in training and in taking care of himself and you can see how he is.\"\nDid Koeman play too safe?\nTottenham's defence had a very comfortable afternoon up until the final 10 minutes, but they might have faced a stiffer test had Everton manager Ronald Koeman opted for a more attacking set-up.\nThe Dutchman chose to start with 36-year-old defensive midfielder Gareth Barry rather than 19-year-old forward Ademola Lookman. It would have been seen as the perfect tactical switch had Barry blocked Kane's 20-yard strike that resulted in the opener, rather than make a half-hearted attempt.\nVeteran Barry, and Barkley, lost the battle in central midfield against the more energetic pairing of Dembele and Wanyama. Lookman's addition might have given that duo a tougher time.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\nKane deserves all the praise\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino on his side's chances of catching Chelsea: \"The most important thing is to show the belief on the pitch and today I think we showed that.\n\"More than talk and more than speak outside, it is better the team show their performance because I think (regarding) belief the answer is very easy.\n\"We need to be there, it's not up to us of course, but it's up to us to be ready if they fail.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"Lukaku showed again today, he's so strong and dangerous and if he gets a chance it's a goal. It wasn't a competition between the strikers today - but he and Kane both showed their quality of finishing.\n\"It was emotional until the last second. We started really well and made it tough for Tottenham to create space between the lines. But our mistakes were punished.\n\"Tottenham have had two or three years in a row with the same players. It's all about time which is what we need to have. If we get the time to improve, that's the next step for the club.\"\nLukaku becomes Everton's top Premier League scorer\nSpurs coach Mauricio Pochettino recorded his 100th win in English football as a manager (77 wins in 150 games for Tottenham and 23 wins in 60 games for Southampton).\nTottenham have won nine consecutive Premier League home games; their longest winning run in the competition.\nSpurs are unbeaten in their first 14 home top-flight league games of a season for the first time since 1964-65.\nRomelu Lukaku has scored more Premier League goals for Everton - 61 - than any other player.\nLukaku has scored 18 Premier League goals in 26 games this season, equalling his tally from last season (18 goals in 37 appearances in 2015-16).\nSince the start of last season no midfielder has scored more Premier League goals than Dele Alli (23).\nKevin Mirallas has provided more Premier League assists for Lukaku than any other player has for the striker (10).\nHarry Kane has scored 14 home league goals this season, the highest number ever recorded by a Spurs player in a single Premier League campaign.\nKane has netted 14 times in 12 competitive apps in 2017 for Spurs.\nWhat's next?\nSpurs are at home to Millwall in the last eight of the FA Cup next Sunday (14:00 GMT), before they are back in league action the following Sunday, at home to Southampton (14:15 GMT).\nEverton are back at Goodison Park next Saturday for the league game against West Brom (15:00 GMT)."

The Argentine's future was thrust into the spotlight after he lost his place to 19-year-old Gabriel Jesus last month, and he admitted this week his position at the club was unclear.\nGuardiola can be ruthless when he feels a player does not fit into his system, just ask Joe Hart, but a metatarsal injury for Brazil forward Jesus appears to have offered Aguero a lifeline.\nThe 28-year-old has now scored five goals in his last three games in all competitions for City, having gone six games without finding the net before that.\nGuardiola is building a team spearheaded by youth, and Aguero's poacher-like presence was complemented once again by the creativity of Sterling and Sane.\nSterling's trickery proved a constant threat down the right and Sane's sheer speed gave City an outlet on the opposite flank, gliding beyond his marker to finish left-footed past Pickford for the visitors' second.\nNo miracle cure for Moyes\nSunderland have become masters of beating the drop when appearing dead and buried in recent seasons, but they may have left the escape act too late this time around.\nSitting six points from safety at the bottom of the Premier League, the Black Cats' fate lies out of their hands.\nAnd with relegation rivals Crystal Palace, Swansea and Leicester enjoying a recent upturn in form, David Moyes needs something of a miracle if his side are to spring a late recovery.\nMoyes' side have taken points off Liverpool and Tottenham at home since the turn of the year, and did frustrate City for long spells in the first half, but once the visitors found a breakthrough they were able to keep Sunderland at arm's length.\nMan of the match - David Silva (Man City)\n'I don't like to defend a result at 2-0'\nSunderland manager David Moyes speaking to BBC Sport: \"I don't think you can fault the players for any of that. We lacked quality at times though. They did all they could to try to get something out of the game.\"\nOn the team: \"When you're in it every day you see the levels go up. We've got games coming up - we don't have to show it, we have to do it.\n\"We tried to make chances. The one that hits the post and comes out maybe that'll hit the inside of the post and go in next time.\n\"I hope our players understand the position that we're in, but we're not panicking.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Sport: \"We are so happy. We played good. We expected aggression and intensity. It was a very good first goal. It was important to go into half-time 1-0 up. If they were winning with the amazing atmosphere it would have been difficult.\n\"Leroy Sane is every day getting better. He has gaps to improve but he's only 21. He's an intelligent guy and a very nice guy. We are here to help him become what he can be.\n\"We were passing the ball between ourselves in the last 25 minutes. I don't like to defend a result and be near our box. It is OK if you're 3-0 or 4-0 up but not 2-0.\"\nRead more from Guardiola\nAguero hits 50 on the road - the stats\nManchester City have won 10 away league games this season - they've never won more in a single Premier League campaign (also 10 in 2011-12, 2013-14 and 2014-15).\nOnly Man Utd in 1993-94 and Chelsea in 2004-05 (both 11) have won more of their opening 14 away games in a single Premier League season.\nSergio Aguero became the 21st player to score 50 Premier League goals away from home.\nSunderland have failed to score in five of their last six Premier League games, the exception being a 4-0 win at Crystal Palace.\nDavid Silva has provided 62 assists in the Premier League since his debut, at least 11 more than any other player in that time (Wayne Rooney, 51).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City host Stoke on Wednesday, kick-off 20:00 GMT, before visiting Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on Saturday (12:15).\nSunderland are not back in action until Saturday, 18 March, when they welcome Burnley to the Stadium of Light."

The Belgium winger drove forward, played a one-two with Pedro and then shifted the ball past keeper Darren Randolph before slotting home.\nThe Blues doubled their lead after the break when Hazard's corner from the left was turned in with his thigh by Costa - the Spain striker's 17th league goal of the season.\nThe Hammers came close after Costa's strike when Sofiane Feghouli's low drive was brilliantly saved by Thibaut Courtois. Chelsea wing-back Marcos Alonso then appeared to block Manuel Lanzini's half-volley with his arm moments later - but referee Andre Marriner deemed it to be accidental.\nWest Ham finally pierced the last line of defence in stoppage time.

And one of the Blues' four defeats came at London Stadium in the EFL Cup earlier this season.\nBut perhaps what gave those fans greatest belief of a win was the return of Carroll, back after a month out with a groin injury - and the big striker was central to the Hammers' tactics.\nIn the opening 20 minutes, both Snodgrass and Feghouli provided the ex-Newcastle and Liverpool forward with high lofted balls. Unfortunately for Hammers manager Slaven Bilic, Chelsea had done their homework as their defenders repeatedly prevented Carroll from having an effort on goal.\nHe became a peripheral figure in the second half as West Ham looked for a new way of breaching the visitors' defence.\nThey managed to do so through Lanzini in the dying seconds, but there was too little time to find an equaliser.\nUnflappable Blues continue march to title\nNot even an intruder who made his way towards the Chelsea players after Hazard's goal could nudge the visitors off their stride. He, like West Ham's attack, was quickly contained.\nChelsea's attack then demonstrated why they are top of the table - the opening goal was a delight.\nKante, who as a defensive midfielder made the second-highest number of sprints on the night - 77 - darted back to cut out Snodgrass' ball. It was then over to Hazard and Pedro, with the Belgian having the confidence and composure to take the ball past Randolph before tucking in.\nIt was not as good as his Match of the Day goal of the month against Arsenal on 4 February, but impressive nonetheless. Costa, who had a quiet game, then added a simple second after the break.\nThe Blues did lose their concentration on two occasions: once when Courtois made a great save to block Feghouli's low drive, and then in stoppage time when the Belgium keeper was beaten by Lanzini.\nBut those mistakes have been few and far between this season.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nChelsea hit route 66 - the stats\nChelsea have enjoyed 118 Premier League London derby wins, more than any other side (one more than Arsenal).\nWest Ham have won only two of their past 22 Premier League clashes with Chelsea, losing 16 and drawing four.\nChelsea are the seventh side to accrue 66-plus points from their first 27 games of a Premier League season, having done it themselves twice before (69 in 2005-06 and 68 in 2004-05). All six previous sides have gone on to win the title.\nChelsea scored the opening goal of the game for the 21st time this season in the Premier League, four more times than any other side.\nChelsea are the only side to use all three substitutes in all of their Premier League games this season.\nLanzini has scored in eight of his 12 Premier League London derby appearances.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea have an FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester United coming up on Monday, 13 March (19:45 GMT) and then it is back to league action the following Saturday when they travel to Stoke.\nWest Ham are away at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, 11 March (15:00 GMT)."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 0-0 Stoke City\nManchester City's title hopes suffered a potentially-decisive blow after they were held by a resolute Stoke side and missed the chance to cut Chelsea's lead at the top of the table.\nA win for City would have moved them above Tottenham and into second place but they could not find the attacking spark required to break down a well-drilled Potters side.\nCity boss Pep Guardiola had said before kick-off that his team could not afford any more slip-ups in their pursuit of the leaders, who remain 10 points clear of the chasing pack with 11 games left.\nGuardiola's side were sluggish before the break and, although they improved when David Silva came off the bench in the second half, he could not make the difference.\nSilva had City's best effort when he drilled a low shot a fraction wide after a one-two with Fernandinho but, despite a flurry of late chances, Stoke keeper Lee Grant's only save came from a first-half free-kick by Aleksandar Kolarov.\nCity's big week starts badly\nCity are still, in theory at least, chasing silverware on three fronts and head to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on Saturday before travelling to Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nIt is a pivotal week in Pep Guardiola's first season in English football, but this result means it has started in frustrating fashion.\nThe attacking verve that had carried City to four straight league wins and seen them hit five goals past Monaco and Huddersfield in the last month was, initially, nowhere to be seen.\nToo many misplaced passes meant Stoke were under little pressure for much of the match, and City's finishing was also wide of the mark when they did create chances late on.\nSergio Aguero had scored five goals in his previous three games but did not find the target with any of his three efforts.\nLeroy Sane flashed a shot over the bar, Nicolas Otamendi headed over from a corner and City's last chance came and went when Kelechi Iheanacho met an inviting cross at the near post but steered the ball wide.\nGuardiola's rotation policy backfires\nRaheem Sterling was not involved while Guardiola opted to start with both Silva and defender John Stones on the bench.\n\"The rotations are good when you have a successful result but, when they are not, always we miss those people,\" said the City boss.\n\"It is almost impossible to play the same 11 players. When you have one game a week you can play the same 11 players no problem. We have a lot of games, we have to make a rotation - if not it will be so difficult.\"\nStoke display deserves plenty of credit\nThe Potters are still to beat a top-eight Premier League team this season but the performance that earned them this point deserves plenty of credit.\nMark Hughes said before kick-off that his side would be less open than normal but although they were indeed extremely disciplined at the back, they did more than defend in numbers.\nThe outcome could have been worse for the home side had Mame Biram Diouf not scuffed an early shot from close range following Gael Clichy's slip.\nBruno Martins Indi and Saido Berahino also had sniffs of goal when City left space at the back, but Stoke's main aim appeared to be a clean sheet and they accomplished that comfortably enough.\nThey were helped by City's lack of spark for much of the match, but this was still a significant defensive improvement on their last trip to play one of the top four, which ended in a 4-0 defeat at Tottenham last month.\nMan of the match - Ryan Shawcross (Stoke)\nThe commitment and industry of Stoke's entire side stood out but their defensive masterclass was superbly marshalled by Ryan Shawcross, who was a rock at centre-half and helped keep Sergio Aguero, among others, quiet.\n'The gap was big and is still big' - manager reaction\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"They defended deep and it was complicated to find the players between the lines. We were there in the last minutes. I don't have regrets about how they ran, how they fought.\n\"We created a lot of situations for the last pass and sometimes we missed it. When you analyse the chances we had, I don't really remember more than one Stoke chance.\"\nOn the title race: \"The gap was big and is still big. We have to focus game by game.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"Not many teams come here and restrict Manchester City to so few chances.\n\"We didn't rely on luck. We made our own luck and were difficult to break down. You can see what it meant tonight and that shows the honesty of the group.\"\nAnother clean sheet for Caballero - the stats\nWilly Caballero has now kept one more clean sheet for Man City this season (7) than Claudio Bravo (6) despite playing eight games fewer (17 v 25).\nThis was the first time Pep Guardiola has drawn a Premier League game 0-0 and his first in league competition since Dortmund 0-0 Bayern in March 2016.\nIn fact, this was the first time that Manchester City have failed to score at the Etihad Stadium under Pep Guardiola in all competitions (19 games).\nManchester City mustered just one shot on target in this game - their lowest tally in a competitive home game since April 2016 v Real Madrid (Champions League).\nStoke City have scored just one goal in their nine Premier League visits to the Etihad Stadium to face Man City.\nWhat's next?\nCity's FA Cup quarter-final with Middlesbrough is on Saturday at 12:15 GMT, then they head to Monaco for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Wednesday (19:45 GMT). They hold a 5-3 lead from the first meeting in Manchester.\nThis game was originally scheduled for the coming weekend, so Stoke do not play again until Saturday 18 March, when they host leaders Chelsea (15:00 GMT)."

Costa, who had a quiet game, then added a simple second after the break.\nThe Blues did lose their concentration on two occasions: once when Courtois made a great save to block Feghouli's low drive, and then in stoppage time when the Belgium keeper was beaten by Lanzini.\nBut those mistakes have been few and far between this season.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\nChelsea hit route 66 - the stats\nChelsea have enjoyed 118 Premier League London derby wins, more than any other side (one more than Arsenal).\nWest Ham have won only two of their past 22 Premier League clashes with Chelsea, losing 16 and drawing four.\nChelsea are the seventh side to accrue 66-plus points from their first 27 games of a Premier League season, having done it themselves twice before (69 in 2005-06 and 68 in 2004-05). All six previous sides have gone on to win the title.\nChelsea scored the opening goal of the game for the 21st time this season in the Premier League, four more times than any other side.\nChelsea are the only side to use all three substitutes in all of their Premier League games this season.\nLanzini has scored in eight of his 12 Premier League London derby appearances.\nWhat's next?\nChelsea have an FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester United coming up on Monday, 13 March (19:45 GMT) and then it is back to league action the following Saturday when they travel to Stoke.\nWest Ham are away at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, 11 March (15:00 GMT)."

In the second half, we controlled it. Our defensive organisation from set plays was outstanding.\n\"We will always score because we have those types of players.

We know maybe seventh position will bring it.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"Conceding the two goals before half-time killed us. Before that we were in the game.\n\"Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley were outstanding. We created some opportunities. Our biggest problem in the last couple of weeks has been the little bit of quality we need with a final pass or shot or cross. Everton had that.\n\"Everton are the best team outside the top six. They've got real quality.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer England winger Trevor Sinclair on Match of the Day\nRomelu Lukaku is improving year after year and he is still only 23. He is powerful, good in the air, and can finish with both feet.\nHe is ambitious, too. Everton have to match that ambition and succeed, because if they don't, he will leave.\nFormer England defender Martin Keown on Match of the Day\nMorgan Schneiderlin is the final bit of the jigsaw for Everton. With all the great players they have in front - Ross Barkley, Romelu Lukaku - somebody has to be the feeder and do the work in deep positions. But Schneiderlin also wants to pass and make things happen, he is an all-round player and will score goals, too.\nHe was told he wasn't good enough at Manchester United but he is good enough for Everton certainly. His lift over the keeper showed he can play.\n'Can't keep an away clean sheet' - the stats\nWest Brom have not kept a Premier League clean sheet on the road since the first game of the season at Crystal Palace, conceding in each of their last 13.\nEverton have won five consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since April 2014 (a run of seven).\nRomelu Lukaku has been involved in 24 Premier League goals this season (19 goals, 5 assists) - only Alexis Sanchez has been involved in more (26).\nIndeed, 19 goals is the Belgian's best return in a single Premier League campaign.\nRoss Barkley has provided an assist in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2015.\nThe Toffees have already equalled their Premier League points tally from each of the last two full seasons (47).\nWhat's next?\nBoth teams are at home next Saturday in the Premier League.

Niasse came out with a point to prove and boy has he proved it. They were two massive goals he got for his team today.\nWhat they said\nHull City manager Marco Silva: \"We got three important points, of course I am happy. It was a tough, tough game. We improved in the second half and after that we controlled the game.\n\"I'm not happy with the last five minutes to give gifts to the opponent. The game only finishes when the referee gives the sign.\n\"In the first half we had chances, and in the second half we improved our attitude and scored two goals. It is a fair result for us. We work two systems and the players know what we want.\n\"We need to take points away from home as well, it is difficult.\"\nSwansea City boss Paul Clement: \"The way we defended was not good enough. For long periods we looked like we were in control of the game and we were creating opportunities on the counter-attack.\n\"Two injuries in the first half have hurt us and in the second half we were limited to what we could do. Martin Olsson got hurt and we had to play with an injured player for the rest of the game. Overall we have to be disappointed with how they scored and how open we were.\n\"Fernando Llorente has been a key player to us recently and gives us lots of different threats, I don't think it is serious, I think he has a dead leg, Angel Rangel's is an injury to the ankle, I'm not sure how serious that one is. Martin got a knock on his ankle, he was not 100% but was able to continue.\n\"There's a lot of football to be played. I didn't think we were anywhere near safe and we are not anywhere near safe now. We have 10 games to go and have to bounce back next week against Bournemouth.\"\nSuper sub Niasse - the stats\nAll three of Oumar Niasse's Premier League goals for Hull City have been as a substitute.\nThe Swans have lost their past three visits to the KCOM Stadium, each in a different competition.\nSwansea have now conceded 61 goals this season. No side to have conceded 60 or more goals after 28 games of a Premier League season has stayed up.\nSwansea have now conceded more goals in the final 30 minutes of games than any other Premier League side this season (29).\nGylfi Sigurdsson has provided more assists than any other Premier League player this season (11)."

They needed Philippe Coutinho to be at his creative best to unlock a disciplined Burnley but the midfielder rarely made a telling pass while in attack Divock Origi failed to manage a single shot on goal.\nThe win may not have been pretty but that is something Liverpool have struggled to do this season and Klopp believes a corner may have been turned.\n\"It's the first ugly game we've won,\" he said.\n\"In the end I liked it - this is the kind of game we haven't won and we did.\"\nWill Burnley ever win away?\nFor 44 minutes, it was the perfect away performance for Burnley.\nThey got an early goal and then successfully nullified Liverpool to the point that a frustrated home crowd started to turn against their side.\nBut a one-goal lead meant they were always susceptible to getting caught out and the Clarets need to learn to kill off a game - only once have they scored more than one goal in an away game this season.\nBurnley's home form is likely to ensure they are in the Premier League next season - they are seven points above the relegation zone with 10 games remaining.\nHowever, a return of just two points from a possible 42 on the road this season will be of major concern for manager Sean Dyche.\nWhat they said\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"Burnley were always in the game, it was intense and we had to fight. We had some moments, it was not only luck that we scored before half-time and it was a wonderful goal from Emre Can.\n\"It is clear we have to do a few things better. We were not at our absolute best but we fought. I liked it, it is this kind of game we haven't won until now. It feels kind of strange a little bit. Not the most memorable game but a very nice three points.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It's a tough one to take, because everyone gave a really good account of ourselves and went up with a sublime goal, but it's a tough place to come.\n\"Their first was a soft one to concede before half-time, and the second one we're disappointed with but we gave a really good account of ourselves. We just needed a scratch of luck along the way.\"\nMan of the match - Ashley Barnes\nLiverpool love long-range shots - the stats\nLiverpool have now won 16 Premier League games this season; equalling their tally of wins for the entire 2015-16 season.\nLiverpool have won 14 points from losing positions in the league this term; a joint-high with Tottenham.\nAshley Barnes (10) is now just one goal short of tying with Danny Ings (11) for the most Premier League goals for Burnley.\nLiverpool conceded inside the first 10 minutes of a league game at Anfield for the first time since August 2015 (v West Ham, Manuel Lanzini).\nAll 16 of Georginio Wijnaldum's Premier League goals have been scored in home matches (five for Liverpool, 11 for Newcastle).\nSince Jurgen Klopp's first game in charge, the Reds have scored more Premier League goals from outside the box than any other team (21).\nWhat next?\nIt's a big game for Liverpool in the battle for a top-four finish as they travel to Manchester City on Sunday, 19 March (16:30 GMT).

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 3-1 Arsenal\nArsenal suffered a fourth defeat in five league games as Craig Dawson's double helped West Brom inflict a major blow to the Gunners' hopes of a top-four finish.\nDawson capitalised on some awful defending from the Gunners to head both of his goals from corners - the first to give the Baggies the lead, the second to seal their win.\nArsenal had initially rallied after falling behind, levelling through Alexis Sanchez's close-range finish - the Chilean forward's 18th league goal of the season.\nHowever, they fell behind again 10 minutes into the second half when substitute Hal Robson-Kanu rolled the ball home with only his second touch after coming on.\nArsenal, who lost goalkeeper Petr Cech to injury, were outfought and unable to rally a second time, their challenge wilting soon after Danny Welbeck's header from a corner struck the crossbar.\nIt was an eventful encounter, both on the pitch and above it as two planes pulling banners - one pro-Arsene Wenger and the other against the Arsenal boss - made circles around The Hawthorns.\nIt was the anti-Wenger camp who were most present and vocal by the end, though, holding aloft banners declaring 'Enough is enough' and booing their beleaguered manager's decision to substitute Sanchez, who had picked up a knock.\nAfter the game, Wenger said that he would announce \"very soon\" whether he will remain at the club after reaching a decision on his future.\nThe current facts are these - Arsenal trail fourth place by five points (albeit with a game in hand).\nThey must arrest a run that has seen them win just one of their last five league games if they are to continue their proud record of finishing in the top four in each of Wenger's 20 seasons at the club so far.\nWenger to reveal future plans 'very soon'\nRelive Arsenal's draw with West Brom\nThe end is nigh?\nAfter claiming a top-two finish in every season between 1997-98 and 2004-05, Arsenal have often flirted with fifth or worse since, but this is looking increasingly likely to be the campaign when they drop below the division's premier quartet.\nThere is also a growing feeling this is likely to be Wenger's last as manager.\nA two-year contract extension remains on the table but with fan protests growing in size and volume, rumours of players wanting away from the club and form deteriorating, there may be no appetite for it to be signed, by either manager or club.\nThis result felt like a new low during Wenger's tenure.\nThe Gunners boss is used to seeing his side outfought and beaten at the home of teams managed by Tony Pulis - he has only managed one win in eight such encounters - but the lack of chances they created from almost 77% possession and the speed with which they fell apart after Robson-Kanu's goal, lays bare a side with dwindling belief and backbone.\nThey rallied efficiently after falling behind, but this also speaks to their over-reliance on Sanchez, whose movement made the goal and who remained their only real creative spark, despite the heavy-handed treatment dealt out to him by the home side.\nTheir vulnerability at the back is alarming. They knew about West Brom's threat from corners - the Baggies have now scored 14 from them this season - but yet they were unable to prevent Dawson twice getting his head to the ball first in the box to score.\nRobson-Kanu's goal was equally damning as Ospina proved an inadequate replacement for Cech, sliding out to meet a chipped ball over the top and gifting the striker his finish.\nWest Brom corner poor Arsenal\nWest Brom have never managed more than 49 Premier League points. Prior to Saturday they had not managed to beat a top-seven team this season.\nHaving rectified the latter, they now look on course to better the former.\nThey came into this game having lost their last two games and from the off it was clear they were not prepared to entertain the prospect of suffering three successive defeats for the first time this campaign.\nBut for Cech, they could have been ahead before Dawson broke the deadlock, with the Gunners keeper tipping away Darren Fletcher's goalbound drive.\nWhen they were pegged back by Sanchez, their belief held, as did their faith in Pulis' game plan, which also stretched to superbly-timed substitutions.\nIt helps, of course, when you are so lethal from set-pieces and your opponent so incapable of defending them.\nMan of the match - Craig Dawson (West Brom)\n'We face some serious challenges' - What the managers said\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis, after ending a run of two defeats: \"I think everybody's got to calm down. You're always going to have runs of games where you don't pick points up. You raise the expectation and people get carried away.\n\"The lads have worked so hard in all the games. I thought we'd never play as well as what we have played. They've never given anything but their best.\n\"The lads were a bit disappointed with two defeats. They've done fantastically well. They've carried on working so hard together as a group. I thought on the counter we always looked dangerous.\n\"We've got 43 points. We know where we are as a football club. We're not getting carried away.\n\"We'll do the best we possibly can. If we win games, brilliant. If we don't we've still got a group of honest players who give everything.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a typical Premier League game. A team that likes to play and a team that defends well.\n\"It was a tough performance. They caught us on set-pieces and one break and that made the difference.\n\"Overall our record against set-pieces is quite good. We were a bit naive, maybe, on the corners. Then we were punished. It's a shame. We looked in the second half to take completely over.\n\"We didn't create enough. We lost Sanchez in the second half, he was very dangerous in the first. He came out in the second half and he couldn't move any more. In the first half he was a guy who created a lot.\n\"It leaves us in a unique situation that we've never had before. We face big problems to regroup and find resources to sort out the problem. We need some togetherness.\n\"We face some serious challenges. The City game at home is a big game for us.\"\nSanchez hits 100 - the stats you need to know\nArsenal have lost four out of five Premier League games for the first time in since April 1995.\nAlexis Sanchez has been involved in 27 PL goals this season (18 goals, nine assists) - more than any other player in the competition.\nOverall, Sanchez has now been involved in 100 goals for the Gunners in all competitions, scoring 64 and assisting 36.\nThere were just two minutes and 45 seconds between the first two goals in this game.\nWhat next?\nThe international break means the Gunners host Manchester City on Sunday, 2 April.\nWest Brom take on the other Manchester side that weekend, with United hosting the Baggies on Saturday, 1 April."

We caused problems for our opponents and had some good chances.\n\"We started well in first 25 minutes of the second half.

        "article_text": "West Ham United 2-3 Leicester City\nLeicester City held on to claim their first Premier League away win of the season and further ease their relegation worries in a stirring victory over West Ham.\nThe Foxes scored twice inside the first seven minutes as Riyad Mahrez's cross evaded Hammers keeper Darren Randolph before an unmarked Robert Huth headed in Marc Albrighton's deft chipped pass following an excellent set-piece move.\nManuel Lanzini put the hosts back in contention with a sublime free-kick on 20 minutes, only for Jamie Vardy to restore his side's two-goal advantage before the break as he pounced on lax defending from Albrighton's corner to strike high past Randolph.\nAfter the interval, Andre Ayew headed in after Andy Carroll won the ball at the back post from a corner as West Ham exerted constant pressure on the visitors in a dramatic finale.\nHowever, Kasper Schmeichel made two tremendous saves to deny Carroll from close range late on and secure a fourth straight victory for the Foxes under new manager Craig Shakespeare as they move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\nAyew also fired over when free on goal, ensuring Slaven Bilic's side are now winless in five league games as their struggles in the first year at the London Stadium continue.\nHammers' Antonio set to miss England duty\nRelive the action as Leicester hold on to beat West Ham\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nFast starts and frantic finishes\nLeicester's resurgence under Shakespeare following the sacking of Claudio Ranieri is no longer surprising, even if the reasons behind it remain slightly disputed, but their first half showing here was perhaps the closest they have come to last year's thrilling title-winning performances.\nTheir first goal was fortuitous as Mahrez's cross from deep missed both Shinji Okazaki's run across the six-yard box and Randolph's last-ditch attempted save but it rocked West Ham and the visitors capitalised ruthlessly.\nMahrez, unrecognisable from the forlorn figure of earlier this season, combined brilliantly with opposite winger Albrighton in a well-worked free-kick that saw the latter chip a reverse pass first-time over the Hammers defence for Huth to easily nod past Randolph.\nAfter that early one-two punch, Leicester played football worthy of their status as champions, drawing the Hammers out of shape with their passing, while England striker Vardy scored only his second away league goal of the campaign.\nHowever, the second half was more reminiscent of Leicester's problems at the start of this year as their decision to slow the pace of the game only seemed to stifle their own creativity and invite West Ham back into the contest.\nUltimately, though, Shakespeare's side showed enough grit in the absence of injured captain Wes Morgan at the back to double their points won on the road this season.\nThe Great Dane puts in a man-of-the-match performance\nAll of Leicester's attacking endeavour and rearguard defence would have been futile if not for Schmeichel.\nThe Danish international made a staggering save in added time as substitute Robert Snodgrass' free-kick was deflected into the path of Carroll six yards out, only for his thumping volley to be kept out by Schmeichel's out-stretched right arm.\nIn terms of difficulty, it was harder than either of his penalty saves in Leicester's last-16 Champions League ties against Sevilla and a reminder that Schmeichel deserves to be included in any debate over the best keeper in the Premier League.\nThe only blot on his performance came when he could have perhaps got a stronger palm to Ayew's header for West Ham's second, while he stood no chance from Lanzini's free-kick.\nHe also clawed out Carroll's header on 77 minutes while falling behind the line and kept his composure as West Ham peppered the Leicester area with crosses and corners in the second half.\nHammers sick of home\nBilic's side now have a paltry five wins from 15 home league games in their new stadium, while their goals scored and conceded records are better on their travels.\nNot that they were lacking in support here as the atmosphere inside the London Stadium lifted throughout the second half, having initially been wiped out by West Ham's dismal start.\nIt was their defence's appalling lack of concentration in the first 15 minutes that essentially decided the outcome of the game, given that the hosts were the better side after the break as Michail Antonio, Ayew and Carroll menaced the Leicester back four.\nIn that trio, together with the excellent free-kick abilities of Lanzini, the Hammers have the attacking talent to test most teams and soften the blow of losing Dimitri Payet to Marseille.\nYet January signing Jose Fonte has added no stability to a defence that has now conceded 27 league goals at home this season - only Swansea have leaked more with 30 - while fellow centre-back Winston Reid limped off with a leg injury after just 18 minutes.\nWest Ham are now only three points above Leicester in 11th and have nine games to salvage a decidedly disappointing season.\nManager reaction\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"It is very frustrating for us to lose the game. We didn't start well and what is really disappointing is the way we conceded three goals.\n\"In this league you can't afford to be 3-1 down and try to turn the game around. But they showed character. Last 20 minutes the ball just didn't want to go in.\n\"You can call it poor finishing but we have to give huge credit to Kasper Schmeichel, especially for the save to the last chance from Andy Carroll.\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare: \"We showed all the attributes to win a game. We started really well and got the goals but it was backs to the wall at the end.\n\"We have to give West Ham credit. They threw everything at us in the second half and Kasper had to make some special saves again. My heart was in my mouth at times.\n\"On the outside you try to keep calm and collected to keep the players focused. I am intensely proud of the results we have got.\"\nShakespeare makes history - match stats\nCraig Shakespeare is the first manager in Premier League history to have his side score three-plus goals in his first three games in the competition.\nWest Ham are without a win in four league home games (D1 L3) for the first time since January 2014.\nLeicester secured their first league away win of the season in their 14th game.\nRiyad Mahrez has scored as many league goals in three games under Craig Shakespeare, as he had in his final 22 under Claudio Ranieri.\nMarc Albrighton has had a hand in three goals in his past four appearances for Leicester in all competitions, as many as in his previous 27.\nManuel Lanzini has now registered his best-ever goal haul in a Premier League season (seven).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham face back-to-back away games as they travel to Hull on Saturday, 1 April (15:00 BST) and Arsenal on Wednesday, 5 April (19:45 BST).\nLeicester are at home twice in a row as they face Stoke on Saturday, 1 April (15:00 BST) and Sunderland on Tuesday, 4 April (19:45 BST)."

We changed the backroom staff and are now starting to implement our ideas and seeing the benefit.\n\"We are looking very solid. No doubt the biggest problem was the amount of goals we were conceding and now we are not conceding those goals.\n\"It is now four wins in six. We are getting there. This was a tough game - Watford recently won at Arsenal. We toughed it out and our quality paid off and we deserved the win.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"We are not happy - there was a foul before the goal and it was an own goal. We didn't deserve to lose.\n\"We should have played better on the wings. If we did, we probably would have scored a goal. We didn't concede anything, to lose like this is disappointing.\"\nWatford's away day blues continue - the best stats\nCrystal Palace are only the fourth team since 2003-04 to win a Premier League game without directing a single shot on target.\nWatford have enjoyed just one victory in their past 10 Premier League away games (D2 L7).\nThe Hornets have failed to find the back of the net in five of their past seven top-flight games on the road.\nPalace have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014.\nOnly Sunderland (22) have failed to score a first-half goal in more Premier League games this season than Crystal Palace (21, level with Hull).\nTroy Deeney is the first Watford player in Premier League history to score two own goals in the competition (v Crystal Palace, and last season v Manchester United).\nWhat's next?\nAfter the international break, Crystal Palace travel to Premier League leaders Chelsea on 1 April, looking for an unlikely fourth consecutive victory, while Watford host bottom-of-the-table Sunderland the same day (both 15:00 BST kick-offs)."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 1-2 Chelsea\nGary Cahill made up for conceding a penalty by scoring a late winner as Chelsea moved a step closer to the Premier League title with victory at Stoke.\nThe England defender settled a heated encounter three minutes from time by sweeping home after Stoke failed to clear a Cesc Fabregas corner.\nIt sent Chelsea 13 points clear at the top with 10 games to play.\nChelsea striker Diego Costa was involved in a running battle with Stoke's defenders - being booked himself and involved in incidents that saw Bruno Martins Indi and Phil Bardsley cautioned.\nAnd the home side were reduced to 10 men in added time when Bardsley was sent off for a second bookable offence.\nWillian had given Chelsea a first-half lead with an inswinging free-kick from the left that caught out keeper Lee Grant at his near post.\nMartins Indi had a goal ruled out for a push by Saido Berahino on Cesar Azpilicueta, but the hosts drew level when Cahill was ruled to have pushed Jon Walters, who blasted in the penalty.\nThe visitors had nearly all the chances, with Marcos Alonso firing a free-kick against the bar and Pedro denied by a fine Grant save.\nRelive Stoke 1-2 Chelsea as it happened\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League matches\nNo Hazard - no problem\nEven the absence of Eden Hazard with a muscle problem did not ultimately thwart Chelsea, whose relentless consistency has been extraordinary.\nHazard's absence, only confirmed an hour before kick-off, was the major surprise as Antonio Conte's side sought a fifth successive win.\nPedro proved a willing deputy, but it was two players who scored against Stoke in the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge who provided the goals.\nWillian, who struck twice in a 4-2 win over Hughes' side on New Year's Eve, caught out Grant with a marvellous piece of quick thinking to whip his first-half free-kick inside the near post.\nCahill's winner actually came after a decent five-minute spell of Stoke pressure as the game opened up in the closing stages.\nThe decisive goal was a tribute to the work ethic Conte has instilled in his players - coming from a corner won after substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek harassed Erik Pieters into over-hitting a back pass.\nChelsea have now won 20 of their past 23 matches in all competitions, and look unstoppable.\nCosta causes chaos\nStoke boss Mark Hughes has spoken in the past of his admiration for Costa - a striker of undoubted talent who plays on the edge.\nHughes, a fearsome centre-forward in his playing days, has suggested he sees a bit of his own playing style in Costa's game.\nThe Spain international certainly did his best to rough up Stoke's defenders, and seemed in danger of getting sent off after he was booked with barely a quarter-of-an-hour gone.\nHis tussles with Martins Indi were a feature of the game from the off, and referee Anthony Taylor had to speak to both players following an early off-the-ball tangle.\nCosta, though, drew the Stoke defenders into the battle - and then concentrated more on his football after half-time to keep himself out of trouble.\nHe made sure not to retaliate when Bardsley clattered him shortly before the break, then forced Martins Indi into a challenge for which he was booked.\nThere was to be no goal for Costa - chasing his 50th in the Premier League - but he still came out smiling as Stoke lost their discipline.\nStoke fall short against big boys\nHughes has managed a consistency of his own since arriving at Stoke in 2013 - three successive ninth-place finishes, and a fourth more than likely.\nHis players showed they were more than ready to match Chelsea physically, as Martins Indi and Ryan Shawcross relished their battle with Costa, but the home side were second best here.\nWalters' penalty was their only shot on target, and although they did well to stay in the game for so long, there was no question the visitors deserved their win.\nStoke, nonetheless, showed the grit that earned them a draw at Manchester City in their last match, and Geoff Cameron did a fine job in helping out his defenders when Chelsea's sharp passing threatened to overwhelm them.\nIn the end, it was not enough - and Stoke remain without a win this season against any side currently in the top half of the table.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nChelsea's free-kick wonder\nEight of Willian's past 19 goals for Chelsea have been from direct free-kicks.\nThe Brazilian's goal was his sixth in the Premier League this season - his best tally in a single campaign in the competition.\nStoke have won only one of their 13 Premier League games against teams placed top of the table on the day of the game (W1 D2 L10).\nCahill is the first Chelsea player to score a goal and concede a penalty in the same Premier League game since Salomon Kalou did so against West Ham in April 2009.\nWalters has been directly involved in 60 Premier League goals for Stoke (42 goals, 18 assists); more than any other Potters player.\nAzpilicueta made his 150th Premier League appearance for Chelsea, becoming the first Spaniard to reach the milestone for the Blues.\nStoke have won only two of their 18 Premier League meetings with Chelsea (D3 L13).\nWhat's next?\nThe Premier League takes a break for the next round of World Cup qualifiers, after which Chelsea host Crystal Palace on 1 April, the same day Stoke visit Leicester."

        "article_text": "Sunderland 0-0 Burnley\nBottom club Sunderland drifted further from safety with a draw at home to Burnley, whose wait for a first away win of the Premier League season continues.\nBurnley should have made their early superiority tell through Ashley Barnes, who prodded wide from six yards out just before the break, following Scott Arfield's defence-splitting flick.\nAfter half-time, Sunderland improved hugely, and Tom Heaton made a fine stop at his far post to deny Adnan Januzaj's volley, before Billy Jones somehow headed a glorious chance wide from four yards out.\nJordan Pickford denied Sam Vokes with three minutes to play, while Heaton pulled off another save to turn Fabio Borini's shot wide as both sides continued to spurn good chances right up to the final whistle.\nDavid Moyes' side are now without a win from their past six home matches, and Crystal Palace's 1-0 victory over Watford plunged them further into relegation trouble.\nWith 10 matches of the season remaining, the Black Cats are now seven points away from Swansea in 17th, with the Welsh club beaten 2-0 by Bournemouth in Saturday's 17:30 GMT kick-off.\nThe draw at the Stadium of Light was 13th-placed Burnley's third on the road this season, with Sean Dyche's side having taken three points from a possible 45 away from Turf Moor.\nRelive Sunderland v Burnley\nReaction to Saturday's games\nHow did Jones miss?\nFollowing his return to the England squad on Thursday, all eyes were on Jermain Defoe as the man most likely to spearhead what would have been a vital Sunderland win.\nThe striker has scored 14 of his side's 24 goals in the league this season, but he was a peripheral figure in a disjointed and nervy performance that only briefly improved in short periods after the break.\nJanuzaj should have scored but hit Defoe's clipped pass across goal straight at Burnley keeper Heaton, Seb Larsson skied over from close range as the ball was played back, but the best chance fell to full-back Jones.\nRunning to the far post at speed, he appeared to lose his balance when failing to steer in what looked like a simple chance on his head from Larsson's excellent cross.\nThe miss may prove to be costly indeed.\nWhere there was faint hope of survival following Sunderland's 4-0 thumping of Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in early February, there must now be a growing realisation that relegation to England's second tier - from where they were promoted as 2006-07 champions - is the far more likely outcome.\nBurnley's wait goes on\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche said his side were unfortunate to come away with nothing from an excellent display at Liverpool last Sunday, and he may well feel the same about drawing on Wearside.\nBarnes' missed chance came at the end of a first half the Clarets totally dominated, and it was only during a 15-minute spell after the break that Sunderland fought back and conjured openings of their own.\nLate substitute Vokes had two good chances in the game's closing stages, his second following a bad Jason Denayer error in defence that he should have profited from with a goal.\nSunderland centre-back Denayer dallied on the ball and allowed Vokes to steal in, but the striker's powerful low shot was denied by Pickford's strong right hand, with just three minutes to play.\nThe point moves Burnley level with Derby County's team of 2007-08 as the side with the joint worst away record in Premier League history.\nBut they still have four away matches - against Middlesbrough, Everton, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth - to move themselves clear of that very unwelcome record.\nMan of the match - Scott Arfield (Burnley)\nSunderland fail to score again - the stats\nSunderland failed to score in a Premier League game for the 13th time this season - no side has failed to find the net more often.\nThe Clarets kept only their second away clean sheet this season - their first since a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in October.\nSean Dyche's side had 17 shots, the joint most they've ever managed in a single Premier League away game.\nKeeper Jordan Pickford played more passes (48) and had more touches (59) than any other Sunderland player.\n'We missed some big chances today'\nSunderland manager David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Our first half wasn't as good as the second. We missed some big chances today, which maybe we've not been getting in other games, but you've got to take them.\n\"Burnley make it difficult for a lot of teams, and they had one or two chances themselves, but we had to take one of ours. I thought we had the best of them.\n\"Billy had a header, Adnan had a chance at the back post, there were three or four. The players gave their all but we lacked a bit of quality at times - in all areas.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Only three points away, but we've been working hard. We had two golden chances in the first half and were in control of the game, then they came out and improved.\n\"They had to try and win and threw caution to the wind, we got a bit nervy and were not quite as good as we were at Anfield last week. But that's the madness of it. We lost against Liverpool and got a point today.\n\"Sometimes you need that rub of the green and I thought when Vokesy went through that one would seal it for us, but Pickford, an excellent young keeper, made a very fine save. It was a game of missed chances for both sides.\"\nWhat's next?\nSunderland next play away to Watford in the Premier League on 1 April, after the international break. Burnley host Tottenham in the league on the same day."

It has been a long time since we have been solid enough to do that.\n\"Swansea have talented players so to keep them so quiet is very satisfying. We have kept a very good striker quiet.\n\"The players have stuck with it. They have not got low or negative and were able to ride out a period when we weren't getting things as we wanted to. That has been key.\"\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: \"We were clearly not good enough. For periods we did OK then we suffered a blow and our performance went right down. In the second half it was a similar situation.\n\"I think Bournemouth were good for the victory. We have to be more clinical and we have to rebuild and go again. They got luck with the first goal and the second is a mistake by us. They deserved to win.\"\nSwansea's unwanted own-goal record - the best stats\nBournemouth are unbeaten in three Premier League games (W2 D1) for the first time since October (4 games).\nSwansea have kept just one clean sheet in their past 14 games and have shipped a league-high 63 goals this season.\nThe Cherries have scored two or more goals in seven of their past eight games against Swansea.\nSwansea have netted 10 own goals in the league over the course of the past two seasons, more than any other side in the Football League in that period.\nMawson is one of just three players - along with team-mate Jack Cork and Bournemouth's Tyrone Mings - to score two top-flight own goals this season.\nWayne Routledge made his 181st Premier League appearance for Swansea, equalling Ashley Williams' record for the most games for the club in the competition.\nAfobe has scored two Premier League goals against Swansea, more than against any other side.\nKing has been directly involved in eight goals in his past six Premier League games (7 goals, 1 assist).\nWhat's next?\nSwansea face a crucial home match against relegation rivals Middlesbrough on 2 April, the day after Bournemouth make their shortest away trip of the season when they visit Southampton."

        "article_text": "Middlesbrough 1-3 Manchester United\nManchester United moved up to fifth in the Premier League as Middlesbrough's first game since the departure of manager Aitor Karanka ended in defeat.\nAshley Young's deep cross found Marouane Fellaini at the back post to head past Victor Valdes, before Jesse Lingard's terrific strike doubled United's lead after the break.\nBoro, with head coach Steve Agnew in charge, were invited to apply pressure and when Chris Smalling made a mess of an easy clearance in the box, substitute Rudy Gestede pounced.\nBut former United keeper Valdes slipped in stoppage time and Antonio Valencia's tap-in secured the three points.\nJose Mourinho's side leapfrog Arsenal and Everton into fifth, while Middlesbrough remain 19th in the table and are five points from safety.\nHaving parted ways with Karanka on Thursday, Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson charged Agnew with helping the Riverside club avoid the drop.\nBut the former assistant manager was unable to inspire his side to a fifth Premier League win this season despite dominating possession for large periods of the game.\nAlvaro Negredo looked isolated up front before Agnew introduced Gestede on 67 minutes, and with two in attack Boro looked capable of drawing level.\nBut United, showing seven changes from their Europa League win over FC Rostov in midweek, ground out a tricky three points.\nSix hundred Premier League wins\nThis was Manchester United's 600th victory in the Premier League - making them the first side to reach the landmark.\nAnd while this was a notable moment for the club, their manager will surely be more concerned with their rise up the Premier League table and their ability to grind out a win without suspended top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and injured record signing Paul Pogba.\nUnited finish the day inside the top five of the Premier League table for the first time in 184 days.\nAnd they are also on an 18-game unbeaten run in the competition stretching back to a 4-0 loss to Chelsea in October, but have only moved up two places, from seventh to fifth, during that spell.\nThey have finally moved away from sixth spot - a position they have made their own this season - and are now in a position to challenge for the top four.\nReaction: Agnew wants permanent Middlesbrough job\nRelive Sunday's Premier League matches\nNew boss, same old Boro\nMiddlesbrough dominated possession in the first 15 minutes as they started the game on the attack.\nBut the lowest scoring team in the Premier League, with just 20 goals, once again failed to turn pressure into points.\nFresh from taking over from Karanka, Agnew made four changes, three of them in attack, from his side's FA Cup defeat by Manchester City.\nGaston Ramirez, Stewart Downing and Alvaro Negredo replaced Adama Traore, Gestede and Cristhian Stuani - but Ramirez was the only player to force a save from United goalkeeper David de Gea in the first half.\nAnd once Fellaini found the back of the net on 29 minutes, the stats looked even more grim for Boro.\nBoro have gone behind 16 times this season, and only picked up two points from a losing position.\nAnd the last time United lost a Premier League game having taken the lead was away at Swansea in August 2015.\nAgnew's side did produce a response once 2-0 down, with Gestede netting Boro's first goal in eight and a half hours of football, but a lack of clinical finishing once again proved to be their downfall.\nGestede's impact on the game also included a clash with United defender Eric Bailly which prompted a mass confrontation between the two sides, while the ill-feeling appeared to continue as the players headed for the tunnel after full-time.\nMan of the match - Jesse Lingard\nWhat they said\nMiddlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: \"If we show that commitment and that sort of intensity until the end of the season then we have a real chance of staying in this league.\n\"It is a relief to get a goal and I felt that when we got that goal, we had Manchester United defending in the box for their lives and again we didn't quite get the bounce of the ball to get the equaliser, which on the balance of play I thought we deserved.\n\"I know that we will take that fighting spirit for the rest of the season.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"[I applaud] our attitude and desire and our way of thinking. We don't have plan B, C, D, E, F and G - but we have M, N, O, P and S.\n\"It is fantastic because we manage in the same week, to go to the quarter-finals of the Europa League which is an important target for us.\n\"At the same time, we got these three points that keep us in the race for the fourth position so we still have two doors for Champions League football next season.\n\"These guys gave everything, we started the game really well. Valdes made three fantastic saves before our first goal. We controlled everything until our second goal.\"\nWhat's next?\nThe Premier League takes a break for the next round of World Cup qualifiers, after which both Middlesbrough and Manchester United face hectic April schedules.\nMiddlesbrough\nMiddlesbrough have six games in the packed month, but the next two games could define their season.\nOn Sunday, 2 April (13:30 BST) they travel to relegation rivals Swansea before another away trip to Hull City three days later (19:45 BST).\nSwansea sit five points above them, just outside the relegation zone in 17th, with Hull in 18th, two points adrift of Middlesbrough.\nManchester United\nUnited host West Brom in the Premier League - the first of eight fixtures in April as they chase Europa League success and a top-four finish.\nMourinho criticised the Premier League during the week, bemoaning their fixture schedule and reluctance to aid clubs competing in Europe.\nBut United are no strangers to a busy back end of the season.\nBoth the 2008-09 and 2010-11 campaigns, under Sir Alex Ferguson, also featured eight April fixtures.\nThey lifted the Premier League title in both seasons, despite two semi-final exits in the FA Cup and losses to Barcelona in Champions League finals.\nAnd back in 1999, 14 games in 54 days were the climax to the most successful season in their history as United secured the FA Cup, Champions League and Premier League Treble.\nFellaini finally nets - stats\nThis was Middlesbrough's 1,000th top-flight league defeat; the 14th team to reach this tally.\nLingard scored his fifth Premier League goal for United - still one fewer than he has collectively in other competitions (one in the Community Shield, two in Europa League, one in EFL Cup, two in FA Cup).\nUnited have scored more goals from outside the box in the Premier League this season (six) than they did in 2015-16 (five).\nFellaini's strike ended his run of 30 Premier League appearances without a goal.\nThirteen of Fellaini's 33 Premier League goals have been headers (39%).\nGestede's goal was the first Middlesbrough have scored in the Premier League in 509 minutes of action.\nThis was the first time Mourinho has started a league game with a three-man defence since 15 May 2011 (Villarreal 1-3 Real Madrid in La Liga)."

It was difficult. In the end we were better and deserved to win.\n\"First half we played very well. Second half we conceded a goal with our mistake and we allowed Southampton to score. It is another victory, we keep our position second and we have reason to be happy.\n\"The aim is the next game. We have 10 days without our players we hope nothing happens and all will arrive in good position.\"\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"It was strange. In the first half without pressure we took two goals and it is difficult to accept this.\n\"In the second half we came back with good attitude and scored quick. At 2-1 there was a possibility to come back. In the end a draw would have been normal. It is disappointment. It was difficult for us but also for Tottenham.\"\nSpurs eye unbeaten home season - the stats you need to know\nSpurs have now won 10 successive league games at White Hart Lane - their longest run since October 1987 (14 in a row).\nThe only previous top-flight season that Spurs have remained unbeaten at home was 1964-65 (21 games, 0 defeats).\nAlli has scored in three successive league appearances at White Hart Lane for the first time in his career.\nAlli is the third Spurs player to score a penalty in the Premier League this season (after Kane & Janssen). Only in one previous Premier League season have Spurs seen 3+ players score a penalty for them - 1993-94; Sheringham (4), Barmby (1), Hazard (1) & Gray (1)\nJames Ward-Prowse has scored three goals in 21 Premier League appearances this season; the same tally as he had scored in 107 Premier League appearances before 2016-17.\nWhat next?\nAfter the international break Tottenham have successive away games at Burnley on 1 April and Swansea four days later. Southampton are at home against Bournemouth on the Saturday and at St Mary's again on the Wednesday when Crystal Palace are the visitors."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 1-1 Liverpool\nManchester City and Liverpool had to settle for a point apiece as they battled out a thrilling draw at Etihad Stadium.\nA hugely entertaining game was littered with talking points, astonishing misses and a sense of injustice for both sides as they felt they were on the receiving end of debatable decisions from referee Michael Oliver.\nJames Milner put Liverpool ahead against his former club with a penalty six minutes after the break, after Gael Clichy was penalised for a raised boot on Roberto Firmino.\nSergio Aguero scored against Liverpool for the fifth successive Premier League game at Etihad Stadium from Kevin de Bruyne's perfect cross after 69 minutes - before both sides wasted glorious opportunities to secure a vital win in the race for top-four places.\nAguero was particularly culpable, stumbling at the vital moment after his superb approach play had fashioned a clear chance eight yards out. After he fluffed his shot, De Bruyne hit the loose ball against the post.\nAdam Lallana produced a candidate for miss of the season when he somehow failed to tap Firmino's pass into an empty net before, in stoppage time, Aguero volleyed over the sort of chance he normally takes with comfort.\nRelive Sunday's Premier League action\nOne of my most special days in management - Guardiola\nThe game of missed opportunities\nThe scoreline only scratches at the surface of a game that was enthralling from start to finish, illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, who possess verve in attack but frailty in defence.\nCity and Liverpool both created and missed the sort of chances that could have turned one point into three and made life a little easier in the closing stages of the season.\nCity's Raheem Sterling could not find the final touch to David Silva's cross in the first half, with Fernandinho missing a presentable finish standing behind him.\nThe second half was when the real gifts were passed up.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp threatened to rip his cap off in a mixture of shock and disgust when Lallana, the ball presented on a plate by Firmino for what should have been a formality, somehow contrived to fail with his connection and the ball rolled apologetically away.\nSterling then lobbed Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet but the ball drifted wide - with City's real opportunity coming deep into stoppage time when Aguero sent a volley off target at the far post from another superb De Bruyne delivery.\nBoth sides had to settle for a draw - but both know it could have been so much more.\nTough afternoon for Oliver\nThe life of a referee was summed up by the sight and sound of Michael Oliver incurring the wrath of both sets of players at various points throughout a chaotic 90 minutes.\nLiverpool felt they were denied a penalty when Sadio Mane tumbled under a challenge from Nicolas Otamendi in the first half, although the striker also inadvertently made contact with his own leg as he shaped to shoot after escaping the City defender with embarrassing ease.\nYaya Toure was perhaps fortunate to only receive a yellow card after a wild lunge on Emre Can caught the Liverpool midfielder in the chest, while City were furious their penalty claims were ignored as Sterling went down under a challenge from Milner as he closed in on a finish in the six-yard area.\nCity's players were furious after Liverpool's penalty award - many continuing the discussion with Oliver long after Milner had completed the formalities - but Oliver got this big call right.\nClichy's foot was dangerously high on Firmino as he raced in on goal and Oliver had no hesitation in pointing to the spot.\nIt was a tough afternoon for the official as the big decisions came thick and fast.\nFrustration for Guardiola and Klopp\nCity boss Pep Guardiola and counterpart Klopp were both delighted with the performance from their teams - but the body language in the technical area also revealed huge frustration.\nVictory for either man would have been a crucial psychological blow as they fight for a place in the top four but both saw their teams waste the sort of chances that could have secured what they craved.\nGuardiola and Klopp were both animated in frustration in the first 45 minutes, especially at one point when they were united in mutual dissatisfaction in the technical area, the Catalan racing towards his opposite number for an exchange that concluded with a flamboyant high five.\nKlopp was leaping around in frustration, threatening to throw his cap to the floor as Liverpool squandered good positions, while Guardiola almost slumped to the turf in anguish after Aguero's later miss.\nCity remain a point ahead of Liverpool in third with a game in hand as Klopp's side lay fourth - while the result suited Manchester United best of all as they are now four points behind the Merseysiders with two games in hand after their win at Middlesbrough.\nMan of the match - David Silva\n'One of the happiest days of my career' - what the managers said\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola:\n\"Congratulations to Liverpool and Manchester City. It is one of the days I am proud the most.\n\"I have not had a long career as manager and it is one of the most special days of my life.\n\"The Champions League defeat was so tough for us and we recovered today with our mentality and attack, but we could not attack more because Liverpool are a top team.\n\"I want to stay here and help this club make a step forward and the battle to qualify for the Champions League will go until the last day.\n\"We played three days after going out of the Champions League. How the players suffer and fight to qualify against Barcelona, Borussia Monchengladbach, how we play in the second half against Monaco, to be out was so tough for all of us.\n\"The players in training did not speak. How they reacted against Liverpool means a lot.\"\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp:\n\"Our players did really well. I struggled on the final whistle to be really happy but it's a success to get a point at City and to play like this.\n\"It's more than OK what we did but we needed a bit more luck.\n\"The Sadio Mane situation - it was a red card and a penalty. In a game like this, it would've killed them.\n\"But maybe they could've and should've had a penalty too. 1-1 is better than nothing.\n\"They are too good to always defend perfectly. When we started playing football in the game, it was really difficult for them.\n\"Between 50 and 65 minutes we could have decided the game and we didn't.\n\"We can't speak today about faults and mistakes. Before the game, if someone told me I would get a point at City, I would have taken it.\"\nWhen Milner scores, Liverpool don't lose - stats\nCity have gone seven consecutive games without defeat in the Premier League (W4 D3 L0), their longest streak in the competition under Guardiola.\nLiverpool have won more points in 10 games against the top six this season (20) than they have in 10 games against the bottom six (19).\nMilner has scored seven penalties in the league this season - only Steven Gerrard (10 in 2013-14) has scored more for Liverpool in a Premier League campaign.\nMilner now holds the record for the most Premier League games scored in without losing (47 games: W37 D10 L0).\nOnly Gylfi Sigurdsson (11) has made more assists than De Bruyne (10) in the Premier League this season. The Belgian has assisted Aguero more times than any other player this term (3).\nCity have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their past 13 games in all competitions against Liverpool, shipping 24 in the process (W2 D5 L6).\nWhat's next?\nManchester City have another crucial period coming up after the international break which could decide their top-four status.\nFirst they travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Sunday, 2 April (16:00 BST) and three days later they face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, 5 April (20:00 BST).\nLiverpool's next Premier League fixture is not an easy one either - they host Everton in the Merseyside Derby on Saturday, 1 April (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-1 Everton\nLiverpool enhanced their prospects of a top-four place by beating derby rivals Everton, whose own hopes of breaking into the battle for a Champions League qualification spot were severely damaged by the defeat.\nSadio Mane gave the hosts an early lead when he played a one-two with Roberto Firmino and finished off an angled run with a shot into the far corner.\nA Philippe Coutinho shot was palmed up by Toffees keeper Joel Robles and headed off the line by Phil Jagielka before the visitors equalised.\nJagielka flicked on a corner at the near post and, after Ashley Williams got a touch, Matthew Pennington arrived to slot in his first Everton goal on his first appearance of the season.\nHowever, the match was level for just two minutes and 57 seconds before Coutinho beat two players and curled a shot into the top corner, and he then set up substitute Divock Origi - on for the injured Mane - to power in Liverpool's third.\nThe result leaves the Reds six points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United - who have two games in hand - while Everton are seven points off the top four having played more matches than their rivals.\nRelive Liverpool's win over Everton\nThe Liverpool bench was 'crazy' - Koeman\nFollow Saturday's other Premier League matches\nCoutinho sparkles but Mane injury a worry\nLiverpool hired a private jet to bring Coutinho and fellow Brazil international Firmino back after their country's win over Paraguay in midweek and will feel the move was worth it after the forward returned to form in style.\nCoutinho has struggled since recovering from an ankle injury in January but provided an assist as well as his goal as the Reds extended their unbeaten run against their Merseyside neighbours to 14 games in all competitions.\nThe 24-year-old was a picture of feints, shimmies and attacking runs at the Blues defence, and might have scored earlier if Robles and Jagielka had not combined to deny him.\nMane, who scored the winner in the reverse fixture, set the Reds on their way with his 13th goal of the season - but an injury in the second half will be a concern for Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who is already without attacking midfielder Adam Lallana for up to a month.\nSenegal winger Mane, Liverpool's top scorer this season, hurt himself trying to win the ball off Leighton Baines and, when he tried to put weight on his leg after treatment, collapsed.\n\"I've met Mane in the dressing room. It doesn't look too good,\" said Klopp.\nWhere was Romelu Lukaku?\nEverton striker Romelu Lukaku has been accused of going missing in the big games, despite being the Premier League's top scorer with 21 goals this season.\nThe Belgium international may have scored against top-four sides Manchester City and Tottenham during the present campaign, but he gave his critics further fuel after an ineffective display at Anfield.\nHe did not have his only touch in the Liverpool area until the 70th minute and he also failed to have a shot - on or off target - on the opposition goal.\n\"On today's showing, what you saw was a striker who didn't do enough to keep himself on the pitch,\" BBC Sport pundit Jason Roberts told Final Score.\n\"In these games where you need him to do a little bit more of the dogged work, he didn't offer that to his team. His head went down and that was the story of Everton.\"\nMidfielder Ross Barkley is also a key player for the Goodison Park club. However, he was also disappointing as he tested referee Anthony Taylor's patience with challenges on James Milner and Emre Can, before being booked for a late tackle on Dejan Lovren.\nReds hold upper hand on Merseyside\nEverton have not won at Anfield since September 1999 and they did little to alter the view that they have a psychological barrier at the home of their neighbours.\nEven having gone into the match with one defeat in 12 league games and four clean sheets in their past five games, they could not stop their hosts doing the double over them this season.\nHowever, there were mitigating circumstances with injuries to defenders Seamus Coleman and Ramiro Funes Mori forcing manager Ronald Koeman to replace them with right wing-back Mason Holgate, 20, and centre-back Pennington, 22.\nPennington did have the joy of scoring but was also caught out for Coutinho's goal as Liverpool widened the gap between the two teams to nine points.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho\nWhat they said:\nLiverpool manager Klopp on Barkley's challenge on Lovren: \"I'm still a kind of a guest in this country. How can I decide what is OK and what is not OK?\n\"My opinion is that the players should leave the pitch healthy and fit but not injured.\n\"It's not my job to judge it. If you saw something, say it. If not, be quiet.\"\nEverton boss Koeman: \"Maybe one or two tackles were a little too much. It's football, a derby.\n\"From both sides I saw tackles that were maybe more than a yellow. According to the bench of Liverpool - I don't mean the manager - the referee should have shown eight red cards.\"\nKlopp record - the stats you need to know\nKlopp is the first Liverpool manager to win his first three league Merseyside derbies against Everton.\nMane has scored in both Merseyside derbies this season, the first player to do that since Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge in 2013-14.\nMane has now been involved in 18 league goals this season (13 goals, five assists), his best return in a Premier League campaign.\nPennington became the fifth player - following Duncan Ferguson, John Arne Riise, Raul Meireles and Steven Naismith - to score his first Premier League goal in a Merseyside derby.\nOnly Olivier Giroud (seven) has scored more goals as a substitute than Divock Origi's six since the Belgium international's Premier League debut in September 2015.\nWhat next?\nThere is a fast turnaround in the top flight with a midweek programme in which Everton visit Manchester United on Tuesday for a 20:00 BST kick-off and Liverpool host Bournemouth on Wednesday, also at 20:00."

Teams come here just to defend. Goalkeepers come here to be man of the match. We cannot score a goal even when we are one on one.\n\"We beat everyone on quality of play and direction of the game, possession, creation and ambition - but we drew too many matches.\"\nWest Brom boss Tony Pulis told BBC Sport: \"If we won at the end, it would have been unjust. We are really pleased with the effort and commitment they put in today, United have some really good players. No matter how well set up you are, you will always be on your back foot.\n\"The group plays very well together, they play very compact but we had opportunities to spring out of it like against Arsenal. Their resilience and commitment was fantastic.\"\nWhat next?\nBoth teams have a quick turnaround. United come up against Everton in the Premier League on Tuesday (kick-off 20:00 BST), while West Brom face Watford on the same day (kick-off 19:45 BST).\nTheatre of Dreams or Screams? The stats\nThis is now Mourinho's longest unbeaten run in the Premier League (won 10, drawn nine) since October 2005 (40 games with Chelsea).\nUnited in total had 18 shots but only three were on target, while West Brom had just three shots in total - one on target.\nManchester United have drawn 0-0 at home eight times in the Premier League since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013. There were no goalless draws at home in the four years prior to that.\nWest Brom have failed to score in four of their past six league games at Old Trafford.\nHowever, the Baggies are just the second team in all competitions to stop Manchester United from scoring at home this season, along with Burnley.\nOnly Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois (13) has kept more clean sheets than De Gea in the Premier League this season (11)."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 Watford\nTottenham kept up the pressure on leaders Chelsea with an impressive home victory over Watford, their sixth consecutive Premier League win.\nWatford had started brightly, but Dele Alli's sumptuous strike - curled into the top corner after Son Heung-min's pass - signalled their quick decline.\nWithin just 11 more minutes they were three behind as Eric Dier smashed in from Son's deflected cross, before the South Korea forward added a third just before the break, firing in a rasping drive following Christian Eriksen's pass.\nAfter half-time it was much the same story, with Watford only threatening in isolated moments, and Son further confirmed Spurs' dominance by meeting Kieran Trippier's perfect cross with a lovely half-volley at the far post.\nHarry Kane, returning as a second-half substitute, struck the bar with an injury-time free-kick - the last kick of the game - and Son might have sealed his hat-trick from his earlier pass.\nMauricio Pochettino's side remain seven points adrift of Chelsea, who beat Bournemouth 3-1 later on Saturday.\nBut they are 14 points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who have two games in hand and play at Crystal Palace on Monday (20:00). Spurs have not finished above their north London rivals since 1995.\nRelive Spurs v Watford\nListen: Spurs fan tells 606 'Alli is already world-class'\nHarry who?\nIt was Vincent Janssen who led the line in Kane's absence from the starting line-up - and the Netherlands international missed another easy chance for the game's opening goal.\nTrippier - one of the standout performers, his delivery was brilliant throughout - crossed low from the right flank, taking out goalkeeper and defence, but Janssen could only awkwardly divert the ball onto the bar via the top of his thigh with the goal at his mercy.\nHis only goal in 23 Premier League games, since a \u00a317m summer arrival from AZ Alkmaar, remains a penalty against Leicester in October - and he was once again overshadowed by the dynamic and far more clinical Son.\nSon's second goal was particularly admirable, diverting another superb Trippier ball into the back of the net with a deftly controlled finish.\nBut the pick of the bunch was undoubtedly Alli's. The England midfielder's excellent season continued with a 13th goal from his past 15 league games. You will struggle to see a better one this weekend.\nHornets have an off day\nWatford beat Arsenal 2-1 away in late January, but this performance was a world away.\nThey might claim mitigating circumstances - it was something of a makeshift defence with Miguel Britos suspended and Younes Kaboul and Sebastian Prodl both injured - but once their positive start had faded, Spurs picked them off with ease.\nWalter Mazzarri's side had moved up to 10th in the league with two wins in a row, easing pressure on their manager, but the Italian will still be concerned by the possibility of a slide down the table in their remaining seven games.\nMazzarri has said he wants to stay, but the fate of Quique Sanchez Flores, who was fired at the end of last season with the club in 13th, will surely be at the forefront of his mind.\nThe race for the title\nTottenham, whose last league title came in 1961, need Chelsea to drop points if they are to overtake the Blues at the top of the league.\nBut even if they do not, a second-placed finish - which would be their highest in the Premier League - is looking likely.\nAlli tops Lampard, Gerrard and Beckham - the stats\nTottenham have won 11 Premier League home games in a row, their best winning streak at White Hart Lane since 1987 (14)\nWatford have won just once in their past 11 away league games (D2 L8)\nDele Alli has been directly involved in 14 goals in 13 Premier League games for Tottenham in 2017 (10 goals, 4 assists)\nAlli (40) has had a hand in as many Premier League goals before turning 21 as Frank Lampard (15), Steven Gerrard (13) & David Beckham (12) combined\nSon Heung-min has had a hand in five goals in his last three Premier League games (4 goals, 1 assist), after none in the five before that\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min\nEx-Wales striker John Hartson on BBC Radio 5 live:\n\"I would use the word sensational for Son. Every time he had the ball, other than his miss from that Harry Kane pass, he's been really, really good. A top class player and he got a big bear hug from his manager.\"\nWhat they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"Many things impressed me, we played really well. It is a massive result for us. We will keep pushing and keep believing.\n\"The team deserve full credit because the energy was fantastic. It was 4-0 but we deserved more goals. The players spoke for me on the pitch and I am very proud of that performance.\n\"We're second and the gap now is four but Chelsea have one game more to play. We will try to be there if Chelsea fail.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"We started really well and were playing at the same level as Tottenham, who are a phenomenal side. But it was really difficult after the three goals, that cut our legs.\n\"We had players who were tired from playing many games, it was a pity. But taking everything into consideration we are happy, and we have to look forward.\n\"We now have seven finals to play, and we are looking forward to building on this next year.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham play Bournemouth at home in the Premier League next Saturday, when Watford host relegation-threatened Swansea City."

        "article_text": "Burnley 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham cut the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to seven points as they overcame a stubborn Burnley at Turf Moor.\nThe visitors struggled in a drab first half as Dele Alli fired wide when well-placed and both central midfielders Victor Wanyama and Harry Winks were withdrawn through injury.\nWinks suffered a particularly nasty fall, tumbling into the Burnley dugout after trying to tackle Stephen Ward, before he was carried off on a stretcher at the interval.\nDespite a lack of attacking fluency, Spurs continued to exert pressure on the Clarets from corners, with Eric Dier firing in after the hosts failed to properly clear Christian Eriksen's delivery.\nVincent Janssen, making his first Premier League start of 2017, became the third Tottenham player forced off injured but that allowed the introduction of Son Heung-min.\nAnd the South Korea striker made sure of victory as he tapped in Alli's squared pass on 77 minutes as Spurs controlled the final stages.\nVictory, coupled with Chelsea's shock 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace, ensures Mauricio Pochettino's side stay in contention for the title with nine games remaining.\nReaction as Chelsea lose and Spurs close the gap on the leaders\nRelive the action at Turf Moor\nSon shines through\nA perennial worry with Tottenham is whether they possess the depth required to match the undoubted quality of their starting side and sustain a season-long challenge.\nVictory over Southampton in the absence of injured striker Harry Kane last time out suggested those concerns could be consigned to the past, only to reappear in the first half at Turf Moor.\nKyle Walker's deputy Kieran Tripper made several mistakes against his former club, Winks was guilty of trying to force passes in midfield and Janssen was again ineffective, lacking the pace and guile to test the organised duo of Michael Keane and Ben Mee.\nWhile not in the circumstances Spurs would have wanted, the added quality of Mousa Dembele and especially Son ultimately ensured a more comfortable afternoon.\nThe Korean's movement was vital in opening up a tiring Burnley as Alli made amends for his earlier uncharacteristic miss to calmly find the striker free to side-foot in.\nAfter the game, Pochettino said Kane could be back \"in a few weeks,\" yet in the meantime Son could again prove a stellar stand-in, while Janssen's spell on the sidelines looks set to resume.\nGritty Burnley run out of ideas\nBurnley's feted home form this season had seen them only lose to Arsenal, Manchester City and Swansea before this game and they once again followed a similar blueprint of pressing and cutting off lines of passing to frustrate superior opposition.\nAndre Gray and Ashley Barnes kept the Tottenham defence honest through the first half, while Keane and Mee easily repelled much of what Spurs attempted.\nYet the Clarets were undone by a rare lapse in concentration at a set-piece as Jeff Hendrick failed to firmly decide whether to let Eriksen's corner run or hack it clear, only to put the ball straight into Dier's path for the opener.\nThe hosts looked notably tired and bereft of ideas in the final 20 minutes as they fell to 15th, five points above the relegation zone.\nHome games against Stoke City, Manchester United, West Brom and West Ham during the run-in should see Sean Dyche's side pick up enough points to avoid a relegation scrap, but they may rue a missed opportunity to secure a point here.\nMan of the match - Eric Dier (Tottenham)\nTitle race restarted?\nAfter this season had started to look like a procession to the title for Chelsea, Saturday's results hint that a coronation of Antonio Conte's side remains premature.\nTottenham's challenge is tough - but not unprecedented.\nIn 2012, Manchester City overhauled an eight-point gap in six games to beat Manchester United to the title on goal difference.\nIf Spurs are to pull off a miraculous comeback, this victory could be the first step in a crucial week that sees Chelsea host Manchester City and Tottenham travel to relegation-threatened Swansea.\nManager reaction\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"We showed great character and I'm very proud and pleased because the performance in the second half was very good.\n\"This win is massive for us - we have to be there if Chelsea fail and we are there. We are fighting for the Premier League.\n\"When you reduce the gap to seven points it's completely different to 10 points - we just have to be there if Chelsea fail and want to be there until the end of the season.\"\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche: \"Up until the first goal we were solid and kept them from using the lines of passing that they like.\n\"We created some good positions but not good chances and then gave away a really poor goal.\n\"That lifted them and they looked more assured after that and showed what a tope side they are.\"\nTottenham on top in 2017 - match stats\nTottenham have won more points than any other Premier League team in 2017 (26).\nThis was Burnley's first home defeat by two or more goals in the Premier League since losing 1-3 against Everton in October 2014 (eight home defeats by a one-goal margin since).\nSon Heung-Min has scored eight goals in 25 Premier League games this season, doubling his tally from last season (four goals in 28 games).\nDele Alli has been involved in 11 goals in 11 Premier League games for Tottenham in 2017 so far (eight goals, three assists).\nEric Dier's goal was his first in the Premier League since December 2015 (vs Newcastle), and first away from home in the competition since August 2014 (vs West Ham).\nBurnley have now gone six Premier League games in April without scoring.\nWhat's next?\nBurnley host Stoke City at Turf Moor on Tuesday, with kick-off at 19:45 GMT, while Tottenham travel to Swansea on Wednesday, with kick-off also at 19:45 GMT."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-0 Stoke City\nLeicester City boss Craig Shakespeare continued his 100% winning start as a Premier League manager as his side edged further from the relegation zone with a convincing win over Stoke City at the King Power Stadium.\nThe Foxes, who have now won four consecutive league games, had the better of the opening stages before Wilfred Ndidi put them ahead with a superb strike from 25 yards out, the ball curling past Stoke goalkeeper Lee Grant and into the top corner.\nStoke were unable to put Leicester under any sustained pressure and paid the price when Jamie Vardy exploited the space in front of the goal to beat Glen Johnson and volley home.\nThe visitors grew into the second half but were left infuriated when Marko Arnautovic, after sliding Mame Diouf's pass into the net, was wrongly judged offside.\nGrant's agility in goal kept Leicester from scoring again but Peter Crouch fluffed a simple header from close range in the final minutes to add to Stoke's woes.\nThe result means that Shakespeare, who took over at the club in February, is the first British manager to win his first four Premier League games in charge.\nThe Foxes are now 13th in the league and six points clear of the relegation zone, while Stoke, who have only won three away league games this season, remain ninth.\nRelive the action as Leicester beat Stoke City\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nLeicester 'not safe' from relegation says Shakespeare\nFoxes grow in confidence\nWhen Shakespeare took over at Leicester the Foxes were low on confidence, hovering one point above the relegation zone and searching for the fluency and unity they had last season as they won the Premier League title.\nThey will face sterner tests than Stoke as the season winds down but they looked fresh and energetic here, with Demarai Gray outpacing Stoke's defence throughout the match.\nThe Foxes, for all their struggles, are the only Premier League side yet to drop a point from a winning position this season and Ndidi put them ahead in emphatic style, taking a touch from Danny Simpson's cross before volleying powerfully past Grant.\nVardy's goal - his 11th of the season - brought back memories of last year's successful campaign as he darted around Johnson to meet Simpson's floated cross, and he received a standing ovation from the Foxes fans as he left the pitch.\nThe home side dominated possession and were only denied a further goal by Grant's athleticism, the Stoke keeper twice diving at full-stretch to deny the Foxes.\nStoke struggles on the road continue\nStoke have picked up just four points away from home since the start of December, and their fragile defence against Leicester hinted at those struggles.\nWhile Leicester looked rejuvenated after the international break, Stoke seemed more cautious. They struggled to find their feet as Leicester continued to press, and Gray and Riyad Mahrez were able to work the ball into the box with relative ease.\nWhen they attacked, they looked more solid, with Joe Allen twice sending well-flighted deliveries into the box, but their final touches lacked enough quality.\nThe offside decision against Arnautovic came when Stoke were on top, pushing Leicester's defence, and they struggled to regain that fluency afterwards.\nIt means Stoke have failed to score in four consecutive top-flight away games - their worst run since a five-match streak between January and March 2011.\nShakespeare joins big-hitting names\nPep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho, Guus Hiddink and Carlo Ancelotti are the other four managers to win their first four Premier League matches in charge.\nShakespeare is a more unassuming figure than some of those names but has undoubtedly had a positive effect on Leicester, with the Foxes showing more belief in their play.\n\"I am proud of the record but I'm proud for everyone associated with the football club, especially the players,\" Shakespeare said after the match.\nHe has overseen a turn in form that has seen Leicester reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League and begin to look more composed.\nTheir defence still has moments of weakness but Leicester seem more controlled and more willing to attack. Gray's extra pace has lifted them while Vardy, Riyad Mahrez and Shinji Okazaki seem to have found a fluidity that was missing for much of the season.\nMan of the match - Demarai Gray (Leicester City)\nVardy's good run continues - the stats you need to know\nCraig Shakespeare is the first British manager to win each of his first four Premier League games.\nLeicester City have won three successive home games in the Premier League for the first time since February 2016 - a run that also included a victory against Stoke City.\nLeicester had 10 shots on target against Stoke; their most in a Premier League game since 2003-04.\nThe Potters have failed to score in four consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since March 2011 (five in a row).\nJamie Vardy has been directly involved in six goals in his last four Premier League games (four goals and two assists).\nThe England striker has now either scored or assisted in each of his last four Premier League outings; his longest such run in the competition since December 2015 (a run of 15).\nBoth of Wilfred Ndidi's goals for Leicester City have been scored from outside the box (one in the Premier League, one in the FA Cup).\nStoke have now kept just one clean sheet in their last eight Premier League away games (won one, drew one, lost six).\nDanny Simpson assisted both of Leicester's goals, while his only other assist in the competition came in his first Premier League appearance (October 2007 for Man Utd v Wigan).\nWhat the managers said\nLeicester City manager Craig Shakespeare: \"I always thought there was moments in the game where Stoke came back into it.\n\"I always thought the first goal in the game would be crucial. It gave us a foothold in the game. The second goal just after half-time gave us that confidence to go on and win the game.\n\"We're still not safe. I'm really not looking too far ahead - we've got to concentrate on each game and there's still a lot of points of play for. We're on a good run and full of confidence but we've got another tough game against Sunderland.\"\nStoke City manager Mark Hughes: \"We didn't perform. What you don't want to happen is to go behind against Leicester. It becomes more of a basketball game, end to end, and we ended up chasing the game.\n\"Whatever we said at half-time didn't work because straight away we conceded the second. From that moment it was difficult to see a way back for us.\n\"We never produced the quality that was required. It was not a great day for us and we didn't make it hard enough for Leicester. We've got a difficult fixture against Burnley and we will have to be better than we were today.\"\nWhat's next?\nLeicester host Premier League strugglers Sunderland at the King Power Stadium on 4 April (19:45 BST) while Stoke are away at Burnley on the same day (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 1-2 Crystal Palace\nChelsea's lead at the top of the Premier League was cut to seven points after they suffered a shock home defeat by Crystal Palace and Tottenham beat Burnley.\nAntonio Conte's side had won their past 10 league games at Stamford Bridge and had not lost there in any competition since 16 September, but saw that run ended by a battling Eagles side.\nThe Blues struck first, when Cesc Fabregas turned home Eden Hazard's cross after five minutes, but they were quickly behind.\nWilfried Zaha produced a fine solo finish to turn and fire home from the edge of the box and, 91 seconds later, set up Christian Benteke to put Palace ahead with a delicate dinked effort.\nChelsea piled on the pressure and had 24 shots at goal, their second-highest total in 29 league games this season.\nBut they could find no way past Eagles keeper Wayne Hennessey, who made 11 saves in total to ensure his side won a fourth successive game.\nRelive the game at Stamford Bridge\nReaction from Saturday's other Premier League matches\nChelsea cannot find a way through\nThe international break cannot have helped Chelsea's rhythm but that did not seem a problem when Hazard, back from a calf injury, and Fabregas combined early on.\nPutting Pedro in as right wing-back in place of the absent Victor Moses did not seem to cause the leaders too many issues either, as many of their best attacks came down that flank.\nA drop in energy levels might have played a part in places, however. N'Golo Kante, who played 90 minutes for France against Spain in midweek, was noticeably below par in the centre of midfield.\nMore than 10 minutes of stoppage time was played before the game ended, but Chelsea did not appear any more likely to score and were reduced to hopeful balls into the box as Hazard's influence faded.\nAntonio Conte's side remain in a strong position at the top of the table but, if tiredness was an issue against the Eagles, it could affect them again in the next few days.\nChelsea's lack of European involvement means they are not used to playing in midweek, and only 13 different players have started 22 league games for them since 1 October.\nWith two games in the next seven days, at home to Manchester City and away at Bournemouth, Conte may have to test the strength in depth of his squad for the first time.\nHennessey the hero\nDespite their lack of sparkle, Chelsea's defeat was not down to a lack of chances - but, when they did break down Palace's determined defence, they found Hennessey in inspired form.\nHis best save was an instinctive stop from Diego Costa in the first half but every facet of the Wales international's game was tested as Chelsea tried to find a way back into the game after going behind.\nHennessey had to move quickly to keep out Marcos Alonso's dangerous cross-shot, dash from his line to prevent Costa from stretching to poke the ball home, and was also tested from distance by Nemanja Matic.\nHe was helped by his defenders when dealing with the sheer number of crosses from the home side - 35 in total, 12 more than they have previously made in any league game under Conte - but superbly marshalled a back-line that changed twice during the game because of injuries to James Tomkins and then Scott Dann.\nMan of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)\n'We must accept this result' - what the managers said\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte speaking to Match of the Day: \"This is football. We must accept this result.\n\"We scored our goal after five minutes and then we conceded two in a few minutes. When you concede goals in that way you must understand the situation and improve on these mistakes.\n\"In every game in England, anything can happen. The league is so strong. We faced a team today with strong players. I think they showed they were a good team.\n\"Now we have to think about the next game. If we had won we would have been happy but now it's important to focus on Manchester City.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"I think our performance is typical of what seems to be the character of the side. It's the first time we've gone behind so early. The determination has shone through. We knew we were going to be pegged back.\n\"The defence was outstanding, the goalkeeper was outstanding. We could have scored more.\n\"It's a sweet three points, to come to the champions - or who I think are going to be champions - and win. This is what the Premier League is about. There can be a shock anywhere. It will make people sit up and say wow.\"\nWhat next? Man City come to Stamford Bridge\nPalace remain four points clear of the relegation zone, with a game in hand on third-bottom Hull, and a vastly superior goal difference. They are on the road again in midweek, and travel to Southampton on Wednesday (19:45 BST).\nChelsea have a chance to make immediate amends on home turf when they host Manchester City on the same night (20:00).\nAllardyce beats Chelsea again - the stats you need to know\nAllardyce is the first manager to win a Premier League game against Chelsea with four different clubs.\nFabregas scored in his 43rd Premier League game, but this was the first time he had been on the losing side.\nBenteke has scored in his past three Premier League appearances at Stamford Bridge, each with a different club (Aston Villa, Liverpool and Crystal Palace).\nChelsea conceded two goals in the opening 11 minutes of a Premier League home game for the first time since October 1995 (v Manchester United)."

He ended the half with a clattering challenge on Ranocchia, dazing the Italian and underlining his menace.\nYet Hull's switch to a four-man defence completely altered the contest. More cover on the wings strangled the supply line to Carroll, who only had one chance of note in the second half with a header straight at Jakupovic.\nHull's equaliser was as well worked as it was well deserved, after which there only looked like being one winner, particularly when N'Diaye thumped against the post and Grosicki fired just wide on the rebound.\nRanocchia duly delivered the killer punch late on, but in truth it was a self-inflicted wound for the Hammers, who allowed the Italian too much space at the near post as the visitors' set-piece weaknesses were exposed again.\nMan of the match - Andrew Robertson (Hull City)\nGrosicki makes his mark - match stats\nKamil Grosicki became the first Hull player to assist twice in a Premier League game.\nAndy Carroll opened the scoring with his 50th Premier League goal. He is the 44th English player to reach that milestone.\nAaron Cresswell provided the assist for Carroll's goal; it was his 10th in the Premier League since joining West Ham in 2014\nThree of Cresswell's last four Premier League assists have been for Andy Carroll.\nHull's goalscorers Andrew Robertson and Andrea Ranocchia scored their first ever Premier League goals, by netting in this match.\nWest Ham have lost 20 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, the most of any side in the competition.\nMarco Silva hasn't lost a home league match as a manager in over three years: (W32 D7 L0) with four clubs (Estoril, Sporting, Olympiakos and Hull).\nAndy Carroll has played the full 90 minutes in four successive league games for the first time since April 2014.\n'Very hard to take' - manager quotes\nHull head coach Marco Silva: \"We changed some things [at half-time], the system. I think we changed our confidence as well.\n\"In the first half we were too slow, in the second half we played with more confidence. We had a great 25 minutes at the start of the second half. We scored one goal and could have had more. One off the post. I think we deserve this victory.\n\"It was really important. In our stadium with our fans we are stronger. All the games now are important. We showed again this afternoon how strong we are when we play at home.\"\nOn the fight against relegation: \"It's our goal. Since we came we have said that. It's difficult. It's important we had a good performance this afternoon but we need to fight until the end of the season for sure.\n\"This result gives confidence but this game is finished and Middlesbrough is another game.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"I was very satisfied [at half-time]. We were winning, they didn't have have a shot on target, we neutralised them.\n\"It was all good until they equalised. They had five minutes of a good spell but then we came back again. To concede a set-piece again, it is very hard to take. We conceded two against Leicester, one against Bournemouth, it's no good.\n\"Ranocchia was basically in that position alone, and we didn't mark him.\"\nOn the shrinking gap to the bottom three: \"They are making up ground. It's very open and they are closing the gap. With a point we are keeping them nine points behind us, but now it's six.\"\nOn his future: \"I'm doing my job. I'm motivated. But if we are doing so many mistakes then you will pay the price.\"\nWhat's next?\nA massive midweek encounter is next up for Hull as they play host to second-bottom Middlesbrough on Wednesday night (19:45 BST). West Ham are in action at the same time, making the trip across London to play Arsenal at Emirates Stadium."

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-0 Bournemouth\nHarry Arter blazed over a late penalty for Bournemouth in their goalless Premier League draw against south coast rivals Southampton.\nThe visiting midfielder slipped while taking his spot-kick with 13 minutes to go - awarded after Ryan Bertrand's tug on Ryan Fraser - which ended up high in the stand behind Fraser Forster's goal.\nBoth sides struck the post in the contest - Dusan Tadic's curled effort for Southampton and Adam Smith's low drive for the away side.\nAndrew Surman's poked effort was cleared off the line by England international James Ward-Prowse, while Jay Rodriguez's thumping drive forced Cherries goalkeeper Artur Boruc into a reflex save.\nThe two strikers for each team should have done better when presentable opportunities fell to them in the box, but both Benik Afobe and Saints' Shane Long failed to hit the target with their efforts.\nRelive the goalless draw from St. Mary's\nArter bends it like Beckham\nAmusing for those watching, but not for the player himself.\nArter's left foot gave way at the point of contact with the ball, meaning he was off balance and ended up horribly shanking his penalty deep into the south stand at St Mary's.\nIt was similar to former England captain David Beckham's penalty against Portugal at Euro 2004, losing his standing foot and smashing his effort over the crossbar.\nArter tried to make amends with a couple of minutes remaining, but his well-struck shot from the edge of the area was pushed away by Forster.\n'I didn't intentionally miss'\nBournemouth midfielder Harry Arter on his penalty miss: \"I feel if I score we would have got three points. I didn't intentionally miss. As much as it is disappointing it is part and parcel of football.\n\"It is my fault, one of the lads said Harry Kane did something similar, maybe they need to have a look at it.\"\nMid-table comforts\nThe result leaves Southampton in 10th place, one position above Bournemouth with both sides on 34 points. The Saints have played two fewer games because of their run to the EFL Cup final.\nEddie Howe's side had been looking over their shoulders having started 2017 without winning their first eight league games, but they have collected 10 points from their last four games to climb seven clear of the relegation zone.\nMeanwhile, Claude Puel's men continue to perform steadily and have lost just once in their last four games.\nMan of the match - Artur Boruc (Bournemouth)\n'A draw is normal'\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel tells BBC Sport: \"When you play the first game after the international break it is always difficult. Bournemouth have just three international players. It is not an excuse. We had opportunities to score but a draw is normal.\n\"We had good intensity at the beginning. Without scoring it is difficult, the opponent took confidence and it was difficult to finish.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It should have been three wins in a row. We were not great in the first half but in the second we dominated the game and had great chances put the game to bed.\"\nWhat next?\nSouthampton host Crystal Palace on Wednesday (kick-off 19:45 BST), while Bournemouth travel to face Liverpool on the same day (kick-off 20:00 BST).\nBournemouth love the woodwork - the stats\nSouthampton remain unbeaten against Bournemouth on home soil, having won eight and drawn five matches.\nBournemouth have kept back-to-back clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since March 2016.\nEddie Howe's side are now unbeaten in their last four league games, their longest such run since October 2016 (also four).\nRyan Fraser has won more penalties than any other player in the Premier League this season (5).\nThe Cherries are the first side since Crystal Palace in October 2016 to miss three penalties in a row in the Premier League.\nDusan Tadic had the most shots and created the most chances for Southampton in this match (four each).\nNo team has hit the woodwork more times than Bournemouth in the Premier League this season (16)."

        "article_text": "Swansea City 0-0 Middlesbrough\nSwansea City and Middlesbrough produced a stale goalless draw which did little to enhance either team's prospects of avoiding relegation from the Premier League.\nBoth sides created chances in a high-octane opening but the pace soon faltered as the players seemed gripped by tension.\nSwansea's Leroy Fer wasted a fine opportunity as he blazed over from close range in the 89th minute while Rudy Gestede headed wide for the visitors in added time.\nThe Swans remain one place and one point above the bottom three, while Boro stay 19th and five points adrift of safety.\nWins for relegation rivals Crystal Palace and Hull City on Saturday increased the pressure on each team to win, and a draw represents a missed opportunity for both.\nRelive the action from the Liberty Stadium\nNo reward for caution\nSwansea seemed to be pulling clear of trouble with five wins in their first eight games following head coach Paul Clement's appointment, but two successive defeats had dragged the Swans back into the mire.\nFor Boro, the onus on victory was even greater. Winless in 11, the last time they had won a Premier League game was way back in December - a 3-0 triumph against a Swansea side in the midst of Bob Bradley's ill-fated reign.\nThis had the hallmarks of a tight, nervy relegation battle, but the opening quarter was played at a breathless pace with both teams refreshingly eager to attack.\nAfter a handful of chances at either end, however, the game disintegrated into a disjointed encounter in which neither team seized the initiative.\nSwansea's attack lacked its focal point with top scorer Fernando Llorente injured, while Boro seldom looked like scoring their first away league goal of 2017.\nBoth teams had chances in the closing stages - Gylfi Sigurdsson twice went close for the hosts with a long-range shot and a deflected free-kick - but ultimately paid the price for their caution.\nMan of the match - Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough)\nAgnew's audition\nMiddlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew had said he wanted the manager's job on a permanent basis, and the club's owner Steve Gibson suggested the 51-year-old could be \"the glue to unify us completely\".\nAgnew had started his temporary reign with a 3-1 home defeat against Manchester United, and he gave an indication of his attacking intent at the Liberty Stadium by recalling winger Adama Traore.\nThe rapid former Barcelona player was the most potent threat for the visitors, who had mustered a division-low tally of 20 Premier League goals so far this season.\nTraore, sporting a distinctive new bleached blonde haircut, found space between Swansea's midfield and defence and ran at them at pace, drawing fouls and spreading panic among his opponents.\nDespite Traore's forays, Boro looked blunt in attack. Fortunately for Agnew's men, so did Swansea's against a visiting defence whose 33 goals conceded this season make it the fifth best in the league.\nWhat the managers said\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: \"Any point you get is valuable but we are disappointed not to win the game.\n\"They had a big chance at the end but they didn't have an attempt on target in the whole game so a defeat would have been harsh.\n\"You never know how valuable that point could be. It is tight at the bottom, there are eight games to go and we remain very positive.\"\nMiddlesbrough caretaker manager Steve Agnew: \"You could see that the fight is there. The spirit is terrific.\n\"Swansea have been in the Premier League for seven years, and this is our first season. It was difficult for us to sustain attacks but we kept going right to the end.\n\"You'd expect Rudy Gestede to score at the end but when the next chance comes I'm sure he will.\n\"It's another point and we will regroup.\"\nRudy can't win - match stats\nMiddlesbrough have drawn more Premier League games 0-0 this season than any other team in the competition (6).\nMiddlesbrough (9) have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League team currently in the bottom six.\nOnly West Brom (8) have registered one or fewer shots on target in more different PL games this season than Middlesbrough (6).\nRudy Gestede has now gone 39 Premier League games without a win (last won v Bournemouth, August 2015); extending the competition record for the longest winless run by a player.\nSwansea didn't make a substitution in a Premier League game for the first time ever.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea host Tottenham at 19:45 BST on Wednesday, before travelling to West Ham on Saturday, with kick-off at 15:00 BST.\nMiddlesbrough face another relegation battle away at Hull City at 19:45 BST on Wednesday, before hosting Burnley at 15:00 BST on Saturday."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-2 Manchester City\nArsenal showed signs of recovery from their recent dismal run of form as they twice fought back from behind to draw with Manchester City at Emirates Stadium.\nThe Gunners had lost four out of their previous five Premier League games, and faced City against uncertainty surrounding manager Arsene Wenger's future, with more protests staged before kick-off.\nArsenal got off to the worst possible start when Leroy Sane put City ahead after only five minutes, running on to Kevin de Bruyne's routine pass to round David Ospina and score.\nTheo Walcott capped a spell of Arsenal pressure to scramble home an equaliser five minutes before the break - but they were on terms for only two minutes before Sergio Aguero's powerful finish put City back in front.\nArsenal lost Laurent Koscielny to injury at half-time and it was his central defensive partner Shkodran Mustafi who rose above City's defence from a corner to restore parity after 53 minutes.\nAguero missed two good chances for City and manager Pep Guardiola was furious that a late handball appeal against Nacho Monreal was ignored, leaving his side in fourth and Arsenal in sixth place in the table - seven points of the top-four pace.\nListen: Top-four finish out of Arsenal's grasp - Keown\nRelive the draw at Emirates Stadium\nWhat does this mean for Wenger?\nTwo banners were held aloft at the final whistle - and both summed up the confusion currently surrounding Arsenal and manager Wenger.\nOne read \"Forever In Your Debt - One Arsene Wenger\" and the other carried the slogan \"All Good Things Must Come To An End.\"\nThere were renewed protests from a noisy, but relatively small, group of Arsenal fans before kick-off to illustrate the pressure on Arsenal's manager but there were precious few signs of discontent inside the stadium.\nThe smart money remains on Wenger extending a stay as manager that stretches back to October 1996 - but this result and performance did little either way to clear the muddied waters around this part of north London.\nWenger insists his decision is made while Arsenal's board say the next move will be mutual - so a draw almost summed up what seems to be the current inertia among the decision-makers.\nIf Arsenal had won, it would certainly have made any announcement more palatable, while a loss would have made it a harder sell.\nAs it is, a draw means the uncertainty goes on.\nArsenal show signs of life\nArsenal needed to show signs of fight and resilience after a desperate sequence of four defeats in their previous five Premier League games - and they certainly showed that, if not huge quality.\nThe Gunners twice fought back from behind in a performance that was centred on determination rather than the dazzling football of old, but Wenger can at least take some comfort from that small mercy.\nArsenal's wafer-thin confidence was exposed by the manner in which they defended for both City goals, opened up too easily by De Bruyne's routine pass for Sane's opener and losing concentration and shape far too easily to concede a second to Aguero two minutes after Walcott's equaliser.\nThey still display very obvious defensive faults and the Achilles injury to Koscielny, the most reliable member of their rearguard, could prove to be a significant setback in the run-in.\nThis is a frail Arsenal side, reduced in self-belief by that recent poor run, but avoiding defeat here may just build some momentum as they chase a place in the Premier League's top four.\nCity miss big chance\nCity may have been offered just the slightest hope of a route back into the title race by Chelsea's surprise loss at home to Crystal Palace - and a win here against Arsenal would have further cemented their place in the top four.\nSo a draw represents a real missed opportunity for Guardiola and his players, who failed to take advantage of the perfect start given to them by Sane's goal.\nCity cut Arsenal apart in the opening phases, when De Bruyne hit the post and Ospina saved well from David Silva.\nGuardiola's side play some scintillating attacking football but must discover a ruthless streak, with even the world-class Aguero missing inviting headed chances either side of Mustafi's equaliser.\nCity, without question, are fashioning an exciting attacking side with Sane, Aguero, Raheem Sterling, De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus to come back, but this was another example of them being a work in progress.\nWhat the managers said\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We were nervous and surprised by their start. I feared that we could start with the handbrake on because of the pressure we are under.\n\"We are in a tough battle for the top four. I am professional and I have shown great loyalty in the past.\n\"I love this club, I don't know how long I will be here, I am clear in my head, that's the most important thing. The decision will be soon.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We didn't play in the first half, after the goal we forgot to play, the desire went. In the second half we played more.\n\"We suffered a lot in the first half because we did not make those passes together.\n\"On Wednesday we play against a team [Chelsea] who is stable in what they do. We don't have too much time to prepare but we go back to Manchester now and recover and then come back to London.\"\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Manchester City)\nNo stopping De Bruyne - match stats\nArsenal have lost just one of 20 home Premier League matches against Manchester City (W12 D7).\nKevin de Bruyne has assisted 11 Premier League goals this season, the joint-most in the division along with Gylfi Sigurdsson; only once before has a City player assisted more goals in a single Premier League season (David Silva with 15 in 2011/12).\nDavid Silva registered his 100th Premier League goal involvement with an assist for Aguero's goal - the Spaniard has scored 37 goals and assisted 63 since his debut in August 2010. His tally of 63 assists is 12 more than any other player since his debut.\nSane's goal after four minutes and 22 seconds was the earliest Premier League goal Arsenal had conceded at the Emirates since February 2012, when Louis Saha scored after three minutes and 51 seconds for Spurs.\nTen of Sergio Aguero's 14 Premier League goals this season have come away from home (71%).\nMesut Ozil has assisted four Premier League goals against Man City, the joint-most he has managed against an opponent (level with Aston Villa).\nMesut Ozil's assist in this game was his 50th for Arsenal in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nThere is a full round of Premier League fixtures in midweek. Arsenal face West Ham at home on Wednesday evening, while Manchester City face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge."

Sebastian Prodl was also taken off with a rib problem in the first half.\nMan of the match - M'Baye Niang\nAnother record for Deeney\nTroy Deeney is the first Watford player to score in four consecutive home Premier League games. He has had a hand in seven goals in his last eight league appearances, scoring six and assisting one.\nWatford have kept consecutive Premier League clean sheets for the first time since October 2016 (three in a row).\nWest Brom are without a win in their last six Premier League away games (D3 L3).\nMiguel Britos is just the third player to pick up two red cards in the PL this season, alongside Fernandinho and Granit Xhaka.\nManager reaction\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"I'm very happy for my team. The players played very well. It was a great game.\n\"I said before the game they were a good side and had two good results against Man United and Arsenal.\n\"It was a beautiful goal by Niang. Also the assist was good from Deeney.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We gave two poor goals away. We still had chances and possessions. Chadli could come out another day with a hat-trick, so we are disappointed.\n\"The lads kept working but it wasn't our night. We needed a break and they had it.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Brom host Southampton on Saturday, while Watford travel to Tottenham on the same day in the early kick-off (12:30 BST)."

Five out of our seven games have been away and the two at home against the top two.\n\"We knew it was a tough run and to come out with a deserved win is pleasing.\n\"We have played big games at Turf Moor, the players are adapting.

        "article_text": "Leicester City 2-0 Sunderland\nLeicester made it six wins from six under boss Craig Shakespeare as seemingly doomed Sunderland marked the two-month anniversary of their last goal with another defeat.\nThe Foxes looked below their recent best for the first hour, but Shakespeare's decision to bring on Marc Albrighton and Islam Slimani was the game-changing moment.\nSeven minutes after coming on, Albrighton's left-wing cross was headed home by Algeria striker Slimani.\nAlbrighton then ran from halfway before crossing to Jamie Vardy, who took a touch before firing an unstoppable effort into the top corner.\nSunderland - in the first game since boss David Moyes' comments that a BBC reporter might \"get a slap\" were made public - are increasingly looking destined for the Championship.\nWithout a victory or a goal since 4 February, the Black Cats are eight points adrift of Premier League safety with only eight games left.\nTheir best chance came 96 seconds before Vardy's goal when Victor Anichebe's deflected shot hit the post, with Jermain Defoe smashing the rebound into the side of the net.\nRelive the game and follow reaction here\nMoyes 'never feared for job'\nBBC Radio Leicester reaction to Foxes win\nFoxes revival under Shakespeare continues\nLeicester are a team reborn under Claudio Ranieri's replacement Shakespeare, who became the first British manager to win his first four Premier League games at the weekend. He has extended that record to five.\nWhile beating Sunderland is not as eye-catching as his opening victory over Liverpool, or the win over Sevilla in the Champions League, it took them into the top half of the table and nine points above the relegation zone.\nThe hosts were below par in the first half - think Ranieri's side of earlier this season rather than the Italian's title winners of last year. But after the break, more specifically after Shakespeare's changes, they took control.\nAlbrighton, returning from an illness, had a hand in both goals - his cross setting up Slimani's first Leicester goal of 2017.\nVardy's goal was his fifth in five Premier League games under Shakespeare. He took 22 matches to score that many under Ranieri this campaign.\nIn the end it was a comfortable win for the Foxes, who could have won by more after dominating the final 30 minutes of the match.\nThey became only the second team in Premier League history to lose five consecutive games and then win their next five, following on from Tottenham in October-December 2004.\nMoyes' woes continue with another defeat\nShakespeare is enjoying the golden touch at Leicester, while Moyes' team look doomed.\nThe latest defeat came on the back of criticism for his comments to a BBC reporter after being unhappy with her line of questioning. After the interview last month he told Vicki Sparks she \"might get a slap even though you're a woman\" and told her to be \"careful\" next time.\nHe apologised and the club have stood by him. After the Foxes game he said \"the matter's finished\".\nHis problems at the moment are both on and off the field.\nMoyes' men were not awful in the first half, matching Leicester for the most part. But a series of weak headers and long-range shots were all they really offered, Anichebe's second-half chance aside.\nBut it is a sixth game in a row without a goal, with only one point during that time.\nThey now need at least three wins, realistically a few more than that, from their final eight games to stay up. With five victories from their opening 30 league matches, those odds look slim.\nThere were positives from the game - Lee Cattermole made his first appearance since September following a hip injury. But he was shown a yellow card for a trip on Demarai Gray. Anichebe also returned from injury, with his first outing since January.\nThe story of their season can perhaps best be summed up by this - Anichebe remains their joint-second top scorer this season with defender Patrick van Aanholt [now at Crystal Palace] on three goals. He is 11 behind Defoe, who never really looked like scoring at Leicester despite a few half chances.\nMan of the match - Marc Albrighton\n'Sunderland are doomed' - BBC analysis\nFormer Republic of Ireland defender Mark Lawrenson on BBC Radio 5 live: \"Sunderland are doomed, I'm afraid to say.\n\"It's been a strange year for them and that's come on the back of a few strange years.\n\"They have had lots of different managers and therefore lots of different backroom staff and then lots of different players. Maybe losing Sam Allardyce to the England job in the summer didn't help - it could be a different story now if that hadn't happened.\n\"But nowhere along the line has there been any clear plan.\n\"But sometimes it's not the worst thing in the world to go down to the Championship. Newcastle have proved you can go down and make yourself stronger.\n\"They will be a big club in the Championship - it's a dog-eat-dog league and you've got to have some guts to come straight back up but it's possible.\"\nFormer Black Cats defender Gary Bennett, now a BBC Newcastle pundit: \"The fans are obviously not happy with the results, especially tonight. The supporters were excellent, as they have been all season.\n\"I could not hear any particular support or criticism of David Moyes tonight from the fans.\"\n'It's desperate now' - manager reaction\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"I'm really disappointed we didn't get something out of the game. We played really well for 60 minutes. If we'd been in front, nobody could have complained.\n\"At Everton we were 1-0 down and hit the bar - like today. Small margins are important. We just didn't get it today. It's desperate now.\n\"I felt we had to win one of these past two games. The boys have given a good go of it. We have maybe lacked a bit of quality.\n\"We'll keep going again - it's still in our hands to stay up.\"\nLeicester boss Craig Shakespeare: \"We weren't at our best tonight but the most important thing was the win.\n\"We know we can play better than that. We're trying to put as many points on the board as we can.\n\"There's been no talk of it [next week's Champions League quarter-final first leg with Atletico Madrid].

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 Everton\nZlatan Ibrahimovic rescued an injury-time draw for Manchester United against Everton as Jose Mourinho's side once again failed to win in the league at Old Trafford.\nThe Swede's 94th-minute penalty was awarded after Luke Shaw's goal-bound shot was handled on the line by visiting defender Ashley Williams, who was given a red card.\nThe point means United extend their unbeaten run to 20 games, but have now drawn nine times at home in the league and 12 overall, while opponents Everton missed the chance to leapfrog them in the table.\nEverton's opener came through Phil Jagielka's clever, flicked finish from close range when he had his back to goal.\nIn response to going behind, Ander Herrera struck the crossbar after Joel Robles parried Daley Blind's free-kick and the United midfielder also forced Toffees goalkeeper Robles into a full-stretch save.\nPaul Pogba came on for the second half and headed against the bar from Ashley Young's free-kick, while Ibrahimovic had a goal disallowed for offside in a disjointed United performance.\nRelive the draw from Old Trafford\nLouis van Mourinho?\nUnited were staring at defeat for the first time since their 4-0 drubbing against Chelsea in October before Ibrahimovic's coolly taken penalty which sent Robles the wrong way.\nThe striker said before kick-off that he and the club are \"still in talks\" about signing a new deal for next season and they are indebted to the Swede for his 27 goals this term, many of which have been on important occasions.\nIt was a huge let-off for the hosts, who had 61.5% possession and 18 shots, but only three on target, showing their obvious weakness in front of goal.\nMuch of United's play was in front of the Everton backline - often sideways and ponderous - without displaying any real strategy to breakdown the opposition.\nPrevious boss Louis van Gaal's slow style of play was criticised by the supporters, but United's last two performances have been a throwback to those days.\nIn fact, after 29 games in his first season, Van Gaal claimed 56 points and were fourth in the league, while Mourinho has two fewer points and are a place further back.\nSubstitution confusion and mistrust\nIn an attempt to get back into the contest, world record signing Pogba replaced left-back Daley Blind at half time.\nA reshuffle to the side meant Herrera dropped to Blind's previous position, allowing Pogba to take up his role in the middle of the park.\nBut less than five minutes later, Herrera swapped positions with Young to go to the right-back spot.\nAll this took place with full-backs Matteo Darmian and Luke Shaw - whose commitment has been questioned by the manager - sitting on the bench.\nShaw did come on just after the hour mark but only after an injury to Young, while Henrikh Mkhitaryan - dropped as Mourinho was \"not happy\" with his performance in the previous match against West Brom - replaced Michael Carrick.\nThe confusion from his players and the muddled changes from boss Mourinho showed the apparent mistrust he holds towards his squad as they struggle to find cohesion and incisiveness.\nA busy April for United has started with two draws, with five further league and two Europa League games to play.\nAnalysis - Fellaini like a six-year-old\nFormer Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson on BBC Radio 5 live:\nFrom Manchester United, it was a dog's dinner of a performance. They had no idea who was playing where and they played that way. They have gone away with one point but should have had none.\nUnited were absolutely all over the place. I cannot see what they were trying to achieve here. They had no shape about them at all.\nWhere was Marouane Fellaini even playing? One second he is trying to go forward and the next he is running back - at times he is just chasing the ball like a six-year-old in the playground.\nKoeman misses out on history\nHaving collected 1-0 victories in his two previous visits to Old Trafford with Southampton, Dutchman Ronald Koeman was looking to make it a hat-trick by becoming the first manager in Premier League history to win three consecutive away games at Old Trafford.\nThe Everton boss was one minute away from doing so.\nThe Dutchman would have set a record which even Sir Alex Ferguson, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho failed to do in their opening three home games as United manager.\nKoeman's side took the lead as centre-back Jagielka nipped in ahead of the hesitant Marcos Rojo and from there on, the Blues defended deep and resolutely but ultimately came away with just a point.\nEverton's robustness was typified by the assured 20-year-old Mason Holgate, who made four interceptions and regained possession nine times, which was more than any other team-mate.\nThe impressive Ashley Williams patrolled the defence and completed 11 clearances for his team, but it was his late error which led to the equaliser.\nA flash point in the second half saw Kevin Mirallas petulantly refuse a handshake from his manager when substituted on 67 minutes.\nCommenting on the incident, Koeman said: \"I can understand players are a bit disappointed if you sub them but the way he reacted was not a team in my opinion and I will speak with him about that.\"\nMan of the match - Phil Jagielka (Everton)\n'Result is hard to take'\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: \"We scored two legal goals but I tell you with a smile on my face because I am not upset with the linesman. A really difficult decision for him, only video assistant replay could help this.\n\"After pressure, after pressure, after pressure the goal finally arrived and at least you don't have the feeling of defeat.\n\"The players gave everything. The performance from a football point of view was not good but I am very pleased with the effort.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \"It was a difficult game, we controlled it well at 1-0 up, we had chances on the counter in the second half but not always was the last ball a good one.\n\"It was really disappointing you don't get the win. The penalty was the right decision but it was really hard to take.\n\"Manchester United were attacking, taking risks, for that we had to kill the game. I was really confident to keep the clean sheet tonight.\"\nWhat next?\nUnited continue their difficult month with a trip to bottom side Sunderland on Sunday (kick-off 13:30 BST), while Everton host Leicester on the same day (kick-off 16:00 BST).\nNo more second half comebacks - the stats\nManchester United's Premier League unbeaten run now stands at 20 games, but they've drawn half of those (won 10, drawn 10).\nAshley Williams became the first Everton player to be sent off in the Premier League against Manchester United since David Weir in October 2002.\nPhil Jagielka has scored his first Premier League goal since May 2015, 703 days ago against Aston Villa.\nDefender Jagielka is the 17th scorer for Everton this season in the Premier League - they have had more different scorers than any other club.\nThe Red Devils have drawn 12 league games this season, their most in a campaign since the 1998-99 season (13).\nUnited have won just one of the 11 Premier League games they have been trailing at half-time at Old Trafford since Alex Ferguson left the club (drawn three, lost seven).\nUnited have won just six of their 16 league games at home this season (37.5% win percentage), their worst home win % in a campaign since 1973-74 (33.3%)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 3-0 West Ham United\nArsenal boosted their Champions League hopes with a deserved victory over West Ham, who remain in relegation trouble after a fifth consecutive Premier League defeat.\nAfter a quiet first half, Mesut Ozil, on his 150th appearance for the Gunners, fired home from the edge of the box after being gifted possession by Jose Fonte.\nAnd the German, after playing a one-two with Alexis Sanchez, crossed for Theo Walcott - captain for the day in the absence of the injured Laurent Koscielny - to turn home from eight yards out.\nOlivier Giroud curled in a fantastic third after being picked out by fellow substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\nThe Gunners are now up to fifth in the table, only four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, with a game in hand on Pep Guardiola's side.\nWest Ham are five points above the bottom three, although it could have been a lot worse had Swansea not collapsed late on to lose 3-1 to Tottenham.\nRelive the game as it happened here\nArsenal rediscover form at crucial time\nThe Gunners had only won one and drawn another in their past six Premier League games, to leave their hopes of Champions League qualification - having reached the last 17 tournaments - in real jeopardy.\nThere were more protests against long-serving manager Arsene Wenger - with some Gunners fans not taking their seats until the 13th minute. It has been 13 years since they last won the league.\nBut it did not distract the team too much, admittedly against opposition in even worse form than themselves.\nArsenal had the best of the first half, but it was after the break they took control of the game.\nHammers keeper Darren Randolph was unhappy with Ozil's opener as he felt Sanchez was offside and blocking his view, but referee Martin Atkinson did not care for his appeals.\nThe two Gunners stars both linked up to set up Walcott's second, and then Giroud scored the game's outstanding goal to clinch the match. The French striker, who replaced Danny Welbeck, has scored more Premier League goals as a substitute than anyone else this season - five.\nArsenal should have had a penalty in injury time when Sam Byram brought down Nacho Monreal.\nThe Gunners had to play their third-choice keeper, Emiliano Martinez, after injuries to Petr Cech and David Ospina. But the 24-year-old, on his first Premier League appearance since 2014, only had to make two saves in the game.\nWill West Ham ever win again?\nWest Ham have not won a game in more than two months and have Tottenham to thank for them not being dragged closer into the relegation zone.\nBefore Spurs' comeback against Swansea [West Ham's opponents on Saturday], the Hammers looked set to be only three points above the relegation zone. Instead it is five.\nIn the first half, the Hammers were OK, but they collapsed after the Gunners - who are short of confidence themselves - scored their opener.\nThe Hammers' only two shots on target - from Manuel Lanzini and Edimilson Fernandes - came after the game had already gone.\nMichail Antonio, returning from a hamstring injury, only lasted 45 minutes before being replaced at half-time by Robert Snodgrass.\nStriker Diafra Sakho made his first appearance since November after recovering from a back injury, although he only touched the ball eight times after his second-half introduction.\nMan of the match - Mesut Ozil (Arsenal)\nWenger on Ozil: \"I feel that he's back physically with focus.\n\"I know him quite well and I felt that he got hit hard from us going out of the Champions League and it took him some time to recover from that mentally.\n\"I feel for a few weeks now in training he's really focused again - and that comes out in the game.\n\"Of course [he deserves credit]. We live in a world of extremes... we are always praised maybe more than we deserve it and punished more than we deserve it when it doesn't go well - but that's our world.\"\n'Our confidence goes quickly and comes back slowly' - manager reaction\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger told BBC Sport: \"West Ham defended well in the first half and we needed to find a solution in the second half. We were convincing after the break.\n\"Ozil and Sanchez are important players but everyone did well. You could not say any player had a bad performance.\n\"We come out of a difficult period and our confidence goes quickly and comes back slowly.\n\"We are in the final sprint in the Premier League. Consistency will be very important.\n\"We have a little handicap on the points front. We have less possibilities to drop points.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport: \"Arsenal deserved to win. The first half was OK, not only because of the score but we were good. We defended well with numbers. And we were also good on counter-attacks.\n\"In the second half they raised the tempo and scored a goal, and they were the better team. They were sharper than us tonight.\n\"We wanted to keep a clean sheet and the draw as long as possible, or even better to score, and make their fans and players a bit more nervous. But they started to play with more freedom after scoring.\n\"Of course we are [in a relegation battle]. We don't have to hide it. It's not being negative, it's being realistic. I told the players to forget today - we have big games ahead of us. It's a massive game against Swansea on Saturday. We are in a fight to keep our Premier League status. We have to start winning games.\n\"To get that confidence back is the key point. One win will change everything for us. Because three points at this stage of the season are massive.\"\nMatch of the Day analysis\nFormer Arsenal striker Ian Wright: \"I'm just delighted Arsenal got something from the game. Mesut Ozil does what he does. It's his demeanour which upsets people, throwing his hands up in the air. It's unfortunate for him that because of his languid style he gets a lot of stick. As a forward, I'd want him behind me.\n\"I do feel for Slaven Bilic. I have a lot of time for him. The board have said they will back him. I just hope it's not lip service.\"\nArsenal reach century of goals - the stats you need to know\nArsenal became the first Premier League side to score 100 goals in all competitions this season (currently 101).\nTheo Walcott has scored more Premier League goals against West Ham than he has against any other side (six).\nSlaven Bilic's side have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their past 12 away Premier League games.\nArsenal have won both Premier League games against West Ham in a season on 10 occasions - more than they have against any other side.\nNo player has made more errors leading to a goal than Darren Randolph this season (three, level with Simon Francis and John Stones).\nMesut Ozil has scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the second time this season, with the other game being the reverse fixture against the Hammers\nOlivier Giroud has scored more Premier League goals as a substitute than any other player this season (five)\nEmiliano Martinez has kept a clean sheet in three of the four Premier League games he's started for Arsenal.\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham face a match against relegation rivals Swansea on Saturday at 15:00 BST. Arsenal face another London derby - at Crystal Palace - next Monday (20:00)."

The first time they attacked they scored and afterwards we reacted fantastic.\n\"We controlled the game and showed focus in our back line after one bad decision for the second goal.

        "article_text": "Swansea City 1-3 Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham produced a sensational late turnaround to beat a stubborn Swansea side and keep intact their aspirations of winning a first Premier League title.\nDespite dominating possession, Spurs fell behind to a neat close-range finish from their former winger Wayne Routledge.\nThe visitors were camped in their opponents' half for long periods but were frustrated by a combination of their own lack of a cutting edge and Swansea's diligent defending, before Dele Alli eventually broke through to convert Christian Eriksen's cross after 88 minutes.\nSon Heung-min fired Tottenham ahead in added time, and then Eriksen completed the remarkable comeback with a curling effort.\nWhile second-placed Spurs continue to breathe down the necks of leaders Chelsea, a third defeat in four games sees Swansea drop into the relegation zone.\nRe-live Tottenham's dramatic last-gasp win at Swansea\nWednesday's Premier League action\nTottenham leave it late\nHaving cut Chelsea's lead at the top of the table to seven points with Saturday's win at Burnley, Spurs were aiming to further reduce that deficit with a fifth successive Premier League victory.\nYet for all that Mauricio Pochettino's side had impressed this season, that triumph at Turf Moor was only their fifth away league win - and their vulnerability on the road was evident at the Liberty Stadium.\nAlthough they enjoyed near total control of possession and territory during a one-sided first half, Tottenham fell behind after Swansea's first attack of the game.\nJordan Ayew muscled his way into the visitors' penalty area and pulled the ball back to Routledge, one of four former Spurs in the hosts' line-up, and the winger squeezed his finish past ex-Swans keeper Michel Vorm.\nTottenham continued to boss proceedings but lacked a cutting edge in attacking positions, missing injured top scorer Harry Kane and frustrated by their dogged opponents.\nBut as they had demonstrated in their previous seven games without Kane - four wins and three draws - Spurs can cope in the striker's absence.\nThey left it late, with Alli tapping into an empty net from Eriksen's wicked low cross, before Son finished from close range to send the visiting Spurs fans into raptures.\nEriksen then added a third in added time to complete a stunning fightback and leave their opponents crestfallen.\nSwansea's worries deepen\nA return of just one point from their previous three games had seen Swansea sink deeper into relegation trouble, one point and one place above the bottom three.\nHead coach Paul Clement spoke of a nervousness inside the Liberty Stadium during Sunday's goalless draw with Middlesbrough, though any creeping sense of anxiety for the home fans was eased with Routledge's early goal.\nThey made their ground a cauldron of noise, roaring their approval with every tackle, block or pass from a Swansea player.\nThe hosts dared to attack on occasion, with Kyle Naughton close to becoming the second ex-Spurs player to score against his former employers as his deflected shot fizzed wide.\nBut it was Swansea's defensive effort which provided the foundation for their admirable display, and looked set to earn them a first league win over Spurs since 1982.\nHowever, their resistance was eventually broken and, with relegation rivals Hull beating Middlesbrough, the Swans' descent back into the bottom three leaves their hopes of survival in doubt.\nMan of the match - Dele Alli (Tottenham)\nSwansea have never beaten Spurs in the Premier League - the stats you need to know\nTottenham Hotspur (29) have won more points in 2017 than any other Premier League team (W9 D2 L1).\nSpurs have won 17 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season; more than any other side in the competition.\nIn fact, under Mauricio Pochettino Tottenham have won 53 points from losing positions - 13 more than any other Premier League side in that time.\nSwansea have never beaten Tottenham in 12 matches in the Premier League, drawing two and losing 10.\nNo Premier League team has scored more 90th minute winning goals this season than Tottenham (3 - level with Arsenal).\nDele Alli has been involved in 13 goals in 12 Premier League games for Tottenham in 2017 so far (9 goals, 4 assists).\nAlli has yet to lose a Premier League game in which he has scored, winning 16 and drawing five. Christian Eriksen has been directly involved in 10 goals in his seven Premier League games against Swansea (6 goals, 4 assists).\nWayne Routledge made his 182nd Premier League appearance for Swansea City; more than any other player in the competition.\nRoutledge scored his first Premier League goal at the Liberty Stadium since Dec 2014, ending a run of 33 apps there without one.\n'This season we are fighting again' - What they said\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: We are clearly very disappointed to get to 88 minutes leading 1-0 - we had a good chance at 1-0 as well.\n\"We continued to defend well and limit them. The fact we conceded on 88 and then couldn't even draw is heartbreaking.\n\"You still have to do all the things we had done. We were fatigued at the end but the lads gave everything and I am proud of them. We can't feel sorry for ourselves. We have two massive games now at West Ham and Watford.\"\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"We started the game very well and created some chances in the first few minutes. In that moment I think we feel the game is going to be easy. The perception from the touchline was that the players started to play at a low tempo. When we concede the goal we realise we need to push and increase our level.\n\"How the goals arrived at the end was crazy but we pushed, we played better and we created chances to win. It is a good example of the team never giving up and trying to the end. Big credit to the players, they showed big character.\n\"The most important thing is the badge. When you play for Tottenham it is not about the names it is about the team and the spirit. You would like to have all your players available but this season we are showing we are a team.\"\nWhat next?\nSwansea face two big Premier League away games, at West Ham this Saturday, followed a week later by a trip to Watford.\nTottenham are at home against the Hornets this Saturday and then host Bournemouth on the 15th."

        "article_text": "Chelsea 2-1 Manchester City\nChelsea maintained a seven-point advantage over Tottenham at the top of the Premier League with a hard-fought victory over Manchester City.\nPep Guardiola suffered league defeats home and away to the same opponents in a single league season for the first time in his managerial career as City are left to fight for a top-four place.\nEden Hazard gave Chelsea a 10th-minute lead when his shot deflected off returning City captain Vincent Kompany past keeper Willy Caballero, who should have done better.\nChelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois was also badly at fault when his poor clearance to David Silva set up Sergio Aguero's equaliser after 26 minutes - but Chelsea were back in front before half-time.\nThey were awarded a penalty after Fernandinho tripped Pedro and even though Cabellero saved Hazard's spot-kick, the rebound fell kindly for the Belgian to score.\nCity, who stay in fourth, had the better chances in a tense second period, with Kompany's header bouncing back off the bar and John Stones shooting over from six yards in injury time. Chelsea, however, held on for a win that was even more vital given Tottenham's dramatic late comeback at Swansea City.\nChelsea back on track for title\nChelsea's progress towards the Premier League title has been a tale of almost unbroken serenity since manager Antonio Conte reworked his tactical approach after successive losses at home to Liverpool and away to Arsenal in September.\nThis was arguably their biggest game since as it followed on from the shock home loss to Crystal Palace and it was against a Manchester City side with the talent and capability to make this night at Stamford Bridge a real test of nerve.\nAnd so it proved as City, with Silva the orchestrator supreme, putting Chelsea's defence and their supporters on edge right until the final whistle.\nChelsea emerged triumphant thanks to the mixture of talent and resilience that has served them so well this season and the celebrations at the final whistle reflected just what a significant night this might prove to be.\nHazard provided the flourishes but manager Conte proved his pragmatism with the introduction of Nemanja Matic for Kurt Zouma at the start of the second half to attempt to lock down the win.\nIt worked to an extent but Chelsea also enjoyed good fortune as Kompany's header bounced back off the bar and Stones somehow scooped an injury-time chance over the top.\nIn the final reckoning, Chelsea showed the bloody-minded defiance of champions - and this is the sort of result that could earn them that crown.\nConte and Guardiola animated on touchline\nIf this meeting of two of the Premier League's superpowers and two elite coaches was meant to be an enjoyable experience, you would not have known from the body language of Chelsea coach Conte and his Manchester City counterpart Guardiola.\nThe Catalan, in particular, appears to lead an agonised existence in his technical area. The advocate of the joyous, beautiful game looks as if he is going through torture in almost every match.\nHe was slapping his thigh and remonstrating with backroom staff within 15 seconds of the kick-off and he was in regular dialogue with fourth official Bobby Madley, with Conte occasionally joining in.\nIt was, it should be stressed, another frustrating night for Guardiola when his team promised much and ended with nothing - although it concluded with a warm handshake for Conte, who also looked like he had endured a tough night.\nConte, by his standards, was relatively low key but the mask dropped at the final whistle as he pumped his fists in the direction of Chelsea's fans. This was a huge night for the Italian as he did the double over Guardiola.\nCity pay price for familiar failings\nManchester City remain the great enigma of the Premier League - looking like they could score every time they attack but liable to concede at any moment.\nGuardiola still has a goalkeeper conundrum, with Willy Caballero unconvincing and caught out by a routine deflection from Kompany for Hazard's first goal, while there is an air of permanent frailty at the back.\nCity's slim title hopes are now over and they must hunt a top-four place, aided by Bournemouth's late equaliser at Liverpool, and the FA Cup.\nThey must achieve one of both of those targets to stop this season ending unfulfilled before Guardiola tackles those goalkeeping and defensive problems in the summer.\nMan of the match - Eden Hazard\nGood for Hazard, not good for Guardiola - the match stats\nEden Hazard is the first Chelsea player to score home and away against Man City in the Premier League since Salomon Kalou in 2007-08.\nHazard now has 10 Premier League goals at Stamford Bridge this season - more than any other player. This is the second time he's reached double figures at home in the league, after netting 10 there in 2013-14.\nSergio Aguero has scored five goals at Stamford Bridge as an away player in the Premier League - the only player with more is Robin van Persie (six), while Craig Bellamy also has five.\nPep Guardiola has suffered six league defeats as Manchester City boss this season - his highest tally in a single league season as a manager.\nManager reaction\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte told Match of the Day: \"My look is tired because I feel like I played it tonight with my players. I suffered with them.\n\"But we must be pleased because we beat a strong team - the best team in the league. I think they have a great coach - the best in the world. To win this type of game at this time of the season is great.\"\nMan City boss Pep Guardiola told Match of the Day: \"It's an honour to have the amazing players I have. We come here to Stamford Bridge and play the way we have, with huge personality. I'm a lucky guy to manage these guys.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea travel to Bournemouth in Saturday's late kick-off (17:30 BST) while Man City host Hull City at 15:00."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 Watford\nTottenham kept up the pressure on leaders Chelsea with an impressive home victory over Watford, their sixth consecutive Premier League win.\nWatford had started brightly, but Dele Alli's sumptuous strike - curled into the top corner after Son Heung-min's pass - signalled their quick decline.\nWithin just 11 more minutes they were three behind as Eric Dier smashed in from Son's deflected cross, before the South Korea forward added a third just before the break, firing in a rasping drive following Christian Eriksen's pass.\nAfter half-time it was much the same story, with Watford only threatening in isolated moments, and Son further confirmed Spurs' dominance by meeting Kieran Trippier's perfect cross with a lovely half-volley at the far post.\nHarry Kane, returning as a second-half substitute, struck the bar with an injury-time free-kick - the last kick of the game - and Son might have sealed his hat-trick from his earlier pass.\nMauricio Pochettino's side remain seven points adrift of Chelsea, who beat Bournemouth 3-1 later on Saturday.\nBut they are 14 points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who have two games in hand and play at Crystal Palace on Monday (20:00). Spurs have not finished above their north London rivals since 1995.\nRelive Spurs v Watford\nListen: Spurs fan tells 606 'Alli is already world-class'\nHarry who?\nIt was Vincent Janssen who led the line in Kane's absence from the starting line-up - and the Netherlands international missed another easy chance for the game's opening goal.\nTrippier - one of the standout performers, his delivery was brilliant throughout - crossed low from the right flank, taking out goalkeeper and defence, but Janssen could only awkwardly divert the ball onto the bar via the top of his thigh with the goal at his mercy.\nHis only goal in 23 Premier League games, since a \u00a317m summer arrival from AZ Alkmaar, remains a penalty against Leicester in October - and he was once again overshadowed by the dynamic and far more clinical Son.\nSon's second goal was particularly admirable, diverting another superb Trippier ball into the back of the net with a deftly controlled finish.\nBut the pick of the bunch was undoubtedly Alli's. The England midfielder's excellent season continued with a 13th goal from his past 15 league games. You will struggle to see a better one this weekend.\nHornets have an off day\nWatford beat Arsenal 2-1 away in late January, but this performance was a world away.\nThey might claim mitigating circumstances - it was something of a makeshift defence with Miguel Britos suspended and Younes Kaboul and Sebastian Prodl both injured - but once their positive start had faded, Spurs picked them off with ease.\nWalter Mazzarri's side had moved up to 10th in the league with two wins in a row, easing pressure on their manager, but the Italian will still be concerned by the possibility of a slide down the table in their remaining seven games.\nMazzarri has said he wants to stay, but the fate of Quique Sanchez Flores, who was fired at the end of last season with the club in 13th, will surely be at the forefront of his mind.\nThe race for the title\nTottenham, whose last league title came in 1961, need Chelsea to drop points if they are to overtake the Blues at the top of the league.\nBut even if they do not, a second-placed finish - which would be their highest in the Premier League - is looking likely.\nAlli tops Lampard, Gerrard and Beckham - the stats\nTottenham have won 11 Premier League home games in a row, their best winning streak at White Hart Lane since 1987 (14)\nWatford have won just once in their past 11 away league games (D2 L8)\nDele Alli has been directly involved in 14 goals in 13 Premier League games for Tottenham in 2017 (10 goals, 4 assists)\nAlli (40) has had a hand in as many Premier League goals before turning 21 as Frank Lampard (15), Steven Gerrard (13) & David Beckham (12) combined\nSon Heung-min has had a hand in five goals in his last three Premier League games (4 goals, 1 assist), after none in the five before that\nMan of the match - Son Heung-min\nEx-Wales striker John Hartson on BBC Radio 5 live:\n\"I would use the word sensational for Son. Every time he had the ball, other than his miss from that Harry Kane pass, he's been really, really good. A top class player and he got a big bear hug from his manager.\"\nWhat they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"Many things impressed me, we played really well. It is a massive result for us. We will keep pushing and keep believing.\n\"The team deserve full credit because the energy was fantastic. It was 4-0 but we deserved more goals. The players spoke for me on the pitch and I am very proud of that performance.\n\"We're second and the gap now is four but Chelsea have one game more to play. We will try to be there if Chelsea fail.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"We started really well and were playing at the same level as Tottenham, who are a phenomenal side. But it was really difficult after the three goals, that cut our legs.\n\"We had players who were tired from playing many games, it was a pity. But taking everything into consideration we are happy, and we have to look forward.\n\"We now have seven finals to play, and we are looking forward to building on this next year.\"\nWhat's next?\nTottenham play Bournemouth at home in the Premier League next Saturday, when Watford host relegation-threatened Swansea City."

        "article_text": "West Ham United 1-0 Swansea City\nWest Ham ended a five-game losing run as they gained a much-needed win over struggling Swansea City.\nThe Hammers took a deserved lead just before half-time when Cheikhou Kouyate collected a Robert Snodgrass pass and scored with a stunning low 25-yard strike.\nSwansea substitute Luciano Narsingh came closest to an equaliser for the visitors but his powerful strike went just over.\nThe result leaves Swansea in the bottom three of the Premier League with only six games left to secure their top-flight survival.\nFor West Ham though, they move up to 14th and now have an eight-point cushion between themselves and 18th-placed Swansea.\nRelive West Ham versus Swansea as it happened\nAnalysis and reaction from today's Premier League games\nNot pretty, but three vital points\nThe pre-game stats made unpleasant reading for West Ham, as they had lost five Premier League games in a row, gone seven games without a win and had won only once in nine to be dragged into a relegation battle.\nManager Slaven Bilic had called for his side to stay together and was rewarded with a battling performance and a solid defensive effort that nullified a lacklustre Swansea side.\nKouyate's strike was a rare moment of quality in the game and came after captain Mark Noble, making his 400th appearance for the club, played forward to Snodgrass, who set up the Senegal midfielder.\nAs the Swans defence backed off, Kouyate was given the space to drill home a beautiful strike, the lead deserved after Swans goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had earlier denied Michail Antonio, Andre Ayew and Robert Snodgrass.\nWith West Ham defending well, especially through last-ditch blocks from James Collins and Sam Byram, the Hammers held on for a win, which Noble described as \"their biggest for a number of years\".\nThe only negative for the Hammers was a hamstring injury to Antonio, who had looked lively leading the line before he pulled up as he sprinted down the left wing during the first half.\nUnder-par Swansea disappoint\nWhile West Ham move up to 36 points, Swansea, on 28 points, face a huge fight on their hands if they are going to extend their six-year run of top-flight football for another year.\nThe Swans, who conceded three late goals in a 3-1 home defeat against Tottenham on Wednesday, will need to play much better than they did at the London Stadium, where there only had one effort on target.\nWith the normally effective Gylfi Sigurdsson having a quiet match, the Swans best work came from Jordan Ayew but he could not do enough to force his side level.\nSecond-half substitute Fernando Llorente, the club's top goalscorer this season, had missed two games because of an ankle injury but was off the pace and did not look like scoring.\nManager Paul Clement could also be without Jack Cork for a while. The midfielder limped off with an ankle injury after he landed badly in challenging for a header.\nMan of the match - Lukasz Fabianski (Swansea)\nSwansea's woeful away run - the stats\nSwansea have lost five consecutive Premier League away games for the first time ever.\nWest Ham registered a win for the first time in their last eight top-flight games (drew two, lost five).\nSwansea are without a clean sheet in each of their last 15 Premier League away games, the longest current such run in the top-flight.\nCheikhou Kouyate scored his first Premier League goals in 30 games, last netting against West Brom on 30 May 2016.\nRobert Snodgrass registered his first goal involvement in his 10th Premier League game for West Ham, having scored three and assisted two in the 10 before that for Hull.\nThe Swans directed only one shot on target in the game; only once this season in the Premier League have they managed fewer (0 v Tottenham on 3 December).\nThe Hammers kept a clean sheet for the first time in their last 11 top-flight games.\n'A very poor result' - what they said\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic speaking to BBC Sport: \"It is a huge win and I congratulate the boys. The spirit, team-work. We were solid and dangerous. We deserved to win.\n\"It was much-needed. There was big pressure, not on me, but the players. The crowd recognised that and were behind us.\n\"It was a great goal. We started well and after half an hour they slowed us down. We had chances before the goal, but in every game you need a spark of extra quality.\n\"It's my job, but there's a bigger picture about the club. We are the ones to blame for being in this position. I was celebrating for the players, because they have been with me and they deserve it. Now we need four more points as soon as possible.\n\"We were out of the relegation battle six games ago and we are out of it again. We don't want to be in it again.\"\nWest Ham captain Mark Noble: \"That's our biggest win in a few years. The run we've had, we haven't been good enough but we haven't had the rub of the green either.\n\"I thought we played well under pressure. Swansea were only a few points behind us. It was so important and it's a fantastic win for the club.\n\"One more win should see us safe. This should release the pressure, the lads should be happier. We haven't been good enough for a couple of months, but this should release the pressure.\n\"It was not pretty but the only thing that matters was the three points. There's no point in us playing like Real Madrid and losing 2-0.\"\nSwansea manager Paul Clement speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's a very poor result for us. We didn't deserve anything more than what we got. In the first half we were full of anxiety and fear. It affected out ability to do the basics.\n\"We made changes in the second half to be more positive, but we lost our identity and shape. It was a scrappy, poor game of football. Both teams are struggling. It's a big result for them and they won't care about how they performed. It's not a good afternoon for us.\n\"In the second half we gave it more. We were less anxious, but in terms of shape and technical quality, we were not at the level required.\n\"We got the ball up there a little bit more after Fernando Llorente came on. We had a couple of half-chances, but we didn't create enough clear-cut chances.\n\"The only positive we can take is that not much has changed around us. Hull lost at Manchester City. It's still tight with a lot of football to be played.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides are next in Premier League action on Saturday, 15 April. Swansea play at Watford, while West Ham are away at Sunderland (both 15:00 BST). The Hammers will be without club captain Noble as he will be suspended for two matches after he picked up his 10th booking of the season for a foul on Leroy Fer."

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-1 Hull City\nManchester City ended a four-game winless run in the Premier League with a comfortable victory over Hull City on Saturday that boosted their hopes of finishing in a Champions League spot.\nAhmed Elmohamady's own goal opened the scoring before half time at Etihad Stadium, as the Hull defender turned in Jesus Navas' dangerous low cross.\nRaheem Sterling's jinking run then set up Sergio Aguero and the Argentine's powerful effort squeezed past Eldin Jakupovic.\nThe Hull goalkeeper had no chance from City's third, with Fabian Delph allowed time and space to lash in from outside the box.\nAndrea Ranocchia did pull one back late on, as Claudio Bravo let a weak effort trickle past him.\nRelive the action from Etihad Stadium\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nCity's tough run comes to an end\nPep Guardiola's side went into this one having not tasted victory in the league since a trip to Sunderland on 5 March.\nWith that four-game winless run seeing them drop points against top-five opposition in Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool, the Spaniard wrote off their chances of competing for the title.\nAnd with Champions League qualification now his focus, Guardiola would have been a relieved man when Elmohamady turned the ball into his own net after some resolute defending from Hull in the first half hour.\nThey could and should have added to their tally with both David Silva and Leroy Sane being denied by Jakupovic, while Yaya Toure and Delph again went close.\nThe hosts were always in control, enjoying 67% of the possession, but at times they looked fragile at the back and only an Oumar Niasse mis-kick stopped the visitors from levelling almost immediately after the opener.\nSilva hits 300\nIt was a landmark occasion for David Silva, as the 31-year-old celebrated his 300th game for Manchester City by taking the captain's armband.\nThe Spaniard's incisive passing and superb vision regularly found Sane and Sterling - who set up Aguero for the second - in space on either flank, but it was a composed performance from all of City's playmakers.\nToure made more than 100 passes - 64 of those in the Hull half - while both he and midfield partner Delph boasted passing accuracies in excess of 92%.\nDelph's goal added to his all-round performance, with his the pick of City's strikes as he rifled home a low shot at the end of a flowing move.\nBut, at the other end, a Premier League recall for Bravo for the first time since 21 January seemed to do nothing to inspire the hosts' defence.\nThe one shot the goalkeeper had to save squirmed past him, adding fuel to the Chilean's critics.\nHull's own Silva lining\nHull were bottom when Marco Silva took over in January, but the Portuguese has guided the Tigers out of the drop zone with five wins since his arrival.\nHowever, their recent resurgence has been built on some impressive home form having only picked up one point in six league matches on the road now under their new boss.\nThat was apparent with the approach the Portuguese took at the Etihad, where he looked for his side to contain City and hit them on the break.\nDespite the comprehensive defeat there were positives for the 39-year-old, who threw on attacking reinforcements late on and was rewarded when Shaun Maloney set up Ranocchia for a consolation.\nThe Tigers remain two points above the relegation zone after Swansea lost at West Ham.\nMan of the match - Fabian Delph (Man City)\nTop-four fight 'will go to the last day'\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"It was important for us to win after many days without a win. We started well and created chances and we had the right attitude.\n\"We could have scored many more goals. It is frustrating not to get a clean sheet but we defended poorly at set-pieces.\n\"It will definitely go to the last day [the fight for top four].\"\nHull boss Marco Silva: \"The second goal was the key but they deserved to win the game.\n\"We reacted well after the first goal and had a chance to score but they scored after half time and that was key.\n\"It is in our hands, we have six games to go and we will work hard. Since I came here I was confident and I have passed that on to our players.\"\nStats - Delph breaks 448-day duck\nNo Premier League side has scored more goals in all competitions than Manchester City this season (101, level with Arsenal).\nHowever, only Hull (1) have kept fewer home clean sheets in the Premier League this season than Man City (3).\nSergio Aguero has scored 10 goals in his last 10 games for Man City in all competitions.\nFabian Delph scored his first Premier League goal in 448 days, since netting against Crystal Palace in January 2016.\nPep Guardiola's side have benefited from a league-high five own goals this season, including one in both games against the Tigers.\nWhat next?\nManchester City head to Southampton next Saturday (17:30 BST) in the Premier League, before a trip to Wembley to face Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final.\nHull are on the road again next weekend when they visit Stoke City in the league (15:00)."

They had 18 attempts in the 2-0 midweek defeat by Watford and Pulis is disappointed his side are not taking their chances.\n\"We have had 35 shots over the last two games, we need to have more composure and steadiness in front of goal,\" Pulis told BBC Sport.\nStill, barring a dramatic collapse, they should be able to achieve the Chinese owners' target of a top-10 finish this season.\nForster saves the day\nPerformances like today will put Forster back in contention to challenge Joe Hart for the England jersey.\nThe 29-year-old made six saves today and manager Claude Puel paid tribute. saying: \"Fraser was the difference at the end, he preserved the three points.\"\nIt was his two injury-time saves that really caught the eye.\nIn the 93rd minute Jake Livermore played the ball over the top and Dawson managed to connect with a volley that Forster saved at point-blank range.\nTwo minutes later, Chris Brunt's corner was flicked on by Livermore and Evans' side-footed shot was slapped away by the former Newcastle keeper.\nBefore those heroics it had been Tadic who had starred for Saints. Since making his Premier League debut in August 2014, following his \u00a310.9m move from FC Twente, he has provided 24 assists.\nOnly Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas (32), Arsenal's Mesut Ozil (30) and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (26) have more.\nSouthampton have now lost just one of their last six league games, after losing six and winning just one of the seven before that.\nMan of the match - Fraser Forster\nWhat they said - 'Fraser was the difference'\nPuel told BBC Sport: \"It was an excellent performance. We played a good first-half and could have scored another goal. It was a perfect second half, you can see the character of the players and the team.\n\"To get a clean sheet here is good with the quality of West Brom and the quality of their set-pieces. After the win against Crystal Palace, it's another good performance in terms of consistency.\n\"Fraser was the difference at the end, he preserved the three points.\"\nPulis told BBC Sport: \"We created better opportunities in the second half and as the game went on we controlled the last 25 minutes and I felt we did enough to get something out of the game.\n\"It is disappointing considering the chances were there, especially in the second half. We have had 35 shots over the last two games. We need to have more composure and steadiness in front of goal. But I can't fault my players today, over the last 25 minutes they showed their mettle and kept going.\"\nWhat next?\nSouthampton welcome Manchester City to Saint Mary's on Saturday, while West Brom host Liverpool on Sunday."

        "article_text": "Middlesbrough 0-0 Burnley\nMiddlesbrough wasted a golden opportunity to boost their survival hopes as they were held to a goalless draw by Burnley at the Riverside Stadium.\nBoro are six points shy of safety and it appears the writing is on the wall with their remaining seven fixtures including games against Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea.\nIt was at times a turgid spectacle played at a slow tempo, which was a surprise considering what was at stake for the Teesside club.\nTheir best chances came in the second half. First, substitute Alvaro Negredo produced a wonderful overhead kick that keeper Tom Heaton did well to push away. Burnley defender Matt Lowton then made successive goalline clearances in the closing minutes - first to deny Stewart Downing and then Daniel Ayala.\nThe Clarets - yet to win on their league travels this season - barely threatened the Boro goal, although they did hit the crossbar through Robbie Brady's free-kick.\nThe point moves the visitors eight points clear of the Premier League drop zone.\nRelive the action from the Riverside Stadium\nReaction from Saturday's other Premier League games\nAll over for Middlesbrough?\nProbably.\nThis was the match many thought would see Boro end their run of 14 league games without a win - but not until the last five minutes did that look a possibility.\nTheir former goalscoring hero Bernie Slaven feared the worst on BBC's Football Focus earlier, when he suggested his old team had not shown urgency in recent months.\nThat urgency did rear its head, though only in the closing stages after coach Steve Agnew finally decided to twist by bringing on attackers Negredo and Adama Traore.\nSoon after his introduction, Negredo almost became a \"super sub\" when his brilliant overhead kick was palmed away by the alert Heaton.\nThey were then twice denied by brilliant defending from Lowton. The 27-year-old defensive player valiantly cleared Downing's goalbound free-kick before hacking Ayala's header off the line.\nWith a tough run-in coming up, it looks like Boro's days are numbered.\nLowton and Ward shine for the Clarets\nYes, Burnley have not won on the road in the league, but the display against Middlesbrough must have felt like a win.\nThey denied Boro space right from the kick-off and when they were tested in the final minutes Sean Dyche's men were up to the task.\nHis general that deserves a medal is Lowton, who made two vital clearances. And at the other end, Stephen Ward was exceptional down the wing in a game where the Clarets attack underwhelmed.\nThey were perhaps lucky not to play the last nine minutes with 10 men after Michael Keane appeared to bring down Patrick Bamford, who would have been through on goal. Referee Martin Atkinson only showed a yellow card.\nThe Clarets have three more matches at home - where they have picked up most of their points this season. They could secure their safety with victory over Manchester United at Turf Moor on 23 April.\nMan of the match - Matt Lowton\n'We are disappointed not to have won'\nMiddlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: \"We had the chances came in the second half.\n\"Alvaro [Negredo] had the over-head kick and there was Stewy Downing's free-kick that was going in but cleared off the line.\n\"I thought the lads were terrific in terms of their effort and commitment, and I thought we deserved to win the game.\n\"You have to give Stewy credit, he stood up and did everything he could've done. That's the quality that he and the rest of the players have. It was a game that we're disappointed to not have won.\"\nOn the challenge on Bamford:\n\"It was a disappointing decision. The defender was on the wrong side. Patrick was in control of the ball and would have had a shot on goal.\"\nOn their survival hopes:\n\"It leaves us six points short of where we need to be with a game in hand.\"\nBoro only English team without 2017 win - the stats\nMiddlesbrough have been involved in seven goalless draws in the Premier League this season, at least three more than any other side.\nIndeed, the Riverside Stadium has seen fewer goals than any other Premier League ground this season (29 - 12 scored, 17 conceded).\nDyche's side remain one of just two sides in the top four tiers of English football without an away league win this season (also Rotherham).\nBoro are the only side in English league football without a win in 2017, last earning three points against Swansea on 17 December.\nThe past seven league meetings between these sides have produced just six goals in total.\nOf the 10 previous occasions a team has scored 22 goals or fewer after 31 Premier League games, only two have avoided relegation (Crystal Palace in 2013-14 and Aston Villa in 2014-15 - both scored 20 goals).\nWhat's next?\nMiddlesbrough are at home to fifth-place Arsenal on Monday, 17 April (20:00 BST). Burnley are away at Everton next Saturday (15:00)."

I was happy, we were good value at 1-0 and restricted them to very little.\n\"Second half they brought their big hitters on, which made an impact, but it took a mistake from us.\n\"It was a long ball down the middle and we should have dealt with it. When those are the things that are happening you think maybe it's not your day.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"Philippe Coutinho lost three kilos in the past three days, which some people wish - but for a professional footballer it's not too cool.\n\"Simon Mignolet saved our life. Job done, feels good. Nice weather, 63 points and I couldn't feel any better.\n\"Now we have a long week. No team in the world wins only the very, very good games. You need to win games like this.\"\n'Comeback kings' - the stats\nLiverpool have won more points from losing positions than any other Premier League team this season (18).\nThere were just 126 seconds between Liverpool's first and second goals.\nWalters has scored seven times against Liverpool in the Premier League, more than he has against any other side.\nWijnaldum has provided six Premier League assists this season, one more than he registered for Newcastle in 2015-16.\nKlopp's side won their first away Premier League game of 2017.\nWhat's next?\nStoke can end a four-match losing run at home to Hull City on Saturday, 15 April (15:00 BST), while Liverpool are away at West Brom the following day (13:30)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 1-3 Chelsea\nChelsea maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League with an entertaining victory over spirited Bournemouth.\nPressured by Tottenham's earlier thrashing of Watford, the visitors looked to be cruising after two goals in three first-half minutes.\nBut Bournemouth, who had already hit the post, got back into the contest through Joshua King's long-range deflected effort.\nThe Cherries continued to press after half-time, only for Chelsea to gradually regain control and secure the points through Marcos Alonso's impeccable free-kick.\nThe Blues next travel to Manchester United, their sternest of seven league fixtures between now and the end of the season.\nIf they return from Old Trafford with their seven-point advantage still intact, they will be a huge step closer to a sixth title and fifth in the Premier League era.\nRelive Chelsea's win over Bournemouth\nChelsea keep Spurs at bay\nA week ago, Chelsea's seemingly unstoppable march to glory was disrupted by a shock home defeat by Crystal Palace, giving hope to second-placed Tottenham.\nHowever, they got back on track by beating Manchester City and seemed unaffected by Spurs' earlier victory in producing an emphatic start in the south-coast sun.\nIf the Chelsea first goal was bizarre - Diego Costa's scuffed shot went in off the head of grounded home defender Adam Smith - the second was sublime.\nN'Golo Kante, excellent in both winning the ball and moving the visitors forward, found the equally impressive Eden Hazard with a precision long pass, allowing the galloping Belgian to round home keeper Artur Boruc.\nThe away side were pegged back either side of half-time, but gradually reasserted themselves as the second period progressed and Alonso's curling, dipping free-kick killed the contest.\nBournemouth battle again\nAt the beginning of March, Bournemouth were winless in eight league games, only five points above the relegation zone and being dragged into a fight for survival.\nHowever, some whole-hearted displays, including coming from behind to earn a point at Liverpool in midweek, meant this was their first defeat in six.\nIt could have been different with a change of fortune, too.\nThere was a huge slice of luck involved in Chelsea's first and Benik Afobe was unfortunate to hit the woodwork when arriving late to meet Charlie Daniels' cross.\nWith Afobe, King and Ryan Fraser all lively, the Cherries were willing to test Chelsea through the middle and got their reward when King lashed in his 13th of the season from outside the box, via a touch off David Luiz - even if Chelsea complained of a Smith handball in the build-up.\nUltimately, though, coming from two behind was too much to ask for the home side and it was Boruc who was the much busier keeper in the second period.\nCosta concern?\nIf there is one, incredibly slight, concern for Chelsea in the run-in, it may be the form of Costa, who has now gone five domestic games without a goal.\nThe Spain international's afternoon was one of frustration, mis-kicks and miscues, albeit plenty of endeavour to create goalscoring opportunities.\nHis attempt for Chelsea's first was a comical slice, only saved from going well wide by the intervention of Smith.\nBut that was not the only time that Costa struggled in front of goal, with the man who has netted 18 times this season often lacking sharpness when presented with an opportunity.\nStill, that is no comfort for the chasing pack, who probably already have too much to do.\n'Chelsea were too strong' - what they said\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"I thought it was a tight game and we were well in it. It doesn't help going 2-0 down and it took a worldie free-kick to win the game.\n\"I have to compliment Chelsea, they're an outstanding team and their system works very well for them. But I compliment my boys as well because they played very well. In the end Chelsea were too strong.\n\"I'm not feeling anything other than we need to win some more games. What we've historically done is always try to win and that's the same aim no matter how many points you have and how many games are left.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte: \"It's normal to have a pressure. We started the game very well with great attention and focus. Then we conceded the goal and we lost a bit of confidence. In the second half we managed the game and scored another goal, then the free-kick from Marcos Alonso.\n\"When you have this type of opponent, Tottenham, who is in good form and wants to catch you, it is important to have a good answer. This is a good answer. There are seven games to go and in England it is not easy, there is a lot of pressure.\"\nGarden of Eden - the stats\nEden Hazard has scored four times in his last three Premier League appearances against Bournemouth.\nHazard's haul of 14 Premier League goals this season is his joint-best-ever return in a season in the competition (also 14 in 13-14 and 14-15).\nN'Golo Kante has provided his first ever Premier League assist for Chelsea in what is his 30th appearance.\nJoshua King has scored 10 goals in his last 11 Premier League appearances, after netting just three in the 20 before that this season.\nIndeed, only Romelu Lukaku (11) and Harry Kane (11) have scored more Premier League goals in 2017 than Josh King (10 - level with Dele Alli).\nMarcos Alonso has netted five PL goals this season. Among defenders, only James Milner (7) and Gareth McAuley (6) have more.\nWhat's next?\nBournemouth complete a back-to-back double of the Premier League's top two with a trip to Tottenham Hotspur at 12:30 next Saturday, while Chelsea are reunited with former manager Jose Mourinho against Manchester United at 16:00 on Sunday, 16 April."

        "article_text": "Sunderland 0-3 Manchester United\nBottom club Sunderland's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered another setback as Manchester United eased to victory to climb to fifth in the table.\nSunderland played with 10 men for more than 45 minutes after Sebastian Larsson's controversial red card for a challenge on Ander Herrera.\nZlatan Ibrahimovic had already put United ahead with a sublime, curling 20-yard effort.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan made it 2-0 before Marcus Rashford drilled in the third.\nSunderland are 10 points from safety with just seven games left and have not scored for seven matches.\nUnited, who move above Arsenal, are four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with one game in hand over their neighbours.\nAnalysis: Why Moyes needs to change Sunderland's mood\nReaction from the Stadium of Light\nSunderland two weeks from relegation?\nThis was Sunderland's 21st league defeat in 31 games this season, while they have now gone 11 hours and 15 minutes without scoring in the top flight.\nIt is hard to see where another win is going to come from and the Black Cats' relegation to the Championship could be confirmed as soon as 26 April - with five games remaining.\nSunderland were not helped by an injury to Bryan Oviedo, which cut short the defender's afternoon, while Larsson's contentious straight red card for going over the top of the ball on Herrera ended any realistic chance of a win before the interval.\nLarsson, who was furious with referee Craig Pawson's decision, now faces a suspension for his first Premier League dismissal in what was his 278th appearance in the competition.\nMoments before the red card, Victor Anichebe had been denied by United's Argentina keeper Sergio Romero, who was starting in place of the injured David de Gea.\nJermain Defoe went close from 20 yards after the interval but the Black Cats have lost six of their last seven games and look drained of any confidence.\nShaw earns a pat from Mourinho\nJose Mourinho made five changes for his side's 50th competitive game of the season but while keeper De Gea's absence was down to injury, the United boss opted to rotate players ahead of Thursday's Europa League quarter-final first leg with Anderlecht.\nLuke Shaw made a surprise return just days after Mourinho had questioned the full-back's commitment and delivered a polished performance as the Red Devils stretched their unbeaten Premier League run to 21 games.\nShaw recovered from an early booking, awarded for flying in behind on Didier Ndong, to offer width and attacking threat down the left.\nIn front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate, he set up a great chance for Marouane Fellaini, made captain for the day four months after being booed by his own fans.\nAnd Shaw's lively contribution also included an attempt on goal and the pass to Mkhitaryan to make it 2-0.\nIt was telling when Mourinho gave the 21-year-old a deserved pat on the back when he was replaced, with United in total control, soon after Ndong accidentally stood on his ankle.\nIbrahimovic's opening goal was a delight, spinning away from Billy Jones before bending home from outside the area.\nNo Sunderland player had touched the ball when Mkhitaryan doubled the lead 45 seconds into the second half with a low shot, while substitute Rashford completed a fine counter-attack to slot his first league goal since 24 September.\nOnly days earlier, Mourinho said Rashford was suffering from a major lack of confidence caused by his lack of goals.\nMan of the match - Luke Shaw (Manchester United)\nSunderland boss David Moyes: \"I don't want to blame referees for my position and us losing. Today the result was helped by the referee. Manchester United were playing well but the red card was a decision that went against us.\n\"[Before United scored] We were hanging in the game and staying in the game and trying to do our best. We gave away a poor goal and I thought we needed to get a lot closer. When we went down to 10 men it made it a lot harder.\n\"We keep going. We have another home game next Saturday and we have to try and win it. We do some good things but just lack a bit of quality but it's not for the want of trying. The boys are doing everything they can.\n\"The hardest thing as a manager is losing and we're losing a lot. The players care and want to do well and we're not doing as well as we should be.\"\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"We want to fight in the Premier League until it is mathematically impossible. The Premier League we cannot win, but Europa League we can.\n\"We had lots of players that were not here today and the most important thing after the three points was to have no more injuries.\n\"I took Shaw off because of the yellow card and the pressure from the crowd. It was good to protect him but was also good for him to play one hour with a good solid performance and no mistakes, so I'm really pleased for him.\"\n'Joint-second worst run in Premier League history' - the stats\nSunderland have now failed to score in seven successive Premier League games - the joint-second worst run in Premier League history. Crystal Palace hold the record with nine games (1994-95), with Derby (2007-08) and Ipswich (1994-95) also going seven games without scoring.\nThe Black Cats' run without scoring in the Premier League now stands at 675 minutes. In that time they have attempted 79 shots in total without netting any of them.\nZlatan Ibrahimovic scored in his 21st different match of the season for Manchester United.\nIbrahimovic has now scored 10 away goals in the Premier League this season - only Sergio Aguero (11) and Alexis Sanchez (12) have more on the road.\nSunderland have averaged a red card every 887 minutes in Premier League history - only three teams have a worse ratio than this: Hull (720 mins), Blackburn (824 mins) and Barnsley (855).\nWhat's next?\nSunderland host West Ham United in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 BST) by which time Manchester United will have played Thursday's Europa League quarter-final first leg against Anderlecht in Belgium (20:05 BST)."

        "article_text": "Everton 4-2 Leicester City\nEverton registered their seventh straight home league win as Romelu Lukaku scored twice to check Leicester's renaissance under boss Craig Shakespeare.\nTom Davies poked in for the hosts after 30 seconds, before Leicester rallied with a slick counter-attacking goal from Islam Slimani and a superb free-kick from Marc Albrighton.\nBut Leicester, much changed before Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final at Atletico Madrid, never looked comfortable.\nLukaku headed in a Ross Barkley cross to draw Everton level and Phil Jagielka was allowed too much space at a corner as the Toffees reached the break ahead.\nLukaku drilled in from close range after the interval and the withdrawal of the bright Demarai Gray and striker Jamie Vardy seemed to signal Leicester's attentions turning towards Europe.\nListen: 'In my opinion he's the best' - 5 live Football Daily\nRelive Everton's win over Leicester\nOnwards and upwards for Lukaku\nWith his 22nd and 23rd Premier League goals putting him four clear of Harry Kane in the top-flight scoring charts, Lukaku will soon have to search further afield for his scoring benchmarks.\nHis game-sealing second - a sharp finish after cleverly lurking in the shadow of Jagielka at a corner - means that only five other men have scored more in Europe's top four leagues.\nThe last time that Everton had such a prolific goalscorer was Gary Lineker in the 1985-86 season. Lineker left at the end of that campaign for Barcelona and, after Lukaku turned down a \u00a3140,000-a-week contract extension last month, it seems European football is the minimum required to keep him at the club.\nVictory moves Everton level with sixth-placed Arsenal, below them on goal difference, albeit having played three games more.\nSeventh should be good enough for a Europa League place, however, with Manchester United winning the League Cup and the FA Cup semi-finals being contested by teams above them in the table.\nOpen-season first half\nOne goal in 30 seconds, three inside 10 minutes and five before the half was out. An extraordinary first 45 minutes was more a product of flimsy defending rather than incisive attacking, however.\nLeicester have kept clean sheets in their last two games with Yohan Benalouane filling in for Wes Morgan at the centre of defence, but the Tunisian looked out of his depth from the first minute at Goodison Park.\nAs Kevin Mirallas drove towards the penalty area in the match's first attack he rashly sold himself to spread panic through the visitors backline and allow Davies space to score the joint fastest Premier League goal of the season.\nAt the other end Everton seemed to miss the suspended Ashley Williams' authority and organisation as Gray burst forward on a swift counter to slip in Slimani but it was Benalouane's presence, rather than the Wales international's absence, that was to prove the more telling feature of the match.\nFirst the Leicester centre-back allowed Lukaku to stroll in front of him to restore parity in the 23rd minute and then lost contact with Jagielka as the captain sent his side to the dressing room ahead at the end of a breathless first half.\nMadrid on the mind for Foxes\nVictory for Leicester at Goodison Park would have extended their winning streak in the league to six matches - more than they achieved at any point in last season's title-winning campaign.\nHowever, their title defence, fatally undermined by their form under Shakespeare's predecessor Claudio Ranieri, has now been eclipsed by their run to the last eight of the Champions League.\nThe return of the rested Wilfred Ndidi in midfield should add much-needed steel to the side for a testing evening in the Vicente Calderon as they aim for silverware that would arguably surpass even last season's Premier League coup.\nMan of the Match - Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\nWhat the managers said\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"Romelu Lukaku is one of the best strikers in the world and I think the boy is improving in different aspects.\n\"Everybody knows he's a key player for Everton and we will try to do everything to keep him here but the final decision is always with the player. Everyone knows he has his own ambition but we will try our best.\n\"After we got to 4-2 we really controlled the game and it's one of the most complete performances of the season.\"\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare: \"We've got a big run of games coming up. I need to use the squad. The team that was picked was good enough to come here and get the result.\n\"We've said before we don't dwell on results. We can't do because we're training tomorrow for a big game on Wednesday.\n\"We have to move on quickly and we will learn from it. You're always a bit disappointed but we will brush ourselves down and we will be ready for Wednesday.\"\nLukaku out-scores Middlesborough - the stats\nEverton have now won seven successive Premier League home games - equalling their Premier League club record.\nEverton have already scored more Premier League goals at Goodison Park in 2017 (26 in seven games) than they did in the whole of 2016 (25 in 18 games).\nRomelu Lukaku has scored in seven successive Premier League matches at Goodison Park (12 goals) and has scored in all eight appearances there in 2017 overall (seven in league, one in FA Cup).\nLukaku's run is the best in Everton's Premier League history at home, beating Duncan Ferguson and Francis Jeffers's runs of scoring in six successive appearances at Goodison Park.\nLukaku now has 23 Premier League goals this season; one more than Middlesbrough have as a team (22).\nThis was the first Premier League game to see three goals scored by the 10th minute of the match since Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal in February 2011, when Newcastle came from 0-4 behind.\nThis was only the third Premier League match this season to see five goals scored in the first half, following Hull v Middlesbrough on 5 April and Crystal Palace v Liverpool on 29 October.\nPhil Jagielka has scored two Premier League goals over the space of six days - his previous two Premier League goals came over a period of 897 days.\nWhat's next?\nEverton will look to extend their winning streak at Goodison Park to eight matches when they take on Burnley on Saturday at 15:00 BST. Leicester take on last season's runner-ups Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday at 19:45 BST."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 3-0 Arsenal\nCrystal Palace continued their recent revival to boost their Premier League survival hopes and leave Arsenal struggling to maintain their run of top-four finishes under Arsene Wenger.\nPalace led through Andros Townsend's close-range finish, doubling their lead when Yohan Cabaye's shot looped in.\nLuka Milivojevic clinched victory with a firm, low penalty as Palace moved six points clear of the relegation zone.\nSixth-placed Arsenal did not manage a shot on target in a poor second half.\nSome travelling Gunners fans again called for manager Wenger, who has led Arsenal to top-four finishes in each of his previous 20 seasons at the helm, to leave the club.\nThe Frenchman's side are seven points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City with eight games remaining.\nFollow all the post-match reaction from Selhurst Park\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nFeeble Arsenal put more heat on Wenger\nThe manner of Arsenal's performance - disorganised, devoid of attacking ideas and lacking fight - will increase the scrutiny on Wenger yet again.\nThe 67-year-old has already faced protests from some supporters urging him to leave, with more calls clearly audible - along with the barracking of his players in the latter stages - at Selhurst Park.\nWenger's contract expires at the end of the season and the club has offered him a new two-year deal, although he is still to announce whether he intends to carry on.\nArsenal had 72% possession against Palace but that mattered for little as the hosts broke quickly on the counter-attack, exploiting space down the flanks and taking their chances clinically.\nThe Gunners looked defensively vulnerable whenever Palace went forward, lacking leadership without injured captain Laurent Koscielny.\nAnd when the visitors did attack, Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey was only required to make saves from Mohamed Elneny and Alexis Sanchez.\nAfter the break, Hennessey did not even face a shot on target as Arsenal suffered a fourth straight away defeat for the first time under Wenger.\n\"Palace wanted it more. You could sense that from the kick-off,\" Theo Walcott, Arsenal's stand-in captain, said.\nBig Sam to avoid relegation again?\nWhile Wenger has never led Arsenal to a finish outside the top four, opposite number Sam Allardyce has a proud record of not being relegated from the top flight.\nOn this evidence, Allardyce looks much likelier to maintain his achievement than his long-time adversary.\nThe former England manager, who has previously kept up Bolton, Blackburn and Sunderland, took a while to improve Palace's fortunes after replacing Alan Pardew in December, but the Eagles are starting to reap the rewards of his methods when it matters.\nPalace had too much pace, power and passion for a lifeless Gunners side.\nAlthough Arsenal dominated possession in the first half, Palace had the better chances and deservedly led when Townsend drilled in Wilfried Zaha's cross from the right.\nPalace leaked goals under Pardew, but have discovered defensive resilience under Allardyce - leading to four clean sheets in their past six league games.\nThat run has coincided with the arrival of centre-back Mamadou Sakho, the loan signing from Liverpool who again led their backline with a determined and disciplined performance.\nIt laid the platform for Palace to go on and secure victory after the break.\nCabaye clipped Zaha's pass into the top corner before Gunners keeper Emiliano Martinez clumsily brought down Townsend, allowing Milivojevic to confidently tuck in his first Palace goal.\n\"Tactically the players were aware of what had to happen to beat Arsenal,\" said Allardyce.\n\"Arsenal have been weak defensively - they leave the centre-backs exposed.\"\nMan of the match - Andros Townsend (Crystal Palace)\nWhat the managers said\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce, speaking to Sky Sports: \"Tactically the players were aware of how to beat Arsenal. The first thing was to defend and frustrate them, keep them playing sideways, then use the space behind the full-backs. Arsenal have been weak defensively, they leave the centre-backs exposed.\n\"We won a lot of possession off them and created lots of chances. Cabaye's goal, what a finish - and that was down to us pressing them. It wasn't a shock for me because we played Chelsea and won that game. The result might be a shock, but we did that again and did it better.\n\"We all know Arsenal are going through their worst spell for years, but the only way to take advantage is by playing well. Everything worked perfectly for us today.\"\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Sport: \"We lost too many duels and we paid for that. There is no obvious reason why. We prepared well. It's difficult to explain just after the game.\n\"I don't think my players didn't want it, but we lost duels in decisive moments and that's how games are decided at this level.\n\"I understand our fans are disappointed and we all are deeply tonight. It's very worrying and disappointing the way we lost the game. Palace were sharp, they beat Chelsea the other day, and that shows they have quality.\n\"We are in a difficult position. The game doesn't help.\"\nArsenal's travel sickness continues - key stats\nArsene Wenger has suffered four consecutive away Premier League defeats for the first time as Arsenal manager.\nThis is Arsenal's worst away Premier League run since April 1995 (also four defeats in a row) when they were managed by Stewart Houston.\nWenger lost for the first time against Palace in 12 top-flight matches.\nArsenal conceded three goals in four consecutive away league games for the first time since September 1929.\nIn the past eight Premier League games, only Sunderland (six) have lost more games than Arsenal (five).\nWilfried Zaha has had a hand in five goals in his past five Premier League games (two goals, three assists).\nZaha now has nine Premier League assists for the season, matching the record held by Wayne Routledge in 2004-05.\nSam Allardyce has won three consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since he was West Ham boss in December 2014.\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace will look to earn the one win Allardyce believes they need to be assured of safety when they host Leicester on Saturday. Arsenal travel to Middlesbrough next Monday in a game with significant implications at both ends of the table."

        "article_text": "Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 Bournemouth\nTottenham made it seven top-flight wins in succession for the first time since 1967 and continued their pursuit of leaders Chelsea with a dominant victory over Bournemouth.\nThe game was essentially won in a three-minute period in the first half in which Mousa Dembele fired Spurs ahead from close range following a corner before Son Heung-min doubled the lead with a darting run and neat finish.\nHarry Kane, making his first start in a month, made sure of the three points with a low finish just minutes into the second half.\nThe strike makes the 23-year-old just the fourth player to score 20 Premier League goals in three consecutive seasons after Alan Shearer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Thierry Henry.\nVincent Janssen capped off Spurs' afternoon by scoring just his second Premier League goal of the season in injury time, just minutes after coming on as a substitute.\nMauricio Pochettino's side are now four points behind Chelsea, who face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.\nBournemouth, who managed one shot on target, are now without a win in four matches and remain seven points above the bottom three with six games left to play.\nSpurs run will make Chelsea nervous - Lampard\nRelive Tottenham's win over Bournemouth\nTottenham hitting peak at right time\nWith this win Tottenham surpassed the 70 points that gave them third place in 2015-16, during which they challenged for the Premier League trophy until their 36th fixture - a 2-2 draw at Chelsea.\nThe smart money remains on the Blues playing a more central role in extending Spurs' wait for a first title since 1961, especially if they win at United, but Pochettino's side are doing everything to capitalise on any potential slip-up.\nThis is a more mature, clinical and refined Tottenham side than 12 months ago, and this performance illustrated that perfectly.\nFrom the start they pressed their opponents relentlessly and dominated possession before the goals came.\nDembele's was a simple but emphatic finish following Christian Eriksen's corner. Son showed speed and guile to score after receiving a pass from Kane, whose goal was the result of great tenacity in winning the ball from Simon Francis in the box.\nThe biggest cheer of the afternoon, though, was reserved for the contribution of Janssen, who followed up his own blocked shot to score his sixth goal in his 35th appearance of what has been a tough first season in English football.\nSpurs have now scored the joint-most goals in the division, conceded the fewest and are hitting peak form at potentially just the right time.\nThey have also made White Hart Lane a fortress. This was their 12th victory in succession, making it their longest-ever winning streak on home soil in a single top-flight season.\nBournemouth looking over their shoulder\nBournemouth are now without a win in three, since last month's 2-0 win over Swansea which lifted them up to 11th.\nThis game was no barometer of their suitability for a possible relegation fight, simply because Tottenham were so good. But Eddie Howe's side were easily brushed aside, having now conceded three or more goals in 12 Premier League games.\nThey were second best in every department as Spurs bullied their defence, bossed midfield and denied Benik Afobe and Joshua King any sight of goal.\nTheir only shot on target came in the 74th minute, when Charlie Daniels' long-range effort gave Hugo Lloris the simplest of saves.\nTheir dismal afternoon was compounded when on-loan midfielder Jack Wilshere limped off injured following a tackle on Kane in his own box.\nMan of the match - Mousa Dembele (Tottenham)\n'The three points are very important to keep our dream.'\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I am proud of our players after that performance. We have to wait to see what happens.\n\"Harry Kane is a fantastic player - he is one of the best in England and it is fantastic he is fit again to help the team.\n\"Son is brilliant - he needed time to adapt his game but he is now fit and healthy and he is feeling really comfortable.\n\"I was happy for Vincent Janssen because I knew it was his only chance to score and it's important he feels the happiness when you score.\n\"At the end of the season when everyone is tired, we need everyone to have the right mental attitude and happiness helps. We now need everyone to rest and get ready for the next few games.\n\"The three points are very important to keep our dream.\"\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We know we need more. We've known all along.\n\"The danger is if everyone says, 'You're safe.' We've got to focus the players' minds that we're not.\"\nEriksen the league's top provider - the stats you need to know\nBournemouth posted a 31.31% possession figure in this game, their lowest ever in a Premier League game.\nSpurs have scored the most (43) and conceded the fewest (eight) home goals in the Premier League this season.\nChristian Eriksen now has more assists than any other player in the Premier League this season (12).\nSon Heung-min has been directly involved in six goals in his past four Premier League games (five goals, one assist).\nHarry Kane has provided five Premier League assists this season, his best-ever return in a top-flight campaign.\nVincent Janssen finally netted his first Premier League goal not to come from the penalty spot in his 24th appearance in the competition.\nWhat next?\nTottenham await the result of Chelsea's game at Old Trafford and then face the Blues in the FA Cup semi-finals next weekend. They return to league action on Wednesday, 26 April at Crystal Palace.\nBournemouth have two big Premier League games to come this month - next Saturday's home game against Middlesbrough, followed seven days later by a trip to Sunderland."

        "article_text": "Watford 1-0 Swansea City\nSwansea defender Alfie Mawson made a costly error as his side were beaten by Watford at Vicarage Road to remain two points adrift of Premier League safety.\nAfter an uneventful first 40 minutes, Mawson took too much time on the ball in a dangerous area and Etienne Capoue, on his return from injury, nicked the ball off the young defender and fired home at the second time of asking.\nSwans captain Gylfi Sigurdsson strolled through the Watford defence right at the death but gave Heurelho Gomes an easy save as his side fell to their sixth straight away defeat. Their only consolation is that relegation rivals Hull were well beaten at Stoke.\nSwansea, now winless in six Premier League games, face a continued battle to survive, but Walter Mazzarri's Watford look to have earned another season of Premier League football.\nRelive Watford's win over Swansea\nSigurdsson was once again the bright spark for Swansea and had their best chance of the first half, but his effort was turned away by Gomes at his left post.\nWatford captain Troy Deeney, reinstated to the starting XI after he was dropped to the bench for their 4-0 loss to Tottenham, could have put his side ahead but his first-time shot was tipped over the bar by Swans keeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nThe game looked to be winding down to half-time when centre-back Mawson hesitated in a dangerous area and, as he turned to send the ball back to Fabianksi, Capoue stormed in.\nThe Watford midfielder's first shot was blocked by Swansea keeper Fabianksi, but his rebound found the target as Swansea looked stunned.\nThe second half offered very little, but Watford's defence, which has been leaky of late, looked far more assured with Sebastian Prodl back in the mix and they held on to take all three points.\nSwans slowly sinking\nPaul Clement took over from Bob Bradley as Swansea manager in January and saw an initial upturn in form after his appointment - he won three of his first four games in charge.\nAnd his side were five points clear of the bottom three at the start of March.\nBut a horror run of just one point from six games has seen them slide back into the relegation zone - a stalemate with Middlesbrough is all Clement's men have to show for their efforts in recent weeks.\nSwansea have five games left to secure their top-flight survival and extend their six-year run in the Premier League.\nIt looks increasingly like it could be a straight shootout with Hull City, who sit just two points above them having lost 3-1 at Stoke on Saturday.\nBut of the two, Swansea look to have the trickier fixtures, with next week's home game against Stoke probably one they have to win.\nMazzarri marching on\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri's fears of a slide down the table towards the end of the season will have been eased by his side's third home win in a row.\nAnd the three points, which keep Watford 10th in the the table, will also have delighted the club's somewhat over-zealous owners.\nThe Pozzo family completed a takeover of the club back in 2012 - and have seen eight managers during their time in charge.\nWanting to improve on a disappointing end to the 2015-16 season, they let manager Quique Sanchez Flores go with the club in 13th place - and his predecessor's fate will surely be at the forefront of Mazzarri's mind.\nThe Italian has faced criticism this season over his grasp of the English language and coaching techniques.\nBut his side, who have been plagued by injuries in recent weeks, were buoyed by the return of Capoue and ground out a tough victory.\nThey can start preparing for life in the Premier League next season - a campaign Mazzarri plans on being a part of.\nMan of the match - Etienne Capoue\nMOTD analysis: Swansea low on confidence\nFormer Chelsea and England midfielder Frank Lampard: \"I understand if Paul Clement seemed downcast at full-time. It was disappointing from Swansea's perspective - the one thing you expect as a manager is effort and a desire to get out of the situation they are in. That was slightly lacking from the start today.\nSwansea were short in their energy and what they put into the game. It's a confidence issue - they are on a bad run and gave sloppy balls away throughout the game.\n\"It looks like a straight fight now between Swansea and Hull for that last relegation position. I watched Hull today and they are a team creating chances. You can see that they have some momentum.\"\n'We need three wins out of five to stay up' - what the managers said\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri:\n\"We knew it was going to be a very tough game. We could have killed the game off but we didn't and we had to suffer until the end.\n\"It is normal that when a new manager comes, he has to give his identity to the team and it takes a bit of time. Now the squad are playing good football.\n\"Until the numbers say we are safe, we are not. I don't want my players to relax and I want to play with the same formation in order to get ready for next season.\"\nSwansea boss Paul Clement:\n\"I think we did enough defensively. The goal has come for an individual error and Alfie [Mawson] knew that straight away. It's a big mistake.\n\"Offensively we got the ball into some good areas but we were missing a clinical edge in the final third. That for me was the difference.\n\"We had over 45 minutes to try and get out of that situation but we couldn't get the breakthrough.\n\"Hull not winning today keeps things the same but for me it's a missed opportunity not to get a point today.\n\"The next one is a must-win game for us. It's the biggest game the club has had in years.\n\"We will probably need three wins out of the last five to stay up. And I'm not even sure that would be enough.\"\nWatford's French fancies - the stats\nWatford have kept three consecutive clean sheets on home soil in the Premier League for the first time since September 2015.\nEtienne Capoue netted his first goal in 19 Premier League games, after bagging five in his previous 12 this season.\n11 of Watford's Premier League goals have come from French players (Capoue, Kaboul, Niang and Doucoure), a national haul only Arsenal can match this season.\nThe Hornets have won three of their past four top-flight games (L1) after failing to win any of the four before that (D1 L3).\nThe Swans have failed to score in four of their past five Premier League games (one goal scored in the other), after finding the back of the net in seven in a row.\nThe away side has never scored in any of the four Premier League games between these two sides.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea are at home to Stoke, while Watford host the Swans' relegation rivals Hull - both games are next Saturday and 15:00 BST kick-offs."

The Sun has since apologised for the article and suspended MacKenzie.\nBarkley's response was to turn in a superb performance. He was in the right place in the first half to clear Keane's goal-bound header off the line following a George Boyd corner, and played a significant role in Everton's second goal.\nThe England international collected a Kevin Mirallas pass and weaved in from the left to hit a cross-shot that struck both Keane and Mee before bobbling into the far corner.\nHe ran to the Gwladys Street End to celebrate - collecting a booking for doing so - but, unfortunately for him, the goal was attributed to Mee.\nIt was still a day to remember for Barkley, who received a standing ovation when he was substituted towards the end.\nBarkley has yet to agree an extension to a contract that runs out at the end of next season, and Everton's fans will hope a new deal can be agreed.\nLukaku proves priceless\nLukaku, like Barkley, faces uncertainty over his future at Everton after failing to agree a contract extension.\nManager Ronald Koeman revealed on Thursday that Lukaku, who is keen to play in the Champions League, has refused to extend a deal that has two years to run.\nYet the Belgium international - nominated for the Professional Footballers' Association's player and young player of the year awards this week - is unaffected by those off-field issues.\nHe was largely well policed by Keane and Mee, but when he got a chance he was ruthless.\nThe league's top scorer received a pass from Leighton Baines, spun away from Keane and fired a shot between Tom Heaton and his near post to ensure victory.\nFormer Everton manager Roberto Martinez, who paid \u00a328m for Lukaku three years ago, suggested during the week that the striker is now worth treble that. With such ruthless finishing, it is hard to argue.\nAway-day hope for Burnley\nBurnley remain the only team in the Premier League without an away victory this season - yet there was encouragement for them in defeat.\nKoeman said the visitors were the better side for the first half-hour, with Keane's header cleared off the line and Vokes denied twice by goalkeeper Robles.\nWhen they went behind to Jagielka's header - turned over the line after Ashley Williams flicked on a corner - they responded instantly.\nRobles should take the blame for bringing down Vokes needlessly, but the striker kept his cool to slot in only Burnley's 10th away goal of the season, five of which have been penalties.\nHeaton, celebrating his 31st birthday, made several good saves to keep Burnley in it, and they looked good for at least a point as Everton laboured.\nThe disappointment for manager Sean Dyche would lie in the way they lost their defensive discipline briefly to allow Everton to score two quick goals and seal victory.\nMan of the match - Ross Barkley (Everton)\nParty like it's 1990 - Everton's home run\nEverton have won eight successive Premier League games at Goodison Park for the first time in the Premier League - their best top-flight run since winning eight in a row between January and April 1990.\nThe Toffees have already scored more goals at Goodison Park this season than in their previous 26 top-flight campaigns (41 goals).\nOnly one team in Premier League history have had fewer away points after 17 Premier League games than Burnley (Derby - three points in 2007-08).\nThere were just 126 seconds between Phil Jagielka's goal and Sam Vokes winning Burnley's penalty at Goodison Park.\nLeighton Baines is the first defender to reach 50 Premier League assists.\nPhil Jagielka has scored in each of his past three games for Everton; as many as he had scored in his previous 71 in the Premier League.\nAshley Williams has himself assisted in Everton's last three Premier League games - he had only recorded three assists in his previous 209 Premier League appearances.\nAnalysis\nKevin Kilbane, former Everton winger on BBC Final Score\n\"I think Ross Barkley handled today's pressure really well. He cleared the ball off the line at one point and generally succeeded in having an influence on the game.\n\"His manager Ronald Koeman will be impressed with how he's handled the off-the-field distractions this week.\"\n'Ross is just a normal lad'\nEverton captain Phil Jagielka, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I've known Ross a long time now and nothing fazes him.\n\"These things can happen. We had an academy day a couple of days ago, and he was part of that.\n\"He's just a normal lad who wants to play football. I'll give him the goal even though it's gone down as an own goal.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"We know all that kind of stuff off the pitch is not the best, but Ross dealt really well with that and showed today he was focused. He showed his qualities in the second half.\n\"It took 30 minutes to understand what we needed to do today because Burnley were a top opponent. They showed more aggression than we showed. We were lucky not to be down in the first 30 minutes, but the second half was much better.\n\"The goal now is to give competition to the teams above us. If we finish strong at the end of the season, then everything is possible.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"It's a tough one to take, I thought we were good today. We had two cleared off the line and two good chances.\n\"We've been punished by a bobbly first goal, a bobbly second one and then a great finish from a top striker. It's a good performance on the road that suggests we will get there in the end.\n\"There's life in performances like that. We've got to take it on now. We do need a margin of luck.\"\nWhat's next?\nEverton visit West Ham next Saturday, with Burnley at home to Manchester United the following day."

        "article_text": "Crystal Palace 2-2 Leicester City\nCrystal Palace edged further towards Premier League survival as they fought back from two goals down in an absorbing draw with Leicester at Selhurst Park.\nThe Foxes took the lead on six minutes as the hosts' lax defending allowed Robert Huth to rise and head in Christian Fuchs' long throw.\nLeicester boss Craig Shakespeare had opted not to rest the majority of his stars before Tuesday's Champions League return against Atletico Madrid, and was vindicated when Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy combined to make it 2-0.\nThe visitors broke from a Palace corner, with Mahrez setting Vardy free before the England striker cut back inside former Foxes defender Jeffrey Schlupp to curl his shot beyond Wayne Hennessey.\nIt was a goal reminiscent of Leicester's title-winning exploits last season, but this year's defensive frailties returned less than two minutes later when Yohan Cabaye reacted quickest to Schlupp's blocked shot to sweep home.\nChristian Benteke completed Palace's comeback on 70 minutes, overpowering Yohan Benalouane to convert Andros Townsend's cross, though Danny Drinkwater went close to a winner for the visitors late on.\nReaction to Saturday's Premier League games\nRelive the action from Selhurst Park\nA point gained or two lost?\nBoth Shakespeare and Palace counterpart Sam Allardyce were asked after the game whether the draw was a point gained or two points lost.\nAllardyce called it a \"precious point\" while Shakespeare was more unsure, but both will ultimately reflect on this game as an entertaining facet of two remarkable runs that have taken their seemingly doomed, under-performing sides to almost guaranteed safety.\nFor both sides, this was a first draw in a run of seven Premier League games also featuring one defeat and five victories.\nIt was perhaps fitting, then, that they were so evenly matched.\nThe pace and trickery of Wilfried Zaha and Townsend tested Leicester's resolute defence under Shakespeare, while Mahrez, Vardy and the excellent Marc Albrighton were able to do the same to Allardyce's organised Eagles.\nThough their recent runs should not disguise the fact this has been a season of under-achievement in the league for two talented sides, with Palace now seven points above the relegation zone and Leicester two points further clear, the unthinkable should be avoided.\nShakespeare's latest audition\nHaving fielded a much-changed line-up for a 4-2 defeat at Everton prior to Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg in Madrid, Shakespeare backed up his conviction the Foxes are not yet safe in the league by making only two changes.\nIt was the latest bold decision from Claudio Ranieri's former assistant as he attempts to secure the job on a long-term basis.\nAgain, Shakespeare's judgement proved sound as Palace looked entirely unprepared to face a side that could hurt them both on the break and from set-pieces, with Fuchs' long throw a potent weapon throughout.\nShould they come up short against Atletico, who lead the tie 1-0, the Foxes players may rue their involvement in what was - at times - a frantic match.\nBut, in many ways, playing an untypically strong team before a crucial European tie was a typically Leicester thing to do - confounding expectations and playing with nerveless verve and spirit - all things oddly lacking this season under Ranieri.\nBenteke gives Palace extra edge\nWhile Zaha, Townsend and Jason Puncheon were not short of trickery to menace the Leicester defence through the middle, Palace's reward ultimately came from getting the ball wide and delivering well-placed crosses.\nWith Huth in fine form, that tactic would have been futile but for Benteke, whose physical presence finally won out.\nThe Belgium striker refused to be denied, climbing on the back of Benalouane - still deputising for the injured Wes Morgan - to power his header past Kasper Schmeichel.\nLeicester were livid - Vardy claiming Benteke had used his team-mate \"like a stepladder\" - but could not claim to be surprised, with Benteke having threatened all game.\nBenteke now has 12 Premier League goals this season and three in his past four games, giving Palace the extra dimension that should see them to safety.\nMan of the match - Marc Albrighton (Leicester)\nManager reaction\nCrystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce: \"The point feels like a win. It's a tremendous fightback from the players and that wouldn't have happened when I first arrived - it just shows the change of mood of the players.\n\"We've got 35 points now and it's been a fantastic run of results.\n\"I spend a bit of time boring the players with getting the basics right but they are the basis of any result - for those Leicester goals we didn't get the basics right, although Jamie Vardy took his goal brilliantly.\"\nLeicester boss Craig Shakespeare: \"There is a tinge of disappointment as we just needed to manage the game better after our second goal.\n\"For their second, I've seen them given as a free-kick - Benteke is riding on Benalouane's back - but there's nothing we can do about it as the referee has given it.\n\"We've not got enough of a gap [to the bottom three]. Teams can go on a run, as we've proved, so we need to keep that momentum going.\"\nPalace home fortunes improved - stats\nPalace are unbeaten in their past four Premier League games at Selhurst Park (W3 D1), their longest unbeaten streak since February 2014 (four games unbeaten).\nLeicester have taken more points under Shakespeare in his three Premier League away games (four) than in the previous 13 managed by Ranieri (three).\nTownsend has been directly involved in seven Premier League goals this season (three goals, four assists); his best return in a top-flight campaign.\nBenteke has scored 21 Premier League headed goals since his debut in September 2012; only Olivier Giroud (24) has scored more.\nVardy has been involved in eight goals in his past seven Premier League appearances since Shakespeare's appointment (six goals, two assists).\nWhat's next?\nPalace travel to Liverpool on Sunday, 23 April (16:30 BST), before another tough encounter, hosting Tottenham on Wednesday, 26 April (20:00 BST).\nLeicester host Atletico Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday (19:45 BST), before travelling to Arsenal on Wednesday, 26 April (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Stoke City 3-1 Hull City\nXherdan Shaqiri's superb strike sealed a first Premier League win in six games for Stoke City as Mark Hughes' men proved too strong for relegation-threatened Hull.\nShaqiri, whose last goals came in the reverse fixture against the Tigers in October, took aim from 30 yards to deliver an unstoppable shot beyond the reach of Eldin Jakupovic.\nMarko Arnautovic had earlier put the hosts into an early lead with a thumping strike before spurning two glorious chances to add to his tally.\nHarry Maguire hauled Hull level with an untidy finish, but a double substitution by the hosts provided key as Jon Walters crossed for fellow replacement Peter Crouch to restore the lead.\nHull are now winless in 16 away league games dating back to August, but remain two points outside the relegation zone thanks to Swansea's loss at Watford.\nStoke, meanwhile, climb to 11th after convincingly avoiding the ignominy of losing five top-flight league games for the first time since 1985.\nRelive Stoke's win over Hull\nSaturday's other Premier League matches\nOld stagers turn the tide\nA few boos greeted Hughes' decision to make a double substitution just before the hour mark, the withdrawal of Saido Berahino in particular appearing to irk some of the Stoke fans.\nThe change came just seven minutes after Hull had equalised, and with the visitors looking the most likely to add to their tally Hughes was forced to act.\nThrowing on Crouch and Walters - with a combined age of 69 - was a calculated move by the Stoke manager designed to unsettle Hull's towering backline, who while uncertain on the ground had been winning most balls in the air.\nWithin two minutes of their introduction, former Hull striker Walters forced Jakupovic into a fine save from a diving header, but that was just the prelude to what was to come.\nWith 66 minutes gone, Walters picked the ball up on the left and delivered a perfect cross for Crouch, who needed the whole of his 6ft 7in frame to rise above Andrea Ranocchia and score for the first time since he registered his 100th Premier League goal against Everton in February.\nHull came close to levelling a second time when Kamil Grosicki cut inside and forced Lee Grant into a smart low save, but any hopes the visitors had of snatching a point were emphatically ended by Shaqiri, whose long-range effort was just his fourth goal of the season - three of which have come against Hull.\nWhat now for Hull?\nAlthough this is a painful defeat for the Tigers, they at least end the weekend with their fate in their own hands as their two-point gap to the bottom three remains intact with five games to go.\nCrucially, three of those are at home, where they have picked up 16 of the 17 points they have earned since Marco Silva was appointed in January. Should that form continue in games with Watford, Sunderland and Tottenham, they might just survive.\nBut the feeling is Hull need to pick up something on their travels if they are to beat the drop.\nThey showed enough against Stoke to suggest they are quite capable of ending their seven-game winless run away from home in the Silva era, but to do that they will need to be more clinical in front of goal in their remaining road trips to Southampton and Crystal Palace.\nMan of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri (Stoke City)\n'The icing on the cake'\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"It was a big three points, an important three points. We've come through a period that was arguably our most testing of the season in terms of fixtures.\n\"For the most part this season we've picked up points against the teams below us and that's what we've done today.\n\"We eventually needed to make a change to get a bit more threat and they helped. Jon Walters plonked it on Crouch's head and the game's done from my point of view. Shaqiri's goal was the icing on the cake.\n\"As a consequence of winning today I think we can probably express ourselves a bit more in the remaining games.\"\nHull boss Marco Silva: \"I'm not happy with our performance in general. We need to do more. We need to improve. At this level we need to start strong and play 90 minutes, not 80 minutes.\n\"Our team only played 80 minutes because the first 10 we didn't play. We can't start the game like we started.\n\"Only our team can change the situation. Five more games, the next game is a chance for more points.\"\nMore Stoke misery for Hull - the stats\nStoke now have a 60% win rate against Hull in the Premier League; their highest percentage against a team they've played at least 10 times.\nHull remain winless away from home under Marco Silva in the league (L6 D1), despite being unbeaten at home (W5 D1) - the only other two managers to do the same having managed at least five games home and away, was Rafa Benitez at Newcastle in 2015-16 and David Webb at Chelsea in 1992-93.\nMarko Arnautovic has been directly involved in 10 Premier League goals this term (six goals, four assists); the most of any Stoke City player.\nEach of Xherdan Shaqiri's past five goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside of the box.\nHalf of Shaqiri's assists in the Premier League have been for Marko Arnautovic (four of eight), with all four coming at home.\nAfter keeping two clean sheets in their first four league games under Marco Silva, Hull have since conceded in nine consecutive outings.\nHarry Maguire netted in back-to-back league games for the first time in his career (two goals) - he had scored twice in his previous 93 league outings prior to this run.\nThe Potters have scored 59% of their league goals in the first half this season, the highest proportion of any Premier League side.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea, Hull's rivals in the relegation battle, are next up for Stoke, who travel to the Liberty Stadium next Saturday (15:00 BST). The Tigers welcome Watford to the KCOM at the same time."

It wasn't for the want of trying [that we didn't].\n\"I thought the boys played really well, they showed great character to come back.\n\"We'll keep believing while we're in with a chance, and somewhere along the line hope the football gods will shine on us.\"\nOn defender Billy Jones, who was stretchered off: \"The medical team tell me his head hit the ground and he lost consciousness, a bit of concussion. We've sent him to hospital, but I'm sure he'll be OK.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We are disappointed to concede a late goal. It was a fair result. It is a point, we wanted three and we were close.\n\"They were throwing long balls in, putting the bodies in, from one of those situations they score the goal.\n\"We have four points from the last two games, we have an unfinished job to do. We have to pick up more points to be safe.\"\nStats - Hammers throw away more points\nSunderland are without a win in their last eight top-flight games (D2 L6) and have won only one of their last 15.\nWest Ham have thrown away a league-high 22 points from leading positions in the Premier League this season.\nWest Ham have now gone 13 games without a clean sheet away from home in the Premier League.\nWahbi Khazri's goal was the first to come direct from a corner since Ben Watson for Watford against Manchester City in January 2016.\nFabio Borini's two Premier League goals this season have both come in the 90th minute.\nWest Ham have been shown more red cards than any other side in the Premier League this season (five).\nWhat's next?\nSunderland travel to Middlesbrough, currently one place above them in 19th, on Wednesday, 26 April, before hosting Bournemouth three days later.\nWest Ham welcome Everton next Saturday, before a visit to Stoke a week later."

I keep positive and keep going no matter what.\"\nSlick City looking good for top four?\nGuardiola might have thought winning the Premier League during his first season in English football would be relatively straightforward after starting with seven successive wins.\nInstead, the Spaniard goes into the top-flight run-in facing a tense wait to see if his team are good enough to finish in the top four.\nIf City play with this sort of defensive resilience, in conjunction with their already lethal attacking play, it will be hard to see either Everton or Manchester United overhauling them.\nOnce the visitors took a deserved lead, they looked resolute at the back and picked off Saints on the break with a clinical counter-attack to double their advantage.\nDe Bruyne led the charge as City broke quickly, expertly picking out Sane for the young German to drill low under Forster.\nDe Bruyne was also the architect for the third, clipping a right-wing cross to the far post for Aguero to secure City's first win in four away matches.\n\"This result is so important for our qualification for the Champions League,\" said Guardiola, whose side host neighbours United in their next league game.\n\"It will go to the last game for the Champions League. It will be so tough.\"\nSaints marching on... to a mid-table finish\nSouthampton look almost certain to fall short of emulating last season's sixth-place finish as Puel's first campaign at the helm is petering out to a quiet conclusion.\nSaints will need a remarkable finish to grab European qualification and, having already passed the 40-point mark deemed enough to avoid relegation, are well clear of the drop.\nTheir performance against City was indicative of a side with little to play for going into the final month of the season.\nThe home side only managed one effort on target, and Maya Yoshida's second-half header was easily stopped by Bravo.\n\"We simply did not play well enough, we were nervous with the ball,\" said Puel, who replaced Ronald Koeman last summer.\nMan of the match - Vincent Kompany (Manchester City)\nWhat's next?\nCity's attentions are diverted away from the Champions League chase and onto the pursuit of silverware as they meet Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final next Sunday (15:00 BST).\nGuardiola's side return to Premier League action when they host neighbours United on Thursday, 27 April (20:00).\nSaints have a 10-day break before returning with a trip to leaders Chelsea on Tuesday, 25 April (19:45).\nNo away-day Blues....\nCity have won 11 away games this season, more than they have in any other top-flight campaign.\nGuardiola has made 100 changes to his Premier League starting line-ups this season, 15 more than any other manager.\nSince his debut in August 2010, Silva has provided 64 Premier League assists - 13 more than any other player.\nDe Bruyne is the Premier League's leading assist maker this season, having set up 13 goals.\nSane has scored in three of his past four Premier League away games.\nAguero has scored in each of his past 12 Premier League appearances in the month of April\nPost-match reaction\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"I missed Vincent Kompany a lot. He wins duels, he can find passes to help us, so hopefully he can be fit until the end of the season because he's important for us.\n\"With all the injured players, Gabriel Jesus, Ilkay Gundogan, we would have been stronger.\"\nOn whether City can catch the top two: \"Tottenham are so strong. We saw again today that they are not going to drop points.\n\"Our performance away in that league was amazing this season. We dropped too many points at home.\n\"Look how strong Chelsea and Tottenham are at home. If you want to win the Premier League, you have to win at home to Middlesbrough and Southampton.\"\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"It's a disappointment because we can do better, we can create better opportunities.\n\"We did not have enough, we were not sufficient.

        "article_text": "West Bromwich Albion 0-1 Liverpool\nRoberto Firmino scored a winner for the second weekend running as Liverpool beat West Brom to go third in the Premier League.\nThe Brazil striker headed in at the end of the first half after Lucas Leiva had glanced on James Milner's free-kick.\nMilner volleyed over after half-time, and Simon Mignolet saved with his legs from Matt Phillips at the other end.\nLate on, Alberto Moreno missed an empty goal from 40 yards after Albion keeper Ben Foster had gone up for a corner.\nDespite that miss, Jurgen Klopp's side secured a fifth win in seven games, sending West Brom to a third straight defeat.\nRelive West Brom v Liverpool as it happened\nLiverpool find their ugly side\nKlopp has spoken recently of the need for Liverpool to \"win ugly\" - having developed a habit of beating the Premier League's top teams and then slipping up against sides lower down.\nLiverpool's manager was particularly wary of the threat that West Brom might pose from set-pieces, an area in which his team have been vulnerable defensively this season.\nTo counter that danger, Klopp used the fierce winds that hit Merseyside last Wednesday to his advantage - getting his players to face a barrage of high crosses and long throws in training that day.\nThe manager's reasoning was that if his players could deal with the ball in the air as it swirled about in the wind, they would be able to handle anything West Brom threw at them.\nBy and large, the preparation worked - with Liverpool also making sure not to give away too many set-pieces - although there was one hairy moment in the first half when Nacer Chadli miskicked with the goal at his mercy after Liverpool had failed to defend a free-kick.\nWhat was particularly impressive about Liverpool, though, was their midfield domination, which restricted the home side to just a handful of efforts at goal.\nLucas, Georginio Wijnaldum and Emre Can were key to keeping West Brom at bay, and ensured a win that keeps Klopp's side well on course for next season's Champions League.\nNo Mane? No problem\nBefore last weekend's trip to Stoke, Liverpool had not won a league game all season without Sadio Mane in the team.\nKlopp needed that statistic to change after a knee injury sustained against Everton on 1 April ended the Senegalese striker's season early.\nHe found inspiration in the Potteries as goals from Philippe Coutinho and Firmino sealed a 2-1 victory, and the two Brazil internationals were involved in Liverpool's best attacking moments at The Hawthorns.\nFirmino proved his value in terms of creating chances as well as getting the winner, providing a fine diagonal pass that Coutinho volleyed wide in the first half, and crossing for Milner to volley over when well placed in the second.\nLiverpool could have won by a greater margin with better finishing - with Moreno guilty of the most glaring miss.\nThe full-back, on as a substitute, burst away in the closing seconds after keeper Foster was caught upfield for a corner. Instead of running the ball into the net, Moreno elected to shoot from long range, and missed the target.\nAlbion fall flat\nWest Brom remain on course to finish eighth, and equal their highest final league placing since 1981, but their season is in danger of petering out.\nOf their past seven matches, Tony Pulis' side have lost five and failed to score in six, with a 3-1 win over Arsenal on 18 March providing their only win and goals during that run.\nAlbion under Pulis have made a habit of being well organised, and of digging out victories with a significantly smaller share of possession.\nBut they failed to cause Liverpool enough problems, managing just two shots on target all afternoon.\nHal Robson-Kanu hit the first tamely at Mignolet in the opening half, and the goalkeeper reacted well to save with his legs as Phillips ran clear with 10 minutes to go.\nEven when they won a series of set-pieces in the closing moments, they could not make Liverpool pay.\nMan of the match - Emre Can (Liverpool)\nFirmino hits fine form\nRoberto Firmino has now surpassed his Premier League goal tally from last season (10 in 2015-16, 11 in 2016-17).\nSince the start of last season, Firmino has been directly involved in 34 Premier League goals (21 goals, 13 assists), more than any other Liverpool player.\nLiverpool have won 66 points from 33 games this season; six points more than they picked up in the whole of 2015-16.\nWest Brom have failed to score in four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2003.\nLiverpool have scored in more league away games this season (14) than they did in 2015-16 (13).\nLucas has provided two assists in a Premier League season for the first time since 2009-10.\nWest Brom have lost three of their past four Premier League games at The Hawthorns, as many as they lost in their previous 14 combined.\nLiverpool kept only their second ;eague clean sheet in 2017, in what was their 14th game of this calendar year.\n'No set-pieces, no set-pieces, no set-pieces'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a big win against a good, tall team. We played really well from the first second.\n\"We needed to adapt to what West Brom wanted to do. In all our plans, it was 'no set-pieces, no set-pieces, no set-pieces'.\"\nOn Liverpool's Champions League qualification chances: \"It is the Premier League, Arsenal have three, four, five games in hand so we should not think about this. Today we could only get to 66 points, so it feels perfect.\n\"Next week we try at Anfield to get 69 points, and let's carry on. If we do what we have to do, we will be where we want to be.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We are disappointed. I thought we did enough to get a point.\n\"The goal really knocked us. It took us 20 minutes, in which time they had some good opportunities.\n\"Chadli had a great chance at the back post, Matty Phillips should have scored one-on-one, Hal should have scored one-on-one - it wasn't all set-pieces.\n\"The difference between the top teams is the quality they have up front. The players have been fantastic this year, we have an opportunity to play some of the young players now too.\"\nWhat next?\nWest Brom are at home to Leicester next Saturday (15:00 BST); Liverpool host Crystal Palace a day later at 16:30."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 2-0 Chelsea\nChelsea's lead at the top of the Premier League now stands at only four points and the title race is wide open again after they were well beaten by a resurgent Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nUnited manager Jose Mourinho has suffered this season against the club where he was a three-time champion, losing 4-0 in the league at Chelsea and also going out of the FA Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Portuguese was not to be denied this time as Marcus Rashford, paired with Jesse Lingard up front while a jaded Zlatan Ibrahimovic was rested, finished coolly after seven minutes and Ander Herrera - detailed to do a brilliant man-marking job on Eden Hazard - saw his shot deflected in off Kurt Zouma four minutes after the break.\nZouma was a late replacement for Marcos Alonso, who pulled out in the warm-up, but Chelsea can offer no excuses here as they were second best throughout. Tottenham now trail them by four points with six games to go and have the superior goal difference.\nAnalysis - A Mourinho masterclass, with a twist\nRelive Manchester United's victory over Chelsea\nListen: Spurs fan on 606 - \"If we had Rashford we would win the league\"\nChelsea stumble in their title stroll\nChelsea looked to be strolling to the title just a few weeks ago - but a sudden stumble, including the home defeat by struggling Crystal Palace, and an irresistible surge from Spurs have brought renewed edge to the run-in.\nConte will feel his side did not enjoy the best of luck here, with keeper Thibaut Courtois ruled out with a training injury, Alonso withdrawn after the warm-up and referee Bobby Madley missing what appeared to be a clear handball from Herrera as he intercepted Nemanja Matic's pass before sending Rashford clear for the opener.\nThe Blues are still in a strong position but they are now feeling the hot breath of Spurs on their neck after Pochettino's team made it seven successive league wins for the first time since 1967 with a 4-0 home win over Bournemouth on Saturday.\nSo Spurs have momentum - but Chelsea still have a four-point lead, which counts for a lot with only six games left.\nThe Blues' run-in also looks a little kinder, with home games against Southampton, Middlesbrough, Watford and Sunderland - but a real test to come at Everton.\nThe pressure, however, is now applied and there may be twists left in this race. Spurs will feel renewed hope.\nMourinho's tactical masterclass\nMourinho's starting line-up raised eyebrows, with Ibrahimovic on the bench and Anthony Martial nowhere to be seen - but the end result, and the manner of United's victory, demonstrated just how brilliantly he had set up his team.\nWith Ibrahimovic out, the pace and movement of Rashford and Lingard offered the sort of threat that troubled Chelsea instantly. Rashford had missed one good chance before coolly directing a finish past Begovic early on.\nThe real masterstroke, however, was his decision to deploy Herrera as Hazard's shadow throughout. The Belgian, who Conte felt was a deliberate target for physical punishment in the recent FA Cup quarter-final, was totally snuffed out by Herrera, who covered his every move and forced him to the margins on a miserable afternoon for Chelsea.\nAnd, to make Mourinho's day complete, it was Herrera who escaped Hazard's attentions to find space in the area and send that deflected shot high into the net at the Stretford End for the home side's crucial second goal.\nCan Chelsea bounce back?\nThis was a bitterly disappointing display by Conte's side but it was only their fifth league defeat of the season.\nToo many of their big players failed to make an impact, with Hazard nullified and striker Diego Costa falling back into bad old ways, seemingly more intent on conducting a running battle with Marcos Rojo and Eric Bailly than pose a threat.\nChelsea will also feel they got the rough end of the refereeing decisions, but in the end United were dominant\nConte will be disappointed but his side are still title favourites, with that slender lead but also a favourable remaining programme.\nMan of the match - Ander Herrera (Manchester United)\n'I don't feel extra joy at beating Chelsea'\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to Match of the Day: \"It was the same plan that was working with 11 players in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge. They are the best counter-attacking team in the country and we controlled them very well.\n\"I'm really happy with the boys. I'm happy - it's not because it's Chelsea, it's because we need these three points.\n\"I don't feel extra joy at beating Chelsea - we beat the leader. It doesn't matter if the leader is Chelsea or another - we beat them convincingly. Nobody can doubt our credit to win the game.\"\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte, speaking to Match of the Day: \"Manchester United deserved to win because they showed more desire, more motivation, more ambition to win this game.\n\"It is simple. The fault is mine, because this type of situation the fault is the coach. I wasn't able to transfer the right concentration, the right motivation.\n\"This league is not closed. Tottenham are on great form and playing with great enthusiasm, but we are playing a great season and we must try to reach this target.\n\"We started as underdogs and it won't be easy.\"\nMourinho completes the set - the key stats\nJose Mourinho has now recorded at least one league victory against all 34 Premier League clubs he has faced as a manager.\nAnder Herrera scored and provided an assist in the same Premier League game for the first time since October 2015 versus Everton.\nRashford's goal was the earliest Chelsea had conceded in the Premier League since December 2013 (Skrtel, third minute for Liverpool).\nChelsea have gone 10 Premier League games without keeping a clean sheet for the first time since December 1996 (13 games).\nManchester United's Premier League unbeaten run now stands at 22 matches (W12 D10), the longest within a single season by a team since United themselves in 2010-11 (24).\nBefore this defeat, Chelsea had gone nine Premier League games unbeaten against Manchester United (W4 D4), last losing to them in October 2012.\nChelsea also failed to have a shot on target in a Premier League match for the first time since September 2007, which was also versus Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nWhat next?\nUnited host Anderlecht in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday, with the tie currently at 1-1. They then return to Premier League action at Burnley next Sunday.\nChelsea's next game is against their title rivals Tottenham, not in the Premier League but the FA Cup semi-finals, next Saturday. Their next league game is the following Tuesday, at home to Southampton."

That shows you that even at my age, you can change,\" Wenger said after the game when explaining his tactical switch.\n\"I felt it added a bit more stability on the long balls. We faced a direct game and we have been punished a bit on that. It gave the opponents more of the ball but against Crystal Palace we had 70% possession but lost.\"\nMiddlesbrough have scored the fewest amount of Premier League goals at home all season - just 12 prior to Arsenal's visit - and with the quality of Sanchez and Ozil in attack the visitors were always capable of snatching a lead. That proved to be the case when they scored from only their second shot on target just before the break, Sanchez expertly steering a free-kick over a packed wall and into the far corner.\nArsenal's lack of experience playing 3-4-3 was evident early in the second half when Downing charged away down an exposed right flank on the counter before providing the perfect ball for Negredo to poke in his ninth of the season.\nThe game opened up after that but Ozil's goal midway through the second half ensured Arsenal escaped with the points. It was a welcome win for under-pressure Wenger but not quite the sign of a return to form. Holding, Koscielny and Gabriel failed to make a single tackle in the first 60 minutes and stronger sides than Middlesbrough will not be as forgiving.\nSanchez smiling again\nSanchez has cut a frustrated figure at times this season, with reports\n, external\nsuggesting he is keen to leave the Gunners in the summer.\nHowever, his celebrations after Arsenal's goals on Monday did not look like those of an unhappy player.\nHe hugged and high-fived his team-mates and was seen smiling broadly at the final whistle, celebrating with the fans.\nIt is unlikely to be enough to convince Arsenal fans he will stay at the club, but it will no doubt have been pleasing for Wenger.\nIs there hope for Middlesbrough?\nMiddlesbrough are the only side in English league football not to have won a league game during 2017 and that awful run of form has put them perilously close to an immediate return to the Championship.\nPerformances have improved since Steve Agnew replaced Aitor Karanka on a caretaker basis last month and this display was perhaps their best so far under the Englishman.\nBut wins are needed and needed quickly. Five wins and a draw from their final six games would take them to 40 points - generally perceived as the minimum to avoid relegation - but with games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool still to come they need to significantly improve in the final third to have a chance of pulling off an unlikely escape.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\nWhat they said\nMiddlesbrough caretaker boss Steve Agnew: \"We are bitterly disappointed with the result but the players gave everything they had. We couldn't ask more of them.\n\"We played on the front foot, put them under pressure. I felt we might get the second goal after Negredo scored.\n\"The ball just wouldn't drop in the box for us. We put them under tremendous pressure.\"\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We responded well. I think it was not perfect but the commitment and focus was there. At 1-1 we found a response and managed to win.\n\"It was a big test, Middlesbrough gave everything. It's one of their last chances to stay in the league.\n\"It [the top four] is mathematically still alive. We knew we needed to win. Now we have a little break with the FA Cup and then we come back again to the league.\n\"We have to win every game to have a chance to get in the top four, starting tonight. I think it will make the team a bit more serene.\"\nSanchez to outdo Adebayor? The stats\nArsenal picked up only their second win in their past nine away league games (D1 L6), though both victories came against teams currently in the relegation zone (Swansea were beaten 4-0 on 14 January).\nAlexis Sanchez has scored more away goals in the Premier League this season than any other player (13).\nIndeed, only Emmanuel Adebayor (14 in 2007-08) has scored more away goals in a single Premier League campaign for Arsenal than Sanchez this season.\nMiddlesbrough are winless in 15 league games - their longest such run in the division.\nOnly Thierry Henry (12) has scored more direct free-kick goals in the Premier League for Arsenal than Sanchez (five, level with Robin van Persie).\nMesut Ozil has scored in two of his past three league games for Arsenal, the same number he'd scored in in his previous 16.\nOzil also made four tackles, his joint-most in a Premier League game (last doing so against Man City in December 2015).\nArsenal's opener was their 3,000th away goal in English league football (now 3,001) - the second side to reach that figure (Manchester United, 3226).\nWhat next?\nMiddlesbrough continue their search for a first league win of the year on Saturday when they travel to Bournemouth (15:00 BST). Arsenal, meanwhile, now switch their focus to the FA Cup. They face Manchester City in the semi-final on Sunday (15:00)."

        "article_text": "Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough\nMiddlesbrough's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a major setback as they lost heavily at Bournemouth after playing for 70 minutes with 10 men.\nMidfielder Gaston Ramirez was sent off after 20 minutes for two bookable offences - one for diving and another for a reckless challenge on Marc Pugh.\nThey were already trailing 2-0 after Joshua King scored from close range just 96 seconds into the match and Benik Afobe converted from Charlie Daniels' pass.\nMarc Pugh's curling effort made it 3-0 and Daniels added the fourth.\nBoro, 19th in the Premier League, are nine points from safety with just five games remaining.\nRelive the action from the Vitality Stadium\nReaction from Saturday's Premier League games\nReckless Ramirez costs Boro\nMiddlesbrough's relegation could be confirmed as early as next weekend.\nThey entertain Manchester City on 30 April and if they lose that - and results go against Steve Agnew's team between now and then - their return to the Championship after one season will be confirmed.\nBoro needed to win at the Vitality Stadium. Instead, they were embarrassed during a self-inflicted defeat and are now 16 league games without a win.\nPugh was afforded too much space to cross for King to score his 11th Premier League goal in 2017 - five more than Middlesbrough have managed.\nThen Middlesbrough's defence was caught out by Daniels' clever pass for Afobe to double the lead.\nRamirez's red card was inexcusable. The former Southampton player deservedly got a yellow card for diving inside the Cherries' penalty area before needlessly hacking at Pugh.\nMarten de Roon did force a fine save from Artur Boruc, but Bournemouth cruised to three points after the interval.\nPugh marked his 250th league appearances for the Cherries by making it 3-0 after a wonderful pass from Lewis Cook, before Daniels skipped around a couple of challenges and rifled home from 20 yards.\nCherries set for third Premier League season\nBournemouth came into this on the back of a four-match winless run that had raised fears they could be dragged into the end-of-season battle for survival.\nThis win catapulted Eddie Howe's men four places up the table to 12th, seven points above the relegation zone with four games to play.\nOnly a disastrous finish will prevent the Cherries from playing in the top flight for a third successive season.\nThey have 38 points and need another five from four games to surpass last season's tally of 42, which earned them 16th spot.\nAlthough Middlesbrough were poor, Bournemouth turned on the style as they overcame the loss of on-loan midfielder Jack Wilshere for the rest of the campaign to ease to victory.\nMan of the Match - Marc Pugh (Bournemouth)\n'Angry and disappointing'\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"We started very well, in a game of this importance when you score as early as we did it gives you a massive lift.\n\"Our aim was to come out fast and create a high tempo, and it was difficult for Middlesbrough to handle it after the sending-off. We were disciplined and saw the game out well.\n\"It was great to see our fluency with the ball which we didn't have for the last couple of games. It's important you have a philosophy the players believe in.\"\nMiddlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: \"In a way, we lost the game in the first 10 minutes. That's not like us, it was really poor defending. Playing short passes on the edge of the area is why we've been conceding.\n\"We gave ourselves a very difficult afternoon after conceding those two early goals and going down to 10 men against a very good team who score a lot of goals at home.\n\"It was naive defending. There's angry and disappointed players in there but we'll all be in tomorrow morning to address the situation.\"\n'Fastest red card for three years' - the stats\nGaston Ramirez was sent off for two bookable offences after just 20 minutes - the fastest in a Premier League game since Chico Flores for Swansea against Chelsea in April 2014 (16 minutes).\nNo ground has seen more Premier League goals this season than the Vitality Stadium (57, level with Anfield and the Liberty Stadium).\nBournemouth have scored 31 home Premier League goals this season, a number only four sides can better (Tottenham 43, Everton and Liverpool 41, and Chelsea 39).\nMiddlesbrough have failed to score in 10 Premier League away games this season, more than any other side.\nOnly Romelu Lukaku (14) and Harry Kane (12) have scored more Premier League goals in 2017 than Joshua King (11).\nWhat's next?\nSunderland are up next - for both Bournemouth and Middlesbrough. The Cherries visit the Stadium of Light next Saturday (15:00 BST) three days after the Black Cats have visited the Riverside (19:45 BST) for a game between the bottom two."

Edimilson Fernandes threw the ball to the Spaniard, who mis-kicked it before managing to smother it before Kevin Mirallas could pounce.\nWest Ham defender James Collins had had the best chance of the half, heading wide from six yards out.\nIt was the home side who looked most like scoring after the break, but they continually wasted chances as the game petered out.\nToffees' away form a concern\nEverton had the opportunity to go fifth with a win, but their poor away form continued.\nRonald Koeman's side have now won just twice on their travels in their last 13 games.\nAlthough they enjoyed 65.4% of possession in the first half, they touched the ball only twice in the opposition's goalmouth.\nKoeman tried to change things at half-time, sending on Gareth Barry and Ademola Lookman for Tom Davies and Idrissa Gueye.\nIt was 19-year-old Lookman who finally managed a shot for Everton, sending one wide from distance. But his efforts aside, Everton did not trouble the Hammers defence.\nThe big concern will have been the form of Lukaku, who leads the Premier League's scoring chart with 24 goals, but managed just three touches in the Everton box.\nThe one time he did get on the ball in the box he was marshalled brilliantly by Collins and it took until the 85th minute for the Toffees to send in a meaningful cross for him to attack.\nOnly Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, with 17 goals, has scored more often in the top five European leagues than Lukaku in 2017. However, only one of the Belgian's 14 goals this year has come away from home.\nThe point moved Everton into sixth, one point above Arsenal, who have played three games fewer.\nMan of the match - James Collins (West Ham)\n'A lot of negatives'\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \"It was really far from what we are used to, from the first minute to the last second.\n\"We didn't get the intensity. It was a poor performance with a lot of negatives.\n\"One positive is we kept a clean sheet. We like to perform to a certain level and it was far from that.\n\"I wasn't happy at half-time so we tried to do something. I couldn't change four, five, six or seven. But I changed two to give a signal to the team.\n\"We need wins now to get a chance of sixth or fifth place.\"\n'11 lions'\nHammers boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport: \"I am really pleased with the performance, I could not ask any more from my players. In terms of effort, dedication and determination, they get top marks. If any team deserved three points it was us.\n\"To limit them to one chance requires a lot of hard work. The only bit of negativity is that I felt at moments we lacked some quality in our decision-making. We played like 11 lions, one for each other.\n\"We talk about the magic number of 40 [points for Premier League survival]. I think we might need a few more points, so we are not going into the last game [still in danger].\"\nStalemate struggles\nThis was the first Premier League game to finish 0-0 at the London Stadium.\nThis is just the second time that these two sides have drawn 0-0 in the Premier League in 42 meetings - the other coming in March 2003 at Goodison Park.\nEverton failed to find the net for just the second time in their last 17 Premier League games.\nFor the second time this season, Everton have failed to have a shot on target in a Premier League game - a joint-worst record with Middlesbrough.\nThis is the first time in Lukaku's Everton career that he has failed to score against West Ham - having netted in each of his previous nine appearances against the Hammers.\nLukaku failed to have a shot on target in this match - the third successive away game the Belgian striker has failed to do so. It is the longest run without a shot on target away from home in the Premier League.\nAdrian kept his fourth clean sheet of the season; the same number fellow West Ham keeper Darren Randolph has kept but the Spaniard has played 10 games fewer (12 games).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham travel to Stoke on Saturday, while Everton host leaders Chelsea on Sunday, 30 April."

        "article_text": "Hull City 2-0 Watford\nTen-man Hull City claimed a gutsy victory against Watford to ensure they remain outside the relegation zone and in control of their Premier League destiny.\nThe hosts endured a nightmare first half at the KCOM Stadium, the nadir coming when striker Oumar Niasse was shown a controversial straight red for a challenge on M'Baye Niang in the 25th minute.\nMarco Silva's side also saw a decent penalty appeal turned down, but kept their composure in the second period to stun the visitors en route to a fourth straight home league win.\nHull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic was central to the win, tipping over from Sebastian Prodl in the first half and then producing a point-blank save to keep out Etienne Capuoe just a minute before Hull took the lead.\nThe breakthrough came when a quick break ended with Kamil Grosicki crossing for Lazar Markovic to fire in on the rebound after his header came back off the bar.\nSam Clucas made sure of the points with a superb shot from distance, the midfielder controlling 25 yards from goal and firing ferociously beyond the reach of Heurelho Gomes.\nHull have now won 19 points out of a possible 21 at home under Silva and stay two points above the drop zone. Watford remain in 10th place.\nRelive the drama at the KCOM Stadium\nReaction from all of Saturday's games\nCornered Tigers come out fighting\nReferee Bobby Madley's decision to send off Niasse for his challenge on Niang threatened to overshadow the contest.\nThe dismissal came as a shock to the on-loan Everton striker, who undoubtedly caught the Watford midfielder high on the shin pad with a raised boot, although the contact appeared to be light.\nOn the touchline Hull boss Silva was apoplectic, and his mood was not improved by Madley turning down a penalty appeal just before the break when Grosicki was caught from behind by Nordin Amrabat as he shaped to shoot.\nSilva decided against confronting the official at half-time, instead focusing his efforts on things he could control, namely adding bite to his depleted attack by throwing Abel Hernandez into the action in place of Evandro.\nThe change gave the 10 men a better shape, but when the breakthrough came it was their two wingers who combined to superb effect.\nGrosicki's bouncing cross was met with a clever header by Markovic that came down on the line but needed following up by the alert Serb.\nAs long as Hull's lead was just one goal it looked fragile, so when when Clucas unleashed his thunderous effort 19 minutes from time the joy of the moment was matched by a huge sense of relief both on the pitch and in the stands.\nHornets' away-day woes continue\nWatford's failure to punish Hull for Niasse's dismissal continues their poor run on the road, which has been in sharp contrast to their displays at home.\nWalter Mazzarri's men moved on to 40 points - and presumed safety - with their victory over Swansea a week ago, the third time in four home league matches that they have won without conceding.\nBut they have now lost four straight matches on their travels and Mazzarri cut a frustrated figure at the final whistle.\nAlthough Watford showed a willingness to close down when the Tigers had possession, their inability to take the game to the 10 men in the second half prompted captain Troy Deeney to apologise to the travelling fans.\nDeeney said the players \"have a moral obligation to play better\", and added \"We don't play until a week on Monday and it will be a long hard week.\n\"It's just not about this season, it's about next season.\"\nMan of the match - Sam Clucas (Hull City)\n'This is not the first time something like this has happened'\nHull manager Marco Silva: \"Yes I'm really happy. It was not easy. We played with 10 players, but our boys were fantastic and they deserved it.\n\"I'm really happy but we still have four games to fight. Maybe in January no one would believe in our club to survive. I don't know what the future is.\"\nOn Niasse's red card: \"I don't want to talk about this situation and I respect the referee and officials, but this is not the first time that something like this has happened. Today we have achieved what we needed, but it was very hard.\"\nWatford striker Troy Deeney: \"Not good enough. We just thought we could play some tiki-taka football against a team fighting for their lives.\n\"I'm not in the business of apologising, but it's a long journey for our fans and that wasn't good enough, which is why I went over to apologise.\"\nSilva's stunning home record continues - the stats\nSince Marco Silva's arrival, only Everton (21) and Tottenham Hotspur (21) have earned more points at home in the Premier League than Hull City (19).\nIn fact, Silva is unbeaten in his last 41 home league games as a manager (W34 D7 L0), with his last loss coming on 30 March 2014 (Estoril v Rio Ave).\nWatford have seen their opponents have a man sent off in three of the last 10 Premier League games, with Hull receiving three red cards themselves in their last 10.\nHull have claimed 28 points in home games this season, compared to five points away, accounting for 85% of their total (28/33).\nOnly in one previous Premier League campaign have Hull City recorded more wins than the nine they have this season (10 in 2013/14).\nWhat's next?\nHull travel to Southampton on Saturday, 29 April (15:00 BST), while Watford are not in action until Monday, 1 May when they host Liverpool at Vicarage Road (20:00 BST)."

We played terrific. We rode our luck but overall deserved to win and can look forward.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We made it difficult for ourselves. If you are away you have got to make sure you are in the game and don't concede early and that is what we did.\n\"We hadn't got going. At 1-0 for the most part we were OK but clearly the game has changed on missing the penalty - if we could get back on terms, who knows?\n\"We need to be better at managing the game and affecting the opposition.\"\nLlorente a heading expert - the best stats\nThe Swans have won four of their past six home Premier League games, having won just two of their first 11 at the Liberty Stadium this season.\nNo player has scored more headed goals than Fernando Llorente in the Premier League this season (six - level with Romelu Lukaku and Michail Antonio).\nOnly Kevin de Bruyne (13) has more Premier League assists than Gyfli Sigurdsson this season (12 - level with Christian Eriksen), while the Iceland international has provided more from set plays than any other player in the competition (seven).\nStoke have failed to score in six successive away league games for the first time since August 1997 (a run of nine).\nTom Carroll's goal was his first in the Premier League since Boxing Day 2015, when he scored for Spurs in a 3-0 win against Norwich.\nPaul Clement has the best win percentage of any Swansea manager in the Premier League (40% - six wins from 15 games).\nWhat's next?\nStoke host West Ham on Saturday 29 April (15:00 BST kick-off) while Swansea travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United on Sunday 30 April (12:00 BST kick-off)."

It is the longest unbeaten run by a Premier League team within a single season since 2010-11, when they went 24 games without losing.\nBurnley failed to land a shot on target in a Premier League home game for only the second time in their history.\nOnly Alan Shearer (190) has scored in more different Premier League games than Wayne Rooney (149 - level with Frank Lampard and Andy Cole).\nAnthony Martial has both scored and assisted in a Premier League away game for the first time in his career.\nAnder Herrera has provided six assists in the Premier League this term, as many as in his previous two campaigns combined.\nMan of the match - Anthony Martial (Manchester United)\nManager reaction\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"I'm very happy. It's not easy to win here and it's even harder to be in control and we were in control for 90 minutes.\n\"We understood the way they play and we played against their strengths. I think it was a great result that we deserved.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"They are very strong, tactically, technically and with game knowledge. We huffed and puffed and stuck at it. They scored two poor goals from our point of view, we have to make a foul on the first one.\n\"I am pleased with the mentality of the second half. They killed the game. That is the reality of playing some of the top sides. You can't always get above where you are.\"\nWhat's next?\nBurnley travel to Crystal Palace in the late kick-off next Saturday (17:30 BST) while Manchester United make the cross-city trip to Manchester City on Thursday (20:00 BST)"

        "article_text": "Liverpool 1-2 Crystal Palace\nChristian Benteke came back to haunt his former club as Crystal Palace beat Liverpool at Anfield to take a giant stride towards Premier League survival and dent their opponents' top-four aspirations.\nBenteke scored in either half as Sam Allardyce's Eagles mounted a brilliant fightback after Liverpool took the lead through Philippe Coutinho's fine free-kick.\nLiverpool sold Benteke to Palace last summer for \u00a35m less than they paid for the Belgium striker a year earlier, but it was his burly presence in the final third that proved the difference in an entertaining contest.\nHis first was a well-taken strike high into the net from Yohan Cabaye's low cross, his second a poacher's header from six yards after some lax Liverpool defending at a corner.\nPalace - who also earned a brilliant win at leaders Chelsea on 1 April - have won six of their last eight league games to move on to 38 points, seven clear of danger and are all but assured of another season of top-flight football.\nThey have now triumphed on their last three league visits to Anfield - the first team to achieve that feat since Chelsea in October 2005.\nJurgen Klopp's Reds stay in third place, but they have played two games more than both Manchester City in fourth place and fifth-placed Manchester United, who are two and three points back respectively.\nAllardyce 'breathing easier' after victory\nRelive the action from Anfield\nLaboured Liverpool lack cutting edge\nOn a day when one of their former players put on a striking masterclass, Liverpool's shortcomings in front of goal will be acutely felt.\nKlopp's side racked up 72% possession, but just one shot on target in more than 90 minutes of play was scant return on that perceived dominance.\nCoutinho's brilliant 30-yard strike aside, Wayne Hennessey in the Palace goal had few scares, with the players in front of him performing superbly, particularly when they were called on to crowd out Coutinho when the Brazilian threatened to weave a path to goal in the second half.\nA woeful mis-hit by Emre Can after good approach work by James Milner and Roberto Firmino summed up Liverpool's performance in the final third, and their manager conceded they had been guilty of failing to make the most of their possession.\n\"We dominated the game,\" Klopp said. \"You have to be ready for the one moment. In the second half we had a really good period when everything was OK apart from the goal.\n\"We did a lot of good things but we could not finalise it. That's the most important thing in football.\"\nEagles soaring to safety\nTo say Anfield has become a happy hunting ground for Palace in recent years would be something of an understatement.\nPalace were famously thumped 9-0 in the league there in 1989, but those days are now long gone, with the club from south-east London enjoying a sequence of three straight wins at the famous old ground.\nThey spoiled Steven Gerrard's Liverpool farewell with their first win in 2015, while the following season they inflicted a first defeat for Klopp in his seventh game at the helm.\nThis latest win was perhaps in part down to the confidence gleaned from those performances, as well as a superb run of form during April that also brought a one-sided win over Arsenal at Selhurst Park.\nPalace had just seven shots on goal and three on target - but that was all they needed.\nWhat chances they created were far more clear-cut than those of their opponents, and in Benteke they had the perfect target man to finish off the job.\nMan of the match - Christian Benteke (Crystal Palace)\nAllardyce wins at Anfield at 14th attempt - stats\nLiverpool lost at home in the Premier League after opening the scoring for the first time since May 2015, also against Crystal Palace (1-3).\nSam Allardyce won his first Premier League match at Anfield as a manager, in what was his 14th attempt with the fifth different club.\nAllardyce has now guided the Eagles to seven league wins in 2017 - one more than they managed under predecessor Alan Pardew in the whole of 2016.\nSince Philippe Coutinho made his Premier League debut in February 2013, only Yaya Toure (14) has scored more goals from outside the box than the Brazilian (13).\nCoutinho is the fifth Brazilian player to score 10 or more goals in a single Premier League season after Gilberto Silva, Juninho, Robinho and team-mate Roberto Firmino.\nChristian Benteke has scored five goals in his previous three Premier League games at Anfield as an opposition player - at no away venue has he scored more in the competition (five).\nBenteke (11) is one of only four players to register 10 or more away goals in the Premier League this term (Alexis Sanchez 13, Sergio Aguero 12 and Zlatan Ibrahimovic 10).\nNo Premier League side has conceded more direct free-kick goals this season than Crystal Palace (three - level with Everton).\n'We have to squeeze everything out of this season'\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I have no idea how Crystal Palace are in the situation they are. We knew it was difficult. We were dominant, you cannot create 20 chances in a game like this, you have to work and that is what we did.\n\"We scored a fantastic goal and more interesting situations and then out of nothing let them score. After you could see their confidence grew and in the second half we were dominant.\n\"They had counter-attack threat but again out of nothing we gave them an opportunity from a corner. The decisive one we missed the ball at the front post.\n\"It is frustrating, disappointing of course. Everyone thinks the Champions League has slipped through our fingers but we have one more month to stay positive. We have to try everything to squeeze everything out of this season.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"Some goals you can't stop and that one we couldn't stop. But the recovery from that is good. Out of possession we frustrated Liverpool today so much that they had little opportunity to have a clean shot on goal.\n\"Liverpool were only as good as we allowed them to be. They had a lot of possession as did Chelsea and Arsenal. We did more with our possession than Liverpool and that is why we won.\n\"We finished our analysis with how many goals Liverpool have conceded from corners. We showed that it might not be the first ball in but the second or third if we make runs in the right areas.\n\"It has been hard work but we are looking up. We have five games to go but Tottenham on Wednesday will come too early. We will have to change the side to get fresh legs into the side. It is a big result today, it makes life so much easier.\"\nWhat's next?\nPalace do not have long to prepare for their next match with Tottenham, who visit Selhurst Park on Wednesday (20:00 BST). For Liverpool, the wait is far longer as they travel to Watford on Monday, 1 May (20:00 BST)."

Suddenly the pressure was on Conte and his players.\nThe tables have now been turned and it will be Spurs and their manager who will be feeling the heat and the need to win when they travel to in-form Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nSpurs have reeled off seven straight league wins - their best sequence since 1967 - but all the self-belief built up during that run will be required to face Sam Allardyce's rejuvenated side, who have beaten Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool in recent weeks.\nThey will not only have to respond to the Blues' win that restored their seven-point lead, but also to the disappointment of losing the FA Cup semi-final to their London rivals at Wembley on Saturday.\nThese are defining moments in the Premier League season - with a huge weekend ahead as Chelsea travel to Everton and Spurs face Arsenal in the north London derby on Sunday.\nMan of the match - Diego Costa (Chelsea)\nHazard's best return - the match stats\nCosta's first strike was his 50th in the Premier League in his 85th game - only seven strikers have reached the milestone faster.\nHazard has scored 15 league goals this season - his best return in a single campaign in the competition.\nSince their return to the top-flight in 2012-13, Southampton have scored more away Premier League goals at Stamford Bridge than any other side (nine).\nFabregas' assist for Costa's goal was his 103rd in the Premier League - second only to Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs (162).\nCahill has scored 26 Premier League goals - excluding penalties - the second most of any defender in the competition (after team-mate John Terry with 40).\nSaints conceded four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since 5 April 2014, when they lost 4-1 at eventual champions Manchester City.\nThe Blues have now failed to keep a clean sheet in their past 11 Premier League games.\nWhat's next?\nThe Blues are at Goodison Park to face Everton on Sunday (14:05 BST) and the Saints will be at home to struggling Hull on Saturday (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Arsenal 1-0 Leicester City\nArsenal kept up their top-four chase as a late Robert Huth own goal gave them victory against a stubborn Leicester side.\nThe home supporters at Emirates Stadium seemed set for a deflating evening before Nacho Monreal's shot found the bottom corner via the German defender's chest four minutes from time.\nAlexis Sanchez had rattled the bar and been denied by Huth's last-ditch challenge in the Gunners' best chances before the goal.\nBut Leicester also threatened, with Riyad Mahrez bringing a superb save out of Petr Cech in the first half, and then had furious penalty appeals turned down at the death.\nRelive the night's Premier League action\nArsenal are now three points behind Manchester United and four behind fourth-placed Manchester City having played the same number of games - at least one of the Manchester pair will drop points when they meet on Thursday.\nLiverpool, in third, are six points ahead of the Londoners having played two more games.\nArsenal walking the top-four tightrope\nBefore the match Gunners boss Arsene Wenger insisted that qualifying for a 20th successive season of Champions League football was still possible, but dependent on a \"perfect run-in\".\nThis was the first step on perilous tightrope walk that includes the north London derby against Tottenham on Sunday and meetings with Manchester United and Everton in their remaining six games.\nThere is little room for error and few in the Emirates initially seemed to have confidence in their team delivering the sprint finish necessary.\nA patchy attendance - officially numbered at 59,829 - produced a lukewarm atmosphere in the first half, most notable for Leicester fans' appeals for Wenger to stay in his job after his contract expires at the end of the season.\nThe decisive strike, combined with a late incident in which Christian Fuchs launched a throw-in into Sanchez's shoulder from close range - prompting the Chilean to fall down clutching his face - raised the temperature towards the end.\nBut Arsenal will need to play better over the rest of their campaign to pull off an improbable late surge into the Champions League places.\nMore immediately, defeat by Tottenham on Sunday will ensure their local rivals finish above them in the table for the first time since 1994-95 season.\nVardy sees what might have been\nJamie Vardy may have ended up on the losing side, but the match exemplified why the Leicester striker turned down the chance to move to Arsenal in the summer.\nLast season's Premier League top-scorer has scored seven goals in 11 games since Craig Shakespeare took over and revived the spirit of that Foxes title-winning season and his searing pace and instinctive play suited the visitors counter-attacking gameplan.\nHe chased hard up front on his own and almost beat Cech with a snap-shot from Marc Albrighton's pull-back in one of his side's few chances.\nFaced with the deep-lying defences that Arsenal often come up against and the Gunners' intricate build-up play, the 30-year-old would have had to make major changes to his game to fit in.\nSpite and spice in the final minutes\nWhile the exchange between Fuchs and Sanchez provided a moment of pantomime towards the end, Yohan Benalouane's foul on Olivier Giroud was a more malicious matter.\nThe Leicester defender planted his studs into the base of Giroud's back as the pair contest a header late on.\nSeveral Arsenal players surrounded referee Mike Jones demanding more than the yellow card shown and, given replays appeared to show Benalouane checking Giroud's whereabouts before launching into the challenge, it could easily have been red.\nMan of the match - Nacho Monreal\n21 and counting... the key match stats\nArsenal extended their unbeaten run over Leicester in the Premier League to 21 games. They have not lost since their very first meeting in November 1994.\nThe victory saw the Gunners equal their longest home winning streak against a single opponent - 10 successive wins against Everton between January 1997 and September 2005.\nArsenal have now scored 29 league goals in the final 30 minutes of games in the Premier League this season, the most of any side.\nFor Leicester, meanwhile, this was the first time they have failed to score in a Premier League game under Craig Shakespeare - they had done so at least twice in each of the previous seven.\nWhat they said:\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"Every win gives you a little more momentum. I don't have a preference for the Manchester derby, we don't have to look much at the others. We just have to look after ourselves. The target is clear for us.\n\"Leicester were hard to break down, but we were patient and did not give away any chances.\"\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare: \"We showed resilience in our defending, but we have not got any points on the board to show for it. We restricted them and were cruelly beaten by a deflected shot. We have got a dejected dressing room in there.\n\"We have not got enough points yet and we need to put more on the board.\"\nWhat's next\nArsenal take on north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday at 16:30 BST. Leicester travel to West Brom in the league on the day before."

However, in a tepid game where both sides struggled for rhythm, the Black Cats could not keep the pressure on for long.\nThe boos the Sunderland players walked off to at half-time were amplified come the end of the match, with fans chanting \"you're not fit to wear the shirt\".\nBoro tough it out for rare win\nMiddlesbrough have struggled at home this season and prior to this match had scored just 13 goals at the Riverside - the lowest of any top-flight team.\nThey have also played out seven goalless draws, underlining their lack of threat in the final third.\nSo it was perhaps no surprise they needed to profit from their opponents' carelessness to score the only goal of the game, with the unmarked De Roon sneaking in between Jones and John O'Shea before sliding the ball through Pickford's legs.\nBoro looked vulnerable after going in front, with Sunderland given too much space inside the area, leading to a number of scrambled clearances.\nThe hosts held on, though, to end manager Steve Agnew's winless streak since taking over from the sacked Aitor Karanka in March.\nThe result also meant Boro striker Rudy Gestede, brought on as a late substitute, finally ended a Premier League-record run of 43 games without a win.\nMan of the match - Marten de Roon (Middlesbrough)\nBoro do the double - stats\nMiddlesbrough have completed a league double over the Black Cats for the first time since the 2002/03 season.\nMarten de Roon has scored twice in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 26 combined.\nDe Roon's goal was Middlesbrough's first shot of the match.\nIt was Middlesbrough's first Premier League goal inside the opening 10 minutes at the Riverside since a Tuncay Sanli strike in the third minute against Hull in April 2009.\nAlthough they were beaten, Sunderland had more shots than an opponent in an away Premier League game for the first time since April 2016 against Stoke.\nSunderland have now failed to score in 17 Premier League games this season, more than any other side.\n'While there's a chance, we will keep going'\nSunderland manager David Moyes: \"I've never been in this position before so it's new to me. It's something I'm not enjoying.\n\"We didn't get a good result but I thought we played well. It was a poor goal that we gave away but I can't fault the players or their efforts. We tried to build play up, make opportunities, but I wasn't disappointed with the performance.\n\"While there's a chance, we'll keep going. Good performances lead to results, that's the way it goes. I think we've had a couple of pretty good performances in the last few games.\n\"We know our position, we're not daft, we know exactly where we are. We have to try and pick up every win.\"\nMiddlesbrough manager Steve Agnew: \"It feels great. Everybody is absolutely delighted with the three points. We had to defend for long spells but we got the goal early. I'm so proud of the players.\n\"Clean sheets are obviously something you build on. I think it was important, the early goal. It gave everybody a lift and a confidence to see the game through.\n\"The players are all happy. I think all we do now is we remain focused for the game on Sunday against Manchester City.

As time went on it looked more and more likely that victory would elude them but to their credit they stayed patient before a moment of magic from Eriksen finally unlocked the Palace defence.\nThe forward took full advantage of a moment when he was afforded a rare bit of space, shooting from distance beyond the reach of Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey.\nIt was not a classic performance by a Tottenham side that has scored at least three goals in each of their last three Premier League games but it was one that showed they have the ability to dig in and grind out a result - a side of their game that could prove crucial in the title run in.\nShould Spurs have been down to 10 men?\nIt could have been a different game if Tottenham lost Victor Wanyama to a second booking in the first half.\nAfter picking up an early yellow card for a bad foul, the midfielder slid in late on Andros Townsend. Referee Jon Moss took Wanyama to one side, but let him off with a warning.\nPochettino opted to withdraw Wanyama at half time, but Palace boss Sam Allardyce felt he should never have had the option to do that in the first place.\n\"Jon Moss should have sent him off,\" said Allardyce. \"The second challenge was probably more of a booking than the first one.\n\"It is disappointing for us, it is a mistake but at the end of the day we lost a game and we can only think about ourselves right now.\"\nSakho blow for Palace\nSakho has been a key player in Palace's upturn in form, with every performance since the defender's January arrival on loan from Liverpool serving only to enhance his transfer value.\nAgainst Tottenham he was once again excellent, keeping the attacking talent of Kane, Alli and Eriksen quiet throughout the first half.\nOne moment in particular stood out when, under pressure from Kane, he coolly chested the ball down inside his own area before calmly clearing, prompting home fans to chant \"sign him up, sign him up\".\nBut they must now face up to the possibility of Sakho being absent from the Palace backline after he suffered what looked like a bad injury early in the second half, falling awkwardly following a challenge.\nAllardyce's side are unlikely to go down thanks to an incredible run of just two defeats in their last nine Premier League games but Palace fans will be hopeful of seeing Sakho in a Palace shirt again this season.\nWhat they said\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"Outstanding team effort by the players, who have had less time to recover against an exceptionally good side.\n\"Our application was outstanding and we gave Tottenham a hell of a game in the first half, nip and tuck, but of course it would happen that we would tire given the lack of recovery time compared to Tottenham.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was unbelievable. Very good performance. I think second half we played much better than in the first half. It was difficult in the first half for us to move the ball and find the space but we changed the shape at half time and it was more fluid, we started to find the space and started to push Palace deeper and deeper.\n\"It was good to get the three points and be alive in the race for the title. The challenge is to keep going. It is always better to win but it is true [the Arsenal game] is a big derby, perhaps the last at White Hart Lane and I think it will be an exciting game.\"\nEight in a row for Spurs - the stats\nSpurs have won eight consecutive league games for the first time since October 1960 (13 in a row).\nCrystal Palace have lost four successive league games against Spurs in the top-flight for the first time since September 1971 (five in a row).\nChristian Eriksen has had a hand in 16 goals in his last 12 games in all competitions for Tottenham (5 goals, 11 assists).\nSince his debut in September 2013, Christian Eriksen has scored more Premier League goals from outside the box than any other player (14).\nSpurs became the third Premier League side to score 100+ goals in all competitions this season after Man City (105) and Arsenal (106).\nMousa Dembele became the fourth Belgian player to reach 200 appearances in the Premier League alongside Vincent Kompany, Marouane Fellaini and Simon Mignolet.\nCrystal Palace have lost seven of their last eight Premier League London derbies on home soil (W1).\nWhat next?\nIt's the big one for Tottenham on Sunday as they host fierce rivals Arsenal in the Premier League (16:30 BST).

The Brazilian, signed last year but unable to play until January, was making his first appearance since he was injured playing against Bournemouth on 13 February.\nKompany back to his best\nVincent Kompany's return to form and fitness has been massive bonus for Manchester City and Guardiola - and the 31-year-old who has captained the club to two Premier League titles looked back to his imperious best against Manchester United.\nKompany gives City's defence added power and assurance, as well as leadership, and illustrated again how much he has been missed as he has battled a succession of injuries.\nHe played only 33 games in 2014-15 and 22 last season, a total that included only 14 league matches, and this was only his 10th appearance this term as the campaign moves into May.\nThis was the first time in more than a year Kompany has put together a sequence of three successive games and came after a tough 120 minutes in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal at Wembley.\nKompany is providing quality for the present and may also give Guardiola food for thought when he makes his summer transfer plans, which are almost certain to include a move for another central defender, with Southampton's Virgil van Dijk and Burnley's Michael Keane among those linked with a switch to Etihad Stadium.\nUnited see red again - the stats\nSeven of the eight red cards given in this Premier League fixture have been to Manchester United players.\nSergio Aguero attempted nine shots in this match. The last player to attempt more in a competitive game against the Red Devils was Cristiano Ronaldo (11) for Real Madrid in a Champions League match back in March 2013.\nThis equals the most shots that Aguero has attempted in a Premier League game without scoring (9) - level with his appearance versus West Brom in March 2015.\nThe two occasions that Manchester United have allowed their opponents the most shots in a Premier League game this season have both been against Man City (18 at Old Trafford and 19 tonight).\nUnited have equalled their record for the longest unbeaten run within a single top-flight season - 24 games, level with 2010-11.\nCity have now failed to score in four of their last five Manchester derbies in all competitions.\nWhat's next?\nManchester City will climb above Liverpool, who don't play until Monday, if they win at relegation-threatened Middlesbrough on Sunday (14:05 BST), while Manchester United host struggling Swansea City at Old Trafford on the same day (12:00 BST)."

We achieved all these things,\" Silva told BBC Sport.\n\"We knew before it would be really difficult for us but we had a very good performance, the first half was really very good - we controlled the game.\"\nRelive the action at St Mary's\nReaction as Sunderland are relegated\nThough Hull were on top for long periods, the late drama provided an unexpected finish to an otherwise uninspiring game.\nKamil Grosicki went closest for the visitors as he hit the post with a free-kick on six minutes, while Oumar Niasse missed two late chances.\nBut Hull's real strength lay in their defence, with Harry Maguire making several crucial blocks.\nThe Tigers have won 19 of their 21 points under Silva at home, and host relegated Sunderland at the KCOM Stadium next weekend.\n\"It is one more final for us,\" said Silva. \"We play always with risk and big pressure - for me it is normal and I want to players to get used to it and enjoy it.\n\"We respect Sunderland and we need to work hard to win the game.\"\nHull resolute on the road at last\nUntil N'Diaye's ill-advised tussle with Yoshida resulted in the spot-kick, Hull were excellent in defence, rarely making an error.\nThe defensive organisation Silva has brought to his side has been more evident at home, but a team that had leaked 41 away goals prior to this game finally showed nous on the road too.\nTheir gritty display was epitomised by a towering performance from captain Maguire, who made excellent tackles on Sofiane Boufal and Tadic to help limit Southampton to just two shots on target.\nHull only had one shot on target themselves, and away goals remain an issue for a side who have scored only nine all season - fewer than any other Premier League side.\nNiasse should have scored the 10th but missed two good chances either side of Jakupovic's penalty save - blasting high over the bar when unmarked before producing a tame effort from Grosicki's corner that was easily blocked on the line by Cedric Soares.\nA winner would have taken Hull five points clear, but a point increases the pressure on 18th-placed Swansea before their trip to Manchester United on Sunday.\nMan of the match - Eldin Jakupovic (Hull City)\nSick of home Saints\nThere was a smattering of boos directed at the departing Saints players at half-time as the home crowd aired their frustration at a side that once again lacked creativity in front of goal.\nJakupovic's save means Southampton have gone goalless in three of their past four home games, having scored just 17 times at St Mary's all season, with only relegated Sunderland (16) and all-but-doomed Middlesbrough (14) scoring fewer.\nManolo Gabbiadini was kept quiet by compatriot Andrea Ranocchia, while record signing Boufal again struggled as both were withdrawn in a double change for Josh Sims and Shane Long.\nThat injection of youth and pace failed to inspire Southampton, as they resorted to firing efforts high and wide of the Hull goal.\nNinth-placed Saints, however, can again secure a top-half finish despite the sale of key players and the long-standing injury to standout centre-back Virgil van Dijk.\nBut, with three of their five remaining games coming at home - including the visits of top-four chasing Manchester United and Arsenal, Puel needs to find a quick remedy to prevent them sliding down the table.\n'We were poor' - Puel\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel: \"We could've won this game but we could've lost it also with their last corner.\n\"I don't know if we deserved to win because there wasn't enough from us - it was poor play and we have to accept this, we have to do better.\n\"It was not enough against an organised, strong defensive unit - the quality was not enough and I agree with the fans [that showed their disappointment].\"\nHull break unwanted penalty record - match stats\nHull picked up only their second point on the road under Marco Silva in the top flight this season (eight away games played).\nSouthampton have had only two victories in their past eight Premier League home games (D2 L4).\nNo team has failed to score in as many away games as Hull in the Premier League this season (10, same as Middlesbrough and Sunderland).\nJakupovic registered his second penalty save of the season in the Premier League, no other keeper has more.\nThe Tigers have conceded a league-high 12 penalties this season, with 10 of them successfully converted by their opponents.\nIndeed, those 12 penalties are the most conceded by any team in a single Premier League campaign.\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton travel to Liverpool on Sunday, 7 May, with kick-off at 13:30 BST.

You give him a chance and he scores.\n\"We had opportunities and we played some good football, with 16 efforts on goal. They've had one chance and Vardy stuck it away.\n\"We know where we are and what we're doing. The players are running around, it's not as if they've packed it in. We need a break.\n\"Everybody at this football club has given everything this year. They are a good group of players and they work really hard.\"\nLeicester manager Craig Shakespeare: \"I am pleased with our performance.\n\"We had to show different aspects of it today - we had to defend. It was a gutsy performance.\n\"The fans have stuck behind us and I'm pleased they can reap the rewards tonight.\n\"It will be a difficult end to the season and we have to try and win every game we can.\n\"I want Jamie Vardy to finish on a high. He's scored quite a few of late and we need that to continue.\"\nLeicester love The Hawthorns - stats you need to know\nLeicester have won their past three Premier League away games against West Brom, their joint-longest away winning streak at a club in the competition (also vs Liverpool and Manchester City).\nVardy has now scored in all three of his Premier League appearances at The Hawthorns (three goals).\nPulis' side have lost three consecutive home league games for the first time in almost exactly a year - last doing so on 30 April 2016.\nThe Foxes have won 50% of their league games this season when both Vardy and Shinji Okazaki have started (7/14) compared to just 20% when they have not (4/20).\nWhat's next?\nWest Brom travel to Burnley on 6 May (15:00 BST) before a tricky run of games in which they host Chelsea and visit Manchester City.\nLeicester take on Watford at the King Power Stadium on 6 May before a similarly difficult run-in, in which they have to travel to Manchester City before welcoming title-chasers Tottenham."

I'm pleased to be able to contribute and keep a clean sheet,\" he said.\n\"The fans have been incredible throughout the last 13 months and supported me.

We needed to work hard today and try to break down a resolute West Ham team. They made it difficult for Everton last weekend and they made it difficult for us today. Sometimes you have to acknowledge the job that the opposition has done.\n\"We just needed that one moment to convert a chance and open the game up, but credit to West Ham. In the past couple of games they've struck on something that looks to be working for them.\n\"It's a season that has, at times, frustrated us and we've still got games to go and are trying to get a fourth top-10 finish, which this club hasn't done in the past.\"\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"We defended as a team and limited them to a couple of chances.

We played well for long parts. We had four or five good opportunities and did a good job.\n\"We're all disappointed and I feel more for the supporters. We take collective responsibility from top to bottom.\n\"We'll dust ourselves down and see what we have to do.\n\"I don't know what words you can say to the players. I told them they fought for the jersey. Because of that it's difficult to fault them.\n\"We're disappointed with the level of performance all season. We'll do everything we can to get it right.\"\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It was a scrappy game from our perspective. I wasn't happy with the way we played but happy with the result.\n\"Josh King has worked incredibly hard and shows great attitude every day. Technically he is a great player and it is nice to see him score.\n\"The second season is harder, having gone through it. The first season is a novelty, in the second there is expectation.\n\"It's a real achievement to get 40 points.\"\nMan of the match - Joshua King\nSunderland's goalless record - the best stats\nSince their last promotion to the Premier League in 2007, Sunderland have failed to score in 139 top-flight matches - at least 25 more than any other side in that time.\nThe Black Cats have failed to score in 11 of their past 13 Premier League games.\nJosh King scored his 15th Premier League goal of the season - only the second Norwegian to reach this number in a single campaign after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 1996-97 and 2001-02.\nThe Cherries won their first away league game of 2017, last winning on the road at Swansea on 31 December.\nWhat's next?\nWith nothing but pride to play for, Sunderland travel to Hull on Saturday, 6 May (15:00 BST) while Bournemouth host Stoke at the same time."

They have been magnificent this year. If Conte doesn't get that manager of the year award, he probably will because Chelsea are going to win the league, but if he doesn't then Sean Dyche and Eddie Howe shouldn't be far away. When you consider the jobs they are doing with the budget and the size of the clubs, it's a superb job they're doing.\nMan of the match - Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\nPalace boss possession - the stats you need to know\nBurnley are the last Premier League side to secure an away win this season, at the 18th time of asking.\nAfter a run of three consecutive home league wins, Palace have failed to win any of their past three at Selhurst Park, with a draw followed by consecutive defeats.\nThe Clarets registered their first top-flight win in London since January 1975 (1-0 v QPR).\nPalace had 63.6% possession, their second-highest in a top-flight game this season (after 65.7% v Sunderland in February, a game they lost 4-0).\nThe Eagles' four best possession figures this season in the Premier League have all ended in defeat (also 1-0 v West Brom in August and 3-2 v Burnley in November).\nBarnes has scored six Premier League goals this season in his 25 appearances, one more than in the Clarets' last top-flight season (five), when he played 35 games.\nStephen Ward registered his first Premier League assist for Burnley, and his first in the competition since May 2012 for Wolves v Wigan.\nGray netted his first goal in his past eight Premier League games, after scoring seven in the 10 before that.\n'Our destiny is still in our hands'\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"We got nervous. We started very well, but then fell foul to our inefficiencies, not clearing the box and that goal got the nerves jangling.\n\"We sorted that at half-time and hoped our constant pressure would get us back into the game. We made a good recovery but could not find a way through a side who defended well and took their chances.\n\"We have worked very hard to keep our destiny in our own hands. Burnley have had a full week to prepare and I think that showed today.\"\n\"We have got Manchester City next up, then Hull who are in and around us in the table. We have to get it right.\"\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We have had our fair share of critics on the road in the Premier League and I understand why, but we showed our hunger today.\n\"We won the one v one battles, which we knew we would have to do against a team who are on a roll. I thought Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes were magnificent, holding the ball up and putting a real shift in.\n\"We will keep going. That is my mentality, just keep going until the end of the season and then see where we are.\"\nWhat's next?\nCrystal Palace travel to Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City on Saturday, 6 May (12:30 BST) while Burnley host West Brom on the same day (15:00 BST)."

        "article_text": "Manchester United 1-1 Swansea City\nA wonderful Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick earned Swansea a precious point in their battle for Premier League survival and damaged Manchester United's push for the top four.\nSigurdsson curled over the wall from about 20 yards to cancel out Wayne Rooney's penalty and move the Swans to within two points of 17th-placed Hull.\nUnited stay fifth, a point behind both Manchester City and Liverpool after the same number of games.\nThe disappointment of the dropped points was compounded by the loss of both Eric Bailly and Luke Shaw to injuries, joining a list that already includes fellow defenders Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo.\nBut the result was probably fair on Swansea, who had every reason to claim Marcus Rashford dived for the penalty that Rooney converted.\nSuper Sigurdsson saves Swans\nSwansea were the better side for much of the first half, enjoying the majority of possession as a sluggish United had to rely on David de Gea to make smart saves from Fernando Llorente and Jordan Ayew.\nThe visitors looked to have been deflated by the controversial penalty on the stroke of half-time, but were rejuvenated by the introduction of Leroy Fer on the hour mark.\nListen: 5 live football daily podcast - Spurs dominate Arsenal\nThey got what they deserved through the brilliance of Sigurdsson, and after a bizarre build-up to a central free-kick just outside the United penalty area.\nAs the Icelander waited, Ander Herrera dropped from the United wall to goalline, only to be waved away by De Gea. Sigurdsson duly placed the ball exactly where Herrera had been standing.\nSwansea could even have won it, another free-kick from Sigurdsson not converted by Llorente, who was unmarked inside the six-yard box.\nAnother draw hits United hopes\nUnited, playing their ninth game in 30 days, were disorganised at the back and disjointed going forward in the first half, only threatening through the pace of Anthony Martial.\nRashford was visibly frustrated before his telling contribution. Played through on the left of the six-yard box, he was going to ground before the challenge of Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski.\nAfter Rooney coolly converted, United improved and could have doubled their lead in the second half - the captain's goalbound effort from the edge of the six-yard box struck the back of Martial.\nBut, after Bailly was forced from the field, the home side began to unravel, resulting in Sigurdsson's equaliser.\nThough Antonio Valencia forced Fabianski to save a driven shot, United were left to hang on to their 10th home draw of the season.\nThat they set a new club record of 25 successive unbeaten games in a single top-flight season will be of no consolation.\nYet more injuries for United\nUnited can also reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League, but their squad looks set to be further stretched before Thursday's semi-final first leg at Spanish side Celta Vigo.\nLeft-back Shaw, who has only completed four Premier League games this season, had to be substituted after eight minutes with what appeared to be a lower left leg injury.\nUnited boss Jose Mourinho has previously been critical of the England international and said after the match: \"I think Luke Shaw's must be a big injury, because to leave the pitch after 10 minutes I am expecting a very big injury.\"\nBailly then had to be replaced on 60 minutes after injuring his ankle in a challenge with Llorente, prompting Mourinho to begin his own fake warm-up on the touchline.\n\"At the moment, we can walk from the bed to the toilet and break a leg,\" he said.\nUnited were at least boosted by Juan Mata's return to the bench. The Spanish midfielder was feared to be out for the season after groin surgery.\nWhat's next?\nUnited travel to Spain for Thursday's Europa League semi-final first leg against Celta Vigo. Their next Premier League match is at Arsenal on Sunday.\nOf their remaining three games, Swansea face perhaps their sternest test on Saturday, when Everton visit south Wales.\n'We lost players and we lost points'\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"We lost players and we lost points, so today was a bad day.\n\"We did not look tired and exhausted, we are tired and exhausted. You cannot isolate the performance out of context.\n\"This is the ninth match of April, it is not human. We have a squad of 22 that is reduced to 13 or 14 players. The players are very tired.\"\nSwansea City manager Paul Clement: \"My players clearly thought it wasn't a penalty, and seeing the replay the player [Marcus Rashford] has deceived the referee. It's clear. There's no other way to look at it.\n\"The ref seemed to have some doubts because there was a big delay and I spoke to him afterwards and he said he was only receiving confirmation from his assistants. It was a mistake. He went down way before there was contact.\n\"It's still very tight at the bottom. We are just concentrating on doing the best we can. Our form over the past two games has been good, we have to keep this going until the very last game of the season.\"\nGolden Gylfi - the stats\nManchester United have set a new club record for the longest unbeaten run within a single top-flight season (25 games, W13 D12).\nUnited have reached double figures for home league draws for only the second time in their history (11 in 1980-81).\nRooney has had a hand in seven goals in his past seven Premier League appearances against Swansea (three goals, four assists).\nRooney is the first United player to score 20 Premier League penalties for the club.\nSigurdsson has been directly involved in 21 of Swansea's 40 Premier League goals this season (nine goals, 12 assists).\nSigurdsson has become the first player to score in three consecutive Premier League away appearances at Old Trafford since Sergio Aguero in April 2015.\nThe Icelandic midfielder has scored more direct free-kick goals since the start of 2014-15 than any other player (six)."

        "article_text": "Everton 0-3 Chelsea\nPremier League leaders Chelsea took a big step towards clinching the title as three second-half goals saw them overcome Everton at Goodison Park.\nPedro's 25-yard stunner, Gary Cahill's close-range finish and Willian's tap-in kept Antonio Conte's side four points clear of second-placed Tottenham, who beat Arsenal 2-0 later on Sunday.\nIt means the Blues could drop three points in their remaining four games and still claim a second title in three years, even if Spurs win all of their remaining fixtures.\nChelsea had to be patient, with Pedro's left-footed, long-range strike not coming until the 66th minute.\nCahill sealed the win when Maarten Stekelenburg parried Eden Hazard's free-kick onto the onrushing defender, before Willian slotted home from Cesc Fabregas' cutback.\nI know I am an animal - Conte\nRelive Sunday's Premier League action\nListen: 5 live football daily podcast - Spurs dominate Arsenal\nEverton had started brightly in a game that opened at breakneck speed, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin going closest to scoring when he struck the post from a tight angle.\nManchester City's draw at Middlesbrough means Ronald Koeman's side, in seventh, are eight points adrift of the top four with three games left.\nThe day the title was won?\nThis may have been Tottenham's strongest hope of Chelsea surrendering points in their run-in, with Everton placed higher than any of their four remaining opponents, and three home games on the horizon for the Blues.\nIt could prove to be the killer blow to Spurs' spirited challenge, and seems to answer the question of whether Chelsea can handle the growing pressure applied by their London rivals' nine-game winning run in the league.\nThe maths are simple for Chelsea - win three more games and they will be Premier League champions for the sixth time.\nAnd the celebrations from Conte and his players at the final whistle suggested the Blues feel they can get over the line in games against Middlesbrough, West Brom, Watford and Sunderland.\nAdd an FA Cup final win against Arsenal on 27 May and Conte would have had a remarkable first season in English football.\nAn opportunity missed for Everton\nChelsea's hosts were lacking in creativity, but provided a stubborn and organised test that required the Blues to call on persistence and perseverance - attributes any title-winning side must have.\nResults on Saturday mean Everton will not finish lower than seventh this season, securing a best finish in three years and a spot in next season's Europa League.\nBut Koeman's men faced the league leaders with an outside chance of still creeping into the top four and sneaking a Champions League spot.\nIt will therefore be even more frustrating that they failed to make inroads against Chelsea and capitalise on Manchester City dropping two points.\nCalvert-Lewin's strike against the woodwork aside, there was little guile from the Toffees.\nAnd any chance they had of getting back into the game was squandered by clumsy defending for Chelsea's second goal, with Idrissa Gueye weak in the wall and Stekelenburg failing to get a stronger hand to the cross.\nCosta edges battle of the strikers\nThe game featured two of the Premier League's most prized poachers, with Everton's Romelu Lukaku and Chelsea's Diego Costa having scored 43 times between them this season.\nAsked this week which of the two he would prefer in his side, Chelsea boss Conte unsurprisingly backed his man, claiming 28-year-old Costa was the best striker in the world.\nThe Spain international may be five goals shy of Lukaku's 24 in the league, but the weight of the Blues forward's goals have been far more hefty - Chelsea would be 15 points worse off this season without his tally of 19.\nSo there was understandable concern from the bench when Costa stayed down holding his leg in the first half after a strong, but fair, tackle from Tom Davies.\nHe was fine to continue and, while he was not presented with a host of chances, the former Atletico Madrid man was a consistent influence, being shown a yellow card for a tackle on Stekelenburg after tireless closing down and being involved in the build-up to the final goal.\nLukaku, who continues to be linked with a return to Chelsea - whom he left in 2014 for a \u00a328m fee, was an energetic nuisance for the visiting defence but, aside from fizzing wide from 20 yards, looked unlikely to score for the first time in six appearances against his former club.\nMan of the match - Cesar Azpilicueta\n'It's important to celebrate' - what the managers said\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman on Sky Sports: \"We did well, until 1-0 maybe. After that we had more problems but that was all about their quality, before that we played well and made it tough for them.\n\"Maybe we didn't create a lot of chances, but I was happy. Idrissa Gueye played a fantastic game, Hazard was not the player he can be because of the man-marking.\n\"It is really tough to beat Chelsea. They showed their belief and their quality. They will be champions. We need to find the motivation to finish the season strongly.\"\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte speaking to Match of the Day: \"I must be relaxed when we win but I think it is very important to celebrate this win with the players and fans.\n\"I think we must continue this way - to play game by game and take three points in every game. We know every win in this part of the season is very important.\n\"The road is long so we need to rest and prepare in the right way.\"\nWhat's next?\nBoth sides come up against relegation-threatened clubs next, with Everton at Swansea on Saturday, 6 May and Chelsea hosting Middlesbrough on Monday, 8 May.\nChelsea reflecting title-winning season - the match stats\nChelsea have taken 81 points from 34 Premier League games this season; their most at this stage of a campaign since 2005-06 (85) when they won the title\nKoeman's two heaviest league defeats in charge of Everton have both come against Chelsea this term (5-0 and 3-0)\nThe Toffees failed to score in a Premier League game at Goodison Park for the first time in 2017, having averaged 3.7 goals per game prior to this defeat\nChelsea kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League since January (v Hull), ending an 11-game run without one\nCahill has scored more Premier League goals against Everton than against any other opponent (four)"

After the break, Boro retreated into a defensive mindset reminiscent of their play under former boss Aitor Karanka.\nThey still showed impressive organisation to repel City's siege with a number of key blocks, but it was no surprise that lively substitute Sane found a way back into the game for the visitors, albeit in contentious circumstances.\nThe Boro players were furious at the penalty decision and captain Ben Gibson did well to ensure De Roon and Fabio did not get themselves into more trouble than bookings for dissent.\nHowever, instead of losing their heads, the hosts looked renewed. The introduction of Adama Traore allowed them to strike again at the heart of a City defence who looked lightweight and nervy, even with the presence of captain Vincent Kompany.\nNegredo was dogged in the City area to prevent the visitors hacking the ball clear and force the ball on to Chambers, with the on-loan Arsenal defender calmly finishing past Willy Caballero.\nThey looked better when taking the game to City throughout but the perils of that approach were evident in conceding late on, ensuring a result away to Premier League leaders Chelsea on 8 May is even more of a necessity.\nMan of the match - Alvaro Negredo (Middlesbrough)\nCity limping over the line\nPep Guardiola's side have now won just two of their past eight Premier League games, jeopardising their bid to guarantee Champions League football next season.\nWest Brom, in eighth, are the highest-placed side that City have left to face, suggesting they should make the top four. But as Boro proved, any team is able to cause this side's defence problems.\nA draw, coupled with Chelsea's victory over Everton, ensures the Blues cannot mathematically win the Premier League title this season, ensuring Guardiola will miss out on a trophy in his first season with a club for the first time in his managerial career.\nThe Spaniard will not take that failure lightly and if several City players could be playing for their futures before a summer overhaul, plenty are failing that audition on this showing.\nJesus Navas was poor as a right wing-back, Aleksandar Kolarov resorted to striking wild efforts from distance despite playing at centre-back and fellow defender Nicolas Otamendi remains unconvincing. At one point Kompany was covering as he hauled down Traore just outside the area.\nThe introduction of Sane and Raheem Sterling just four minutes into the second half ultimately saved City's blushes and was a clear indication of Guardiola's frustrations with his starting side.\nA budding partnership?\nGuardiola opted to start Aguero and Jesus together for the first time, with the 20-year-old Brazilian having previously started in place of the Argentina striker before breaking his foot.\nWith both scoring, that decision proved successful but, in truth, the star pair were kept quiet for long periods by Middlesbrough's organised defence, as they badly lacked the service provided by the injured David Silva.\nRegardless, it is an experiment Guardiola will be tempted to revisit, with Jesus now having scored four goals in as many Premier League starts for Manchester City.\nAguero's penalty also made him the second-highest goalscorer in City's history, behind left-winger Eric Brook.\n'There are still nine points to play for' - manager reaction\nMiddlesbrough caretaker manager Steve Agnew: \"We were disappointed to concede at the end, but I think that the effort and bravery was a credit to the players. That was the fighting spirit that we have shown over the past few weeks.\n\"From where I was I didn't think that it was a penalty and I thought Sane went down very very easily. I find it strange that the referee can give the penalty from where he is positioned.\n\"There are still nine points to play for and with the spirit that the team has shown, there is no reason that we can't win more matches.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"The second half was better than the first one - we had problems trying to control their counter-attacks and we couldn't settle.\n\"It was tough as Middlesbrough are playing to stay in the league but we dropped another chance to take advantage. It will be tight until the last game because Manchester and Arsenal will be there.\n\"Gabriel Jesus was out for three months and made only four training sessions, but he's 20 so he could stay on the pitch for 90 minutes and he found himself well.\"\nCity extend unwanted away record - match stats\nThis draw means that Manchester City have set a new away-points record in a single PL campaign for the club (35 points - W11 D1).\nCity have failed to win any of their past 97 Premier League away games that they've been losing at half-time since a win against Blackburn in April 1995 (D12 L85).\nAlvaro Negredo has equalled his Premier League goal tally from his previous season in the competition (9 in 2013-14 with City).\nIndeed, this is the most in a Premier League season by a Boro striker since Mark Viduka (14) and Yakubu (12) in 2006-07.\nSergio Aguero has bagged 13 goals in his past 14 games for Man City in all competitions, assisting another three.\nWhat's next?\nMiddlesbrough face a tough task away to Premier League leaders Chelsea on Monday, 8 May, with kick-off at 20:00 BST.\nManchester City host Crystal Palace at the Etihad on Saturday, 6 May, kicking off at 12:30 BST."

Spurs were simply too good for Arsenal.\nMan of the match - Victor Wanyama\nWhat they said\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"To be above Arsenal for the first time in 22 years is fantastic for our fans. It is fantastic for us too, but we want to win the title.\n\"It was a very important game and it was a complete performance. We were better in the second half, putting on more pressure and creating more chances. The race for the title is down to four points and we will see what will happen.\"\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We did lose the game in a very quick space of time, and after that it took us time to recover.\n\"Spurs deserved to win, we have to accept that and analyse it. It is very disappointing, but the target at the beginning of the season is not to finish above Spurs, it is to win the league.\n\"They deserve it. We have a cup final to play, we have to fight for a place back in the top four.\n\"We couldn't afford to lose the game. We didn't score, we didn't score at Palace or West Brom. We have to play more and create more than we did.\"\nNine on the bounce for Tottenham\nTottenham have won nine consecutive league games for the first time since October 1960, when they won 13 in a row.\nKane is Tottenham's top scorer in Premier League north London derbies with six, overtaking Gareth Bale on five.\nKane has 27 goals in all competitions this season - only Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic (28) and Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (31) have scored more for Premier League teams this season.\nKane has only two goals in eight Premier League games against the other sides in the top six this season, but both goals have come against Arsenal.\nOnly Hull (10) have conceded more penalty goals than Arsenal (nine) in the Premier League this season.\nThis is now the highest-scoring Premier League fixture of all time, seeing 141 goals scored (80 for Arsenal, 61 for Spurs).\nThe Gunners have not won any of their past six league games against Spurs (drawing four and losing two), their longest winless run against them.\nWhat's next\nTottenham travel to West Ham on Friday while Arsenal take on Manchester United at Emirates Stadium on Sunday."

We must stay focused.\"\n'You bet he Can!'\nReds midfielder Can illuminated what had been an insipid opening 45 minutes with a moment of inspiration shortly before the break.\nThe Germany international, 23, carefully eyeballed Lucas' pinpoint diagonal pass into the Watford area, showing extraordinary athleticism to meet the delivery with a perfectly executed bicycle kick which left Gomes stranded.\nCan immediately raced towards the away dugout where he was mobbed by ecstatic team-mates and manager Klopp.\n\"That is the best goal I've ever scored,\" he said.\n\"I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was I wanted to head it, then I didn't think too much.\"\nTeam-mate Lallana added: \"It was a worldy goal and worthy of winning any game.\"\nHornets lack sting as they aim to better last season\nWatford midfielder Tom Cleverley warned Liverpool before kick-off that his side would still have \"a big say\" in the battle at the top of the table, with Walter Mazzarri's team rounding off their season with games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Everton.\nTheir priority is eclipsing the 13th-place finish and total of 45 points they secured in their top-flight return last year.\nAnd Hornets skipper Troy Deeney said he \"expected a reaction\" after a tame defeat at Hull in their previous game. However, that failed to materialise.\nWatford, for all their defensive resilience and organisation, offered little attacking spark as Liverpool controlled possession and territory before half-time.\nThe home side improved after the break as Etienne Capoue and Daryl Janmaat finally forced Reds keeper Mignolet into serious saves, before their best chance arrived in the final few seconds.\nLiverpool, as they have done often this season, failed to deal with a set-piece into their box as Prodl met a flick-on with a fierce strike that cannoned back off the bar.\nDespite their limp performance and daunting run-in, Watford are unlikely to be dragged into the relegation battle.\nMazzarri's side remain on 40 points - usually considered the benchmark for survival - eight above third-bottom Swansea who only have three games left.\nMan of the match - Emre Can (Liverpool)\nWhat's next?\nWatford go to defending champions Leicester City on Saturday (15:00 BST) as their tough run-in continues, while Liverpool host ninth-placed Southampton on Sunday (13:30).\nCan can't stop scoring...\nEmre Can has scored five Premier League goals this season, more than twice as many as in his previous two campaigns combined.\nLucas Leiva has three assists in his past five Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 163 top-flight games.\nLiverpool have won three consecutive Premier League away games under Jurgen Klopp for only the second time.\nLiverpool skipper James Milner made his 450th Premier League appearance in this game, the 22nd player to reach this mark.\nKlopp named the same Liverpool starting XI for the third consecutive Premier League game, something he had only done once before, in December.\nLiverpool have scored 16 goals in the 15 minutes before half-time in league games this season, more than any other side, while Watford have shipped the most in this period (17).\nWatford conceded for the first time in four Premier League home games.\nWatford's opponents have hit the woodwork 20 times in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nPost-match reaction\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri:\n\"I think that if you look at all of the Liverpool games that they play, they usually create five or six clear chances.\n\"We didn't concede them almost anything and had a couple of chances so overall it was a good performance.\n\"Usually I don't like to speak about luck but today we were completely unlucky.\n\"We didn't deserve to lose.\"\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:\n\"We have pressure and it means you fight for something that is good. It is positive pressure. We want to stay focused.\n\"We don't expect for a second it will be easy to reach the Champions League. If people think we have the three points against Southampton they can not have seen Southampton this season.\n\"We didn't play perfect against Watford and a draw would have been hard to accept, but we got the three points and that is all that the lads deserved.\""

That never looked like happening at a raucous London Stadium.\nTheir attacks lacked conviction, only Christian Eriksen going close with a 25-yard effort which flew past the right-hand post, as West Ham saw out the final few minutes to seemingly ruin Spurs' quest for a first title since 1961.\n\"We are still fighting,\" said Pochettino. \"We must wait but it is now more difficult.\"\nBilic future secured by derby win?\nHammers manager Slaven Bilic's future has come under scrutiny during a season in which they have rarely threatened to match last year's seventh-placed finish.\nBut nights like these, when West Ham showed they can compete with the Premier League's best, should go a long way to convincing owners David Sullivan and David Gold that he is the right man to take the club forward.\nBilic, 48, enjoyed an excellent debut campaign after replacing Sam Allardyce, but this season has had to carefully handle the acrimonious departure of star player Dimitri Payet, and the long-awaited move to the former Olympic Stadium.\nCrucially, he appears to retain the support of his players and many Hammers fans.\n\"He has my full backing, he is a great man,\" said skipper Mark Noble.\nVictory meant the Hammers passed the 40-point mark, mathematically ensuring their Premier League survival, as they moved into ninth - their joint-highest position of the campaign.\nAsked if the win helps secure his future, Bilic said: \"I don't care. When my team is playing like this, I'm happy.\n\"I think I'm doing a good job. I don't like to moan but we have had many obstacles during this season which are quite rare in football.\"\nMan of the match - Manuel Lanzini (West Ham)\nWhat's next?\nTottenham do not play again until Sunday, 14 May, when they host Manchester United at 16:30 BST - and by then the title might already have gone to Stamford Bridge.\nNevertheless, it will be an emotional occasion as it is Spurs' final home game at White Hart Lane.\nWest Ham also have a nine-day break, returning to action when Liverpool visit London Stadium at 14:15.\nPost-match reaction\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino:\n\"We deserved more from the game. We started well, dominated the first half and created chances but didn't score.\n\"We started the second half a little bit sloppy and we conceded a lot of space to them.\n\"When you are fighting for the title you need to try not to concede this type of goal.\n\"After that we showed a little bit of desperation to arrive quickly into the box, and we tried to play long balls.\n\"The reality is that we didn't score, not that we had a bad performance.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic:\n\"We deserved to win.\n\"We had a game plan, but the way we did it was magnificent. A great team display in terms of character and determination.\n\"To beat a team like Spurs you need more than that and we also showed quality.\n\"It was an important one for them and us, and under the lights on a Friday night, against them - you can't beat that feeling.\"\nSpurs don't love May...\nTottenham have lost their past three Premier League games in May and lost just three of 34 matches between August 2016 and April 2017\nWest Ham have now won three of their past four home Premier League games against Spurs, losing one\nLanzini has three Premier League goals against Spurs - only against Crystal Palace (four) does he have more\nWest Ham have kept three consecutive Premier League clean sheets for the first time since December 2015\nAndre Ayew has been involved in six goals in his past 11 Premier League games (four goals, two assists)\nThis was Spurs' first Premier League defeat to a side who started that day in the bottom of the half of the table since losing 5-1 to Newcastle United in the final match of last season\nThree of Spurs' past five away Premier League defeats have come when Anthony Taylor has refereed (also Newcastle and Liverpool)"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 5-0 Crystal Palace\nManchester City strengthened their grip on a top-four finish with a convincing win over Crystal Palace that moves them above Liverpool and into third place on goal difference.\nDavid Silva opened the scoring inside two minutes with City's quickest goal of the season, but it took a little longer before the scoreline reflected the home side's dominance.\nCity could not extend their lead before the break, despite a lacklustre start from a Palace side who are not yet assured of Premier League safety.\nThe Eagles almost managed an unlikely equaliser with their first effort at goal when Christian Benteke's header brought a fine reaction save from Willy Caballero.\nBut Pep Guardiola's side made sure of the points after the break, starting when captain Vincent Kompany turned home Kevin de Bruyne's cross with a fine first-time finish into the top corner.\nDe Bruyne, who also grazed the bar with a free-kick, made it 3-0 with a low shot from the edge of the area that Wayne Hennessey got a hand to, but could not keep out.\nRaheem Sterling added a fourth, latching on to substitute Pablo Zabaleta's clever header and smashing his shot into the bottom corner, before Nicolas Otamendi headed home De Bruyne's free-kick to complete the rout.\nGoals add shine to City's victory\nGuardiola said before kick-off that his side's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League rested on a run of three home games that started with the visit of the Eagles, and the manner of this victory represents the perfect start.\nIt was City's biggest home win since they thrashed Bournemouth 4-0 in September, back when Guardiola had a 100% winning record with City and his team were top of the table.\nThose days are long gone - their title hopes were officially ended by last week's draw at Middlesbrough - but this win, which equalled their biggest of the season in all competitions, was a timely return to goalscoring form.\nCity are only third on goal difference but they now have a four-goal advantage on Liverpool. And their position in the top four could be strengthened further when the teams in fifth and sixth, Manchester United and Arsenal, meet at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.\nPalace, meanwhile, will anxiously await the outcome of Hull and Swansea's home games later on Saturday.\nThe Eagles have a six-point cushion above the relegation zone, and a vastly superior goal difference to both of those teams even after this heavy defeat, but they may require another win to make sure of their survival.\nSilva sparkles to give City a lift\nOn Silva's first appearance since he was injured early in City's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal, it took one minute and 54 seconds for him to show what a difference he makes to his team.\nThe Spaniard finished off the move that gave City the lead, but he also started it - feeding Raheem Sterling with a chipped pass, before ghosting into the area to capitalise when Martin Kelly failed to clear Sterling's cross.\nThat was Silva's 50th goal for City but he has played a part in many more and pulled the strings again as City threatened to take Palace apart.\nHis link-up play with Leroy Sane and Sterling down both flanks was the biggest reason Palace were chasing shadows for the first half hour, and more composure from his team-mates inside the area would have seen his side out of sight long before half-time.\nNo repeat performance from Palace\nPalace had already beaten Chelsea and Liverpool away this season, and gone close to stopping Tottenham at White Hart Lane too.\nBut they never looked like staging a repeat performance against another team from the top four at the Etihad Stadium, where they have now lost on each of their six visits.\nIt was their lack of attacking threat that was the most surprising aspect of their performance, but few areas of their team emerged with any credit.\n\"Woeful\" was the verdict of BBC Radio 5 live co-commentator Danny Mills, who also suspected at one point the Palace players had \"their beach shorts and flip-flops on\".\nThey ended up on the wrong end of their heaviest defeat of the season, conceding five goals for the first time since they lost 5-4 to Swansea in November, but it could have been far more.\nMan of the match - David Silva\nDe Bruyne delivers - match stats\nCrystal Palace suffered their joint-biggest margin of defeat in a Premier League game (also 6-1 v Liverpool in August 1994 and 5-0 v Liverpool in November 1992).\nKevin de Bruyne has provided a league-high 15 assists this season; no Manchester City player has registered more in a single Premier League campaign.\nSam Allardyce has picked up just one point from his past nine top-flight visits to the Etihad.\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2010, Silva has been directly involved in 102 goals in the competition (38 goals, 64 assists), more than any other midfielder.\nNicolas Otamendi's goal was the 400th by an Argentine in the Premier League [excluding own-goals].\n\"My team was unrecognisable\" - manager reaction\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"Our performance was high level. I'm pleased for our people we can finally enjoy a lot of goals here.\n\"Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, even Everton... it's so important to play in the Champions League. It's in our hands.\"\nCrystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Radio 5 live: \"Our system did not cause us to concede today's first goal - our defender had to clear the ball and he didn't, and from it they scored. Individuals did not perform to our usual standards.\n\"My team was unrecognisable from what I've seen over the past two or three months - hopefully that is a one-off and the lads have got it out of their system ahead of the biggest game of the season next week at home to Hull.\"\nWhat next?\nCity have another early kick-off next Saturday when they host Leicester at 12:30 BST, but they will be taking nothing for granted. The Foxes thrashed them 4-2 at the King Power Stadium in December and won at the Etihad Stadium on their way to winning the title last season.\nPalace have the chance to end their relegation worries for good when they face the side directly below them, Hull, at Selhurst Park next Sunday (12:00)."

But some might question whether referee Paul Tierney was lenient with his punishment.\nStoke manager Mark Hughes said: \"A terrible challenge, the lad was out of control.\"\nSix minutes after the incident, Stoke took the lead. French forward Mousset was the unfortunate culprit when he headed past team-mate Artur Boruc from a Potters corner. It was the 21-year-old's first Premier League start.\nBirthday boy Smith integral for Cherries\nThe Cherries responded well after the break when the move of the match resulted in the equaliser. The exceptional Adam Smith - on his 26th birthday - delivered a low square ball which Joshua King allowed to go under his legs for Stanislas to fire home.\nBut back came Stoke. Diouf, who replaced the ill Saido Berahino in the starting XI, delayed his substitution by converting from five yards from Geoff Cameron's cross.\nHowever, with nine minutes of the 90 remaining, the Cherries equalised for a second time.\nRight-back Smith, signed from Tottenham in 2014, again delivered a great ball into the area which substitute Max Gradel nodded towards goal. His effort came off the boot of King, and then the unfortunate Shawcross, past Jack Butland in goal.\nMan of the match - Adam Smith (Bournemouth)\n'We are looking to beat last season's points total'\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \"It means everything to the club to establish ourselves in the Premier League. It is an incredibly tough league as we found this year.\n\"It was a real challenge to break down Stoke but we made it harder for ourselves by twice having to come from behind.\n\"We have the same points total as last year so now we are looking to beat that and try and finish in the top 10.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"Disappointed not to win but I thought it was a good performance. We had a game plan to frustrate them and it worked. I think their first goal was offside, and we are disappointed the referee did not see fit to send one of their players early off in the game.\n\"You saw the result for West Ham last night. By getting the three points they went up six places, it shows how close the middle group is. I felt we were the better side today.\"\nShawcross catching Dunne - the stats\nBoth sides have scored an own goal in a Premier League game for the first time since QPR v Liverpool in October 2014.\nStoke scored their first goal away from home in the Premier League in 629 minutes of action.\nBournemouth scored their fifth own goal of the season in the top flight (a joint-high along with Hull and Swansea) after scoring none last season.\nThe Cherries have scored four Premier League own goals in 2017 after only one in their previous 57 games in the competition.\nNo defender has registered more Premier League assists this season than Adam Smith (five, level with Kyle Walker).\nSince his Premier League debut in August 2008, Ryan Shawcross has scored five own goals. Only Martin Skrtel (seven) and Richard Dunne (six) have scored more in that time.\nWhat's next?\nThe Cherries face Burnley at home next Saturday (15:00 BST), while Stoke host Arsenal on the same day (17:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Leicester City 3-0 Watford\nLeicester City guaranteed their Premier League survival with a deserved home victory over struggling Watford.\nThe 2015-16 champions took the lead when Wilfred Ndidi blasted in from 10 yards out after the Hornets had failed to clear Danny Drinkwater's dinked cross following a short corner.\nThe Foxes twice hit the woodwork before Riyad Mahrez doubled the lead as he pounced on a mistake from Adrian Mariappa to shoot low past Heurelho Gomes.\nMarc Albrighton added a third goal in injury time when he collected Jamie Vardy's pass and shot into the net.\nWatford, who suffered their third successive defeat, dropped to 15th in the Premier League, six points above the relegation zone with three games remaining.\nRelieve Leicester's game with Watford as it happened\nPremier League reaction and analysis\nLeicester's Ranieri sacking justified\nThe three points for Leicester finally ended any lingering doubts they would drop into the Championship only 12 months after securing their first ever Premier League title.\nIndeed, the tight nature of the division takes the Foxes up to ninth, as they aim for only their second top-10 finish in English football's top flight in 17 seasons.\nIt has been a disappointing defence of their title, but to have secured their survival with three games remaining can be seen as a success, considering the position they were in when Craig Shakespeare replaced the sacked Claudio Ranieri in February, with the club only one point above the relegation zone.\nIndeed, they have won seven and drawn one of the 10 Premier League games that Shakespeare has been in charge of, and they capitalised on some poor Watford defending in their latest win.\nA cross from the unmarked Danny Drinkwater set up the first goal as Watford failed to pay attention from a short corner, although the Hornets' Etienne Capoue had a chance to clear the danger before Ndidi smashed home.\nThe second goal saw Mahrez punish Mariappa's mistake to score from a tight angle before Albrighton sealed the win ending a fine counter-attack as his shot, following Vardy's pass, went in off the post.\nWhere next for Watford and Mazzarri?\nWatford have now failed to score in three matches and, mathematically at least, they could still go down.\nFor the Hornets to be relegated, they have to lose all three of their matches, Hull have to win twice convincingly, Swansea need to win both of their games and Crystal Palace need to pick up two points.\nWatford, who end their season with games against Everton, Chelsea and Manchester City, had chances against Leicester but Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel did well to deny Stefano Okaka and two efforts from Tom Cleverley.\nHowever, Leicester also had further opportunities and twice hit the woodwork - Mariappa inadvertently shooting against his own post and Mahrez seeing a deflected effort bounce off the top of the crossbar.\nWatford finished 13th in the Premier League last season, a position that was not good enough for Quique Sanchez Flores to keep his job, and, given his side's poor run, boss Walter Mazzarri will be concerned about his own future at the club.\nMan of the match - Riyad Mahrez (Leicester City)\nWatford's problems away from home continue - stats\nCraig Shakespeare is only the fourth manager to win his first five home Premier League games, after Manuel Pellegrini (11), Sven Goran Eriksson (nine) and Carlo Ancelotti (seven).\nRiyad Mahrez scored on his 100th Premier League appearance - the first Algerian to reach that milestone in the competition.\nMahrez has now scored in each of his past three Premier League appearances against the Hornets, the first time he's done so against a single opponent in the division.\nWatford have failed to score in five consecutive away league games for the first time since December 1979 (a run of seven).\nJamie Vardy's assist for Marc Albrighton's goal was his 60th goal involvement in the Premier League, more than any other Leicester player in the competition (41 goals, 19 assists).\nWatford have never won a Premier League game in which they've been losing at half-time, drawing seven and losing 48.\nOnly against Chelsea in August 2014 (eight) has Kasper Schmeichel made more saves in a Premier League game for Leicester than the seven he made today.\n'We have to be pleased with what we have achieved' - what they said\nLeicester City manager Craig Shakespeare told BBC Sport: \"I'm pleased with the result, the performance wasn't quite there but ultimately it is about the result and it is another clean sheet.\n\"When I took over, the most important thing was to be competitive, climb the table and never set a points target. Now mathematically we are safe. In football you have to try and win every game, of course it is difficult, but we have to be pleased with what we have achieved.\"\nOn picking up 22 points in 10 Premier League games since replacing the sacked Claudio Ranieri, Shakespeare added: \"It is not a bad return, but all the credit has to go to the players.\n\"The remit was to take it [the manager's job] until the end of the season and we will then sit down and discuss it. I've not been told anything else so that's what we will do.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri told BBC Sport: \"We are disappointed and am sorry for our fans. We committed some individual mistakes, their goalkeeper made some fantastic saves, they played on the counter-attack and managed to score some goals.\n\"I am very sorry to lose 3-0 against this team. In the first half, we could have scored before them and they punished us for stupid individual mistakes. You wouldn't commit these mistakes if you had more experience. We have a very young squad.\n\"I am not thinking about my future. We managed to get to 40 points with six matches left, that was our objective, maybe the players were a bit tired.\"\nWhat's next?\nWatford play at Everton on Friday, 12 May (19:45 BST) and Leicester are away at Manchester City on Saturday, 13 May (12:30 BST)."

        "article_text": "Hull City 0-2 Sunderland\nHull dropped into the relegation zone as they suffered a first home defeat under Marco Silva against relegated Sunderland.\nThe hosts created several chances, only for Lazar Markovic and Abel Hernandez - most notably - to be denied by impressive away keeper Jordan Pickford.\nSunderland took advantage to go ahead through Billy Jones' close-range diving header after John O'Shea's flick-on from a corner.\nAnd the Black Cats sealed their first win in 11 league matches when Jermain Defoe converted from close range.\nHull fell to 18th place after Swansea beat Everton 1-0 later on Saturday to move one point above the Tigers.\nFollow all the post-match reaction from Saturday's Premier League matches\nRelive Hull v Sunderland\nHull's survival hopes dented by Black Cats\nThe turnaround in Hull's fortunes since the arrival of former Olympiakos boss Silva has been quite remarkable, giving them more than a fighting chance to retain their top-flight status.\nThe Tigers had taken 19 points from a possible 21 in the Portuguese boss' seven previous matches at the KCOM Stadium and had identified this game as one which they must win.\nThe home side worked hard, as you would expect, but lacked confidence and ingenuity in the final third.\nAnd when they did manage to find the target, they were denied by the excellent Pickford.\nOn-loan Liverpool midfielder Markovic saw a thumping header tipped over by the England Under-21 international, who then stopped Hernandez's sweeping shot from Andrew Robertson's left-wing cross at his near post.\nThe nervy home crowd provided an atmosphere more of hope rather than expectation from almost the first whistle, and that pretty much turned to resignation after Jones put Sunderland ahead.\n\"The dressing room is down, we're not happy,\" said left-back Robertson. \"It is not good enough to lose 2-0 at home to a team that has just been relegated.\"\nHope for Sunderland's rebuilding process?\nSunderland might have already been consigned to Championship football next season by last week's defeat against Bournemouth, but the Black Cats knew they could still have a major influence on who would join them.\nDavid Moyes' men might have hampered Hull's hopes on Saturday, but they can also help the Tigers next weekend when they host Swansea at the Stadium of Light.\nIf the Black Cats show the same level of fight and determination then Hull's cause might not yet be lost.\nIt is an attribute that has been missing for most of a woeful season, but they finally gave their 2,000 travelling fans something to cheer with a first win since 4 February.\nMoyes says he will remain in charge next season when the Wearside club bid to bounce straight back up and, although there is likely to be a big turnover in playing staff, the Scot will have been encouraged by the energetic performance of young midfielder George Honeyman as he plots the rebuilding process.\n\"After being relegated, players have to stand up and show some pride for the club, and today they have done that,\" said Moyes.\n\"We had a really good team performance. If we had shown the character and level of performance today throughout the season we'd have many more points.\"\nMan of the match Pickford like 'a young Joe Hart'\nOne man who may not be at Sunderland next season - and not because Moyes does not want him - is Pickford.\nThe 23-year-old goalkeeper has been the shining light in a gloomy season, producing a number of impressive performances which led to a nomination for the PFA Young Player of the Year.\nUnsurprisingly he reportedly interests a host of top-flight clubs who could tempt the Black Cats into selling with a big-money summer bid.\nMoyes remains confident Pickford will not leave - warning potential suitors that would have \"to pay the price\".\nAgainst Hull, Pickford showed again why he is rated as one of the country's top goalkeepers.\nHis performance meant Hull, following a 3-0 defeat in the reverse fixture, became the first Premier League team this season not to score against the Wearsiders.\n\"I remember a young Joe Hart when he started - at Everton we were really keen to sign him from Shrewsbury. That's a young Jordan Pickford, he makes saves and comes for crosses and has saved us points throughout the season,\" said Moyes.\n\"Honestly, I expect this level of performance from him on a regular basis - that's how highly I think of him.\"\n'There was big tension in some of the team'\nHull manager Marco Silva said: \"It's disappointing. We had chances to score in many moments of the game. Ultimately there was big tension in some of the team. We need to be calm in some moments.\n\"When you don't do this you start to lose focus and we conceded two from set-pieces. Now is the moment to rest and analyse.\n\"It's an important moment for us. We didn't achieve what we wanted from the match but we have two more games.\"\nNo more home comforts for Silva\nMarco Silva lost a home league match as a manager for the first time since March 2014 while manager of Portuguese side Estoril (W34 D7 L1)\nSunderland have secured two wins in the same season against a single club for the first time in 2016-17 and for only the third occasion since 2013-14. The other two occasions were both against Newcastle (in 2013-14 and 2014-15)\nBilly Jones is Sunderland's eighth different goalscorer in the Premier League this season - which is still two fewer than any other team\nSunderland have scored for only the third time in their past 14 Premier League games, winning two of those games, both away from home\nJermain Defoe ended his goalless streak in what was his 11th Premier League appearance since he last scored against Crystal Palace on 4 February (1,035 minutes)\nSebastian Larsson recorded his 26th assist in the Premier League but his first since a 3-0 win against Norwich in April 2016\nWhat's next?\nHull go to fifth-bottom Crystal Palace on Sunday, 14 May (12:00 BST). The Eagles are four points clear of City, and have a far superior goal difference.\nSunderland play their final Premier League game at the Stadium of Light - for a season at the very least - when they host Swansea on Saturday, 13 May (15:00 BST)."

If they win both games they will stay up.\nHull are away at Crystal Palace, who are four points above the relegation zone after a 5-0 defeat at Manchester City, on 14 May before hosting second-placed Tottenham on the last day.\nPalace's final match of the season is at Manchester United, who are unbeaten in their past 24 league games.\nHull result inspires the Swans\nFor the Swans, a passionate fanbase turned into a delirious one before a ball was even kicked in south Wales, after Sunderland's victory over Hull.\nThat lifted a boisterous Liberty Stadium, but it took almost half an hour before Swansea created a big opportunity in a cagey contest.\nWhen they did, they took it expertly, Llorente heading home from close range after Ayew's twisting run and deflected cross fell perfectly.\nHolgate then produced an outstanding challenge to deny Mawson, with a Jagielka block also denying Martin Olsson's effort from an acute angle.\nSwansea continued to carve out the better chances, Ayew's volley with the outside of his foot hitting the post, and it was not until the 66th minute that Lukasz Fabianski was seriously tested by Lukaku's 20-yard shot.\nThe hosts spurned further chances through Llorente and Fer. It might have cost Swansea at the death when their former skipper Ashley Williams was inches away from heading home, but he couldn't quite convert from Kevin Mirallas' flick-on.\nEverton eyes on next season\nEverton stay seventh, two points behind sixth-placed Arsenal but having played three games more than the Gunners.\nThe Toffees have the feel of a club already building for next term.\nRoss Barkley, whose future in unclear as his contract runs down, was dropped by Ronald Koeman as was loanee Enner Valencia.\nBarkley's introduction at half-time was evidence that Everton had lacked panache in the final third, with Fabianski entirely untroubled before the break.\nEverton had won eight of their past 11 visits to Swansea, but not even returning Wales captain Williams - whose every touch was jeered by a section of the home fans - could inspire the visitors.\nMan of the Match - Fernando Llorente (Swansea City)\n'Hull result gave us a lift' - what they said\nSwansea boss Paul Clement: \"It is one of my proudest moments. What a fantastic, gritty performance. It was so important we got that result after what happened at Hull.\n\"We have hit some form both offensively and especially defensively. We have played against really good opposition and seven points from three games is a fantastic tally.\n\"It gave us a lift before the game knowing that result had gone in our favour, we knew if we did something special we could get out of the relegation zone.\n\"We really defended well.\"\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"It was not good enough. The difference is one goal, we had maybe more ball possession, it was difficult to create open chances.\n\"The final part, we had to be a little bit more aggressive in the box. The problem is in the last few weeks to create chances - we don't score in the last three games.\n\"In my opinion, seventh position is a good position and next Friday is important to give the fans a win they deserve.\"\n'End of season goal drought' - the stats\nEverton have failed to score in their past three Premier League games for the first time since a four-game drought in April 2006.\nSwansea have taken seven points from their past three league games after picking up just one in the six before that.\nThe Toffees have lost an away league game in Wales for the first time in their past 11 games there (W5 D5), since a 1-0 defeat to Cardiff at Ninian Park in December 1956.\nThis is Fernando Llorente's best goal haul in a league season (13) since 2013-14 (16 with Juventus).\nJordan Ayew has provided an assist in three of his past six Premier League games, this after failing to assist in any of his first 36 in the competition.\nWhat's next?\nSwansea visit relegated Sunderland in their penultimate match of the season on Saturday, 13 May (15:00 BST), while Everton host 15th-placed Watford next Friday (19:45 BST)."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 0-0 Southampton\nJames Milner missed a second-half penalty as Liverpool's hopes of securing a Premier League top-four spot suffered a blip in a goalless draw against Southampton.\nIt was a terrible spectacle for the supporters inside Anfield. Liverpool rarely tested Saints keeper Fraser Forster, bar the penalty and Marko Grujic's header late in the game. The visitors, meanwhile, failed to muster even one effort on target.\nThe Reds' best chance to score came in the 66th minute when they won a penalty after Southampton's Jack Stephens was judged to have handled Lucas' delivery.\nMilner, who had not missed from the spot in the league since November 2009, saw his effort saved by Forster who dived low to his right. Seconds earlier, the England keeper approached the midfielder as he attempted to place the ball on the spot - and the tactic seemed to work.\nThe draw sees the Reds move up to third, above Manchester City, on 70 points. However, Pep Guardiola's side have a game in hand.\nManchester United are five points behind after losing to Arsenal, who are two points further back.\nRelive the action from Anfield here\nLiverpool underwhelm in crucial period\nIt was dire. Truly dire. Was the first half of this match the worst seen in the Premier League this season?\nThe home sections at Anfield must have thought they were in for a treat - the sun was shining and they knew their team had to take the game to Southampton with a Champions League spot at stake.\nBut instead of a siege on Forster's goal, what they witnessed during that opening period were their players joining the Saints on the beach.\nThe first 45 minutes were slow and ponderous, and the only exertions by the Southampton keeper were three very comfortable saves.\nThe second half followed a similar pattern up until the penalty, which was a correct decision by referee Bobby Madley with the Stephens' arm moving up to push the ball away.\nHowever, Milner - who last missed a Premier League penalty playing for Aston Villa against Bolton - saw his effort saved by Forster. Was he put off his stride by the keeper confronting him moments earlier?\nForster kept his concentration right up until the final few minutes of the game when he reacted brilliantly to tip over substitute Grujic's header.\nThe Reds have now played Southampton four times this season and failed to score against them.\nSaints play on the back foot but get a point\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel appeared somewhat surprised this week\n, external\nwhen he was asked about reports regarding his future.\n, external\nIt had been suggested that some players had become disillusioned with his style of management.\nTheir Premier League status was only made secure with Hull's defeat on Saturday, and they came into the match on the back of two defeats and a draw.\nAt Anfield, the team must have bored their travelling fans into submission.\nThe graphic above shows that they mostly sat in their own half for the opening 45 minutes, and for the first time since they returned to the top flight in 2012 they failed to have a single effort in the first half of a match. An angled strike by Nathan Redmond in the second half was the closest they came to scoring - although it was a few yards wide.\nHaving been spoilt for entertainment when their team was managed by Ronald Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino, some Southampton fans must be wondering what type of football awaits them next season if Puel stays.\nMan of the match - Fraser Forster (Southampton)\n'Southampton did not create anything'\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"I thought our performance was good enough to win. Southampton wanted to come here and somehow get a point, or more - I'm fine with defending.\n\"They did not create anything and we had a hard job to do. To play against 10 deep defending Southampton players is very difficult. We could have scored, that would have opened them up a bit. It is a point more, but it doesn't feel like that.\n\"It is not finished yet. We all have to play our games. We go to West Ham and try to win, and that's all we can do. We try everything and we do not stop.\"\nSaints manager Claude Puel: \"I think it was a fantastic job for us. We defended very well and with quality and good organisation.\n\"Perhaps we could have done better with the counter-attack, but we showed good energy, spirit and organisation.\n\"It was difficult for them to come into our box and for me it was a harsh penalty and a good save. It was a deserved point.\"\nForster: 'Liverpool's nemesis' - the stats\nLiverpool have drawn 0-0 home and away against the same opponent in a Premier League season for the first time since 2008-09 against Stoke.\nThe Reds had 32 shots in the league matches without scoring against the Saints this season.\nJurgen Klopp has never beaten Southampton in the Premier League (D3 L1) - indeed, he has now faced them more than any other opponent without winning.\nForster saved his first Premier League penalty - Milner's effort was the ninth he'd faced.\nForster was the first opposition goalkeeper to save a league penalty at Anfield since Rob Green stopped Steven Gerrard's effort for QPR in May 2015.\nIndeed, only Vito Mannone (13 for Sunderland in January) has made more saves against Liverpool in a Premier League game this season than Forster (eight).\nOnly Hull (12) have conceded more Premier League penalties this season than Southampton (nine).\nThe Saints failed to have a single shot on target in either Premier League game against Liverpool this season.\nWhat's next?\nThe Reds are at West Ham next Sunday (14:15 BST) and the Saints are at St Mary's on Wednesday to face Arsenal (19:45 BST)."

But this season he will be a different kind of title-winner.\nThe signing of N'Golo Kante from Leicester City and Chelsea's subsequent success has meant Fabregas, who would have been first choice in almost every other Premier League side, has been marginalised and unable to claim a regular place.\nWhen he has, however, the Spain midfielder has shown the class and quality that has made him one of the game's enduring talents in the recent era.\nFabregas stepped in here for the injured Kante and gave a midfield masterclass, and when he created Chelsea's opener for Costa he became the first player to record 10 Premier League assists in six different seasons.\nHe also created Chelsea's third for Matic with a glorious instinctive flick that unlocked Middlesbrough again.\nFabregas may wish to seek more regular first team football elsewhere despite being on course to claim another Premier League title winners' medal - and on this evidence there will be no shortage of takers.\nMiddlesbrough go down without a fight\nMiddlesbrough knew they were fighting against all the odds to try and avoid the defeat that would send them back into the Championship - and it was a battle they never looked like winning.\nThey were on the back foot from the first whistle and were simply overwhelmed by a Chelsea side who would not be denied. The Middlesbrough fans, who were stoic throughout, were applauded by Conte after the final whistle.\nThe feeling will remain that Middlesbrough have simply come and gone without contributing a great deal to this Premier League season. Could they have been bolder in pursuit of survival?\nBoro have proved stubborn in defence on many occasions but have been totally undermined by a failure to score goals - and a failure to cure that obvious problem.\nAitor Karanka, the man who brought Middlesbrough up but who left in March as the decline started to accelerate, was backed by chairman Steve Gibson in January but his attacking purchases were never going to provide the answer.\nRudy Gestede arrived from Aston Villa and Patrick Bamford from Chelsea, but neither are of Premier League quality and the price was paid with relegation.\nMiddlesbrough look to currently have a good squad for the Championship - but this was a horribly tame end to their Premier League ambitions.\nMan of the match - Cesc Fabregas\n'The fans deserve Premier League football' - What the managers said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte: \"We must be pleased. It was a great performance, my players showed commitment and work-rate for three important points.\n\"At this stage it was important to win and exploit Tottenham's defeat. Now, another step to the title. We have to rest well and prepare for West Brom.\"\nMiddlesbrough boss Steve Agnew: \"I am absolutely gutted and bitterly disappointed with the result and we have now lost our Premier League status which we took great pride in.\n\"I have just left a very silent dressing room.\n\"We haven't had enough wins and that's the key to the whole thing. Scoring goals wins football matches and we haven't done that enough this season.\n\"I have to say the fans all season have been outstanding - home and away has been top class and the least they deserve is Premier League football.\"\nBoro make it four relegations - the stats\nChelsea have become the third club to win 300 Premier League home games, after Manchester United (347) and Arsenal (306)\nMiddlesbrough have been relegated from the Premier League for the fourth time - no side has suffered the drop more often since its inception [level with Crystal Palace, Norwich City and Sunderland]\nDiego Costa became the third player to score 20+ goals in a Premier League season for Chelsea on two occasions [Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in 2000-01 & 2001-02 and Didier Drogba in 2006-07 & 2009-10]\nCosta has also scored the opening goal of a Premier League game on seven occasions this season - no other player has done so more\nMiddlesbrough have failed to score in 11 Premier League away games this season, more than any other side in the division\nWhat's next?\nChelsea will win the title if they beat West Brom on Friday.

Their best chance came in the first half when Manolo Gabbiadini forced a fine save out of Petr Cech from close range, and they stay 10th.\nThe win means Arsenal move above Manchester United into fifth, three points behind fourth-placed Manchester City.\nRelive Arsenal's win at Southampton\nSanchez saves Arsenal in 'must-win' game\nAn awful run of form from January until early April had seriously threatened to end Arsene Wenger's record of securing a top four finish in every season he has had at Arsenal.\nHowever, four wins in their six games prior to the trip to St Mary's had given hope that the season would not peter out.\nIn what was a must-win game, Arsenal's players initially failed to rise to the challenge.\nThey were ponderous in possession and lacked bite in attack. Too often they played passes square just inside the Southampton half before gifting possession back to the hosts when they approached the final third.\nBut in Sanchez they possess a player capable of producing something from nothing and that is exactly what he did midway through the second half.\nHis goal, which came after he sold two Southampton players a dummy to give himself a clear shot on goal, visibly relaxed Arsenal and from then on they played with confidence and freedom, allowing them to open up the hosts for a second time when Giroud headed in Aaron Ramsey's cross.\nThe only negative for Arsenal was the loss of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to injury in the second half, although Wenger suggested it was not serious.\nSanchez has now scored 20 goals this season, making him only the fifth Arsenal player to reach that mark, after Ian Wright, Thierry Henry, Emmanuel Adebayor and Robin van Persie.\nIt was also his 14th away from home - more than another Premier League player has managed this campaign.\nVictory not only moves Arsenal, who face Chelsea in the FA Cup final later this month, to within one win of Manchester City, but also four points behind Liverpool, who have played a game more.\nIn a season that has seen protests against Wenger and some fans calling for the Frenchman to leave, the possibility they could finish with FA Cup success and a place in the top four is a very real one.\nPuel under pressure?\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel's long-term future is reportedly uncertain,\n, external\nwith the Frenchman yet to show signs of taking the club forward since replacing Ronald Koeman last summer.\nSaints did reach the final of the League Cup but have been firmly ensconced in mid-table in the Premier League this season, a disappointment having finished sixth last year.\nThe Gunners brushed aside Southampton 5-0 in the FA Cup in January and the hosts never looked like gaining revenge in this fixture.\nOnce again, Southampton were weak in attack. They had two shots on target in this game and have now managed just 12 shots on target across their last six Premier League games.\nWith Saints struggling for goals and key players like defender Virgil van Dijk said to be attracting interest from other clubs,\n, external\nPuel - if he is still at the club - faces a challenging summer of improving the squad to get them moving in the right direction once again.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\nWe stuck together - what they said\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel speaking to Match of the Day: \"It's often the same against the big six. We cannot find a win. Every time we play good quality football with chances but without the clinical edge and it's harsh on the players.\n\"For me, we deserved at minimum a draw and maybe a win. For them, in one situation, they scored. It's difficult to accept.\"\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger said: \"We were focused and I felt that when we suffered we stuck together.\n\"We have another clean sheet and I know we can go forward and score goals. The whole team was dynamic, focused and showed a convincing desire to win the game.\"\nArsenal end Southampton hoodoo - the stats\nArsenal ended a run of five winless Premier League games at St Mary's, claiming their first win there since December 2003.\nThis is Sanchez's best ever league goal return in the top five European leagues, beating his previous best of 19 in 2013-14 with Barcelona.\nThe Gunners have won four of their past five Premier League games (L1) since adopting a three-man defence.\nSouthampton have had 29 shots in their last three Premier League games without scoring.\nOlivier Giroud has six Premier League substitute goals this season - only Adam Le Fondre (eight in 2012-13) has more in a single campaign than the Frenchman.\nGiroud's goal was his 100th in the top-flight of European football (33 in Ligue 1, 67 in the Premier League).\nWhat next?\nSouthampton, who cannot finish higher than eighth, travel to already-relegated Middlesbrough on Saturday, 13 May (15:00 BST).\nArsenal, meanwhile, continue their bid to break into the top four with a trip to Stoke in Saturday's evening kick-of (17:30)."

        "article_text": "Everton 1-0 Watford\nRoss Barkley's goal settled Everton's meeting with Watford after the build-up to the match was dominated by uncertainty over the midfielder's Goodison Park future.\nBarkley swept home a curling shot from 20 yards shortly after break as Sebastian Prodl failed to close him down.\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman said on Thursday that Barkley had until next weekend to agree to a contract extension or he would be sold.\nWatford rarely threatened, although the physicality of Stefano Okaka caused a few nervy moments late on.\nEnner Valencia could have made the scoreline more comfortable for the hosts but was denied by a good save from Heurelho Gomes.\nBarkley goal disguises complex decision\nEverton chairman Bill Kenwright and majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri joined the standing ovation for Barkley when he departed the action 10 minutes from time, but it could yet also be a farewell to the home fans.\nKoeman's public ultimatum seemed to spur the 23-year-old into life as he swerved in the box and tested Gomes with a low hard shot in the opening minutes.\nHis fifth Premier League goal of the season came soon after the interval as Prodl's retreat allowed him the time and the angle to beat Gomes.\nHowever the energy of Kevin Mirallas - who signed a new three-year deal before kick-off - and the obvious promise of Tom Davies, still only 18, showed why Everton are prepared to play hardball in their negotiations.\nGiven Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson and Ajax's Davy Klaassen have been mentioned as possible midfield recruits,\n, external\nand taking into account his sporadic form over the whole season, it may well be that Barkley needs Everton more than they need him.\nWatford effectively safe... but with work to do\nWatford could still be relegated in theory, but in reality, with six points and a far superior goal difference to 18th-placed Hull, their Premier League status is safe.\nDespite losing Christian Kabasele to an apparent hamstring injury before half-time, the Hornets hung in and could have rescued an unlikely point had Troy Deeney managed to steer home a late half-chance.\nThere is no shame in failing to take anything away to an Everton side who have achieved their best home league record since 1989-90.\nHowever, Watford are still five points short of the total amassed under Quique Sanchez Flores last term, and owners the Pozzo family will need to invest to avoid falling behind next season.\nMan of the match - Morgan Schneiderlin (Everton)\n'It is not up to me or the board' - what they said\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"I am really proud of the players' record at home this season with 13 wins in the 19 games. We did not have the aggression and intensity in the first half, but we were better after the break.\n\"Ross' goal is what we need, more goals from midfield. We hope that he will sign the contract, but it is not up to me, or the board, it is up to the player. We have offered Ross a really good contract. We cannot wait until the summer, until August.\n\"I am really happy. I think that we have had a really good season, finishing behind the big six in the Premier League. We need to do better away from home, but that is for next season.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri: \"I congratulated all the players on their effort in the dressing room. We did not deserve to lose. We deserved a draw at least.\n\"I am very happy with the performance because my players gave everything. I am not concerned because I have seen a lot of Everton games.\n\"They have won 12 of 18 games at home this season before today, and rarely have a team put them under the pressure we managed.\"\nPremier League-best season at Goodison - post-match stats\nEverton have now won 43 points at Goodison Park in the Premier League this season, their most in a top-flight campaign at home since 1989-90 (45).\nWatford have lost six consecutive away league games without scoring for the first time since May 1952.\nRoss Barkley's opener ended a run of 12 Premier League matches without a goal for the Everton midfielder.\nIn the Premier League, only Mikel Arteta (10) has scored more goals from outside the box for the Toffees than Ross Barkley (eight).\nJose Holebas received his 13th yellow card of the season against Everton, two more than any other player. The record for most yellow cards received in a Premier League season is 14 (Mark Hughes, Cheick Tiote, Robbie Savage and Lee Cattermole).\nIt is now 617 minutes since the Hornets scored a Premier League away goal.\nWhat's next?\nEverton's final game of the season is on Sunday 21 May, away to Arsenal. Watford play newly-crowned Premier League champions Chelsea on Monday evening."

Only Manchester United (13) have won more Premier League titles.\nChelsea are the first club to win the English top-flight title on a Friday since Arsenal at Anfield in 1989.\nConte is the fourth Italian manager to win the English top-flight title after Ancelotti, Roberto Mancini and Claudio Ranieri.\nChelsea scored with their 23rd shot of the match at West Brom.\nA Belgian player has scored the title-deciding goal in each of the past three Premier League seasons (Batshuayi v West Brom in 2016-17, Eden Hazard v Tottenham in 2015-16 and v Crystal Palace in 2014-15).\nWhat next?\nChelsea still have two games to play in their title-winning season. They host Watford on Monday (20:00 BST) before receiving the trophy in their final game against relegated Sunderland at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, 21 May (15:00 BST). They then have the FA Cup final on 27 May.\nWest Brom travel to Manchester City on Tuesday, 16 May before finishing their season at Swansea the following Sunday (15:00 BST)."

The recalled Bamford could not combine with Alvaro Negredo and Stewart Downing to regularly trouble Saints.\nAs bad as Boro have been at scoring goals this season, their increasing defensive frailty in the second half of the campaign is also an important a factor in their relegation. Steve Agnew's side have conceded 30 times since Christmas out of a total of 50 for the season so far.\nHere they continually allowed Redmond free rein down the left flank and were duly punished soon after the break - a goal that ultimately settled the game as Boro gave themselves too much to do despite a spirited reaction in the final 20 minutes.\nUnder the guidance of respected chairman Steve Gibson, the club will hope to make an immediate return to the Premier League next season, having endured a seven-year absence from the top flight before this campaign.\nHowever, captain Ben Gibson will have his suitors this summer, Negredo and Chambers will likely return to their parent clubs, while someone might take a chance on the mercurial talents of winger Adama Traore.\nThe future of head coach Agnew is also up in the air. Can Middlesbrough keep it together and bounce back?\nMan of the match - Nathan Redmond (Southampton)\nSaints revive scoring form\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel made seven changes to the starting line-up, handing a debut to centre-back Martin Caceres and a first start for right-back Jeremy Pied, reflecting the feeling this was a somewhat inconsequential match.\nThe visitors duly struggled to get going in the first half, until a simple but effective move saw Jordy Clasie stroke a ball down the right for Long to surge onto and find Rodriguez, who had cleverly checked his run for a low finish under Guzan.\nThat was Saints' first goal in four matches and seemed to loosen them up, especially once Redmond was introduced for Sofiane Boufal to cap a fine performance with an excellent finish.\nPuel's side also ended a winless run of five games, while Charlie Austin - who remains the club's top scorer this season despite not playing since December - returned from a long-standing shoulder injury as a late substitute.\nThey were guilty of easing off once Guzan had conceded the penalty - Long failing to convert the chance to put the game beyond doubt and his defence compounding the error by letting Boro build momentum following Bamford's goal.\nHowever, the task proved to be beyond the hosts and Saints look set to secure an impressive fourth-straight finish in the Premier League top 10 despite the regular departure of key players and managers.\n'We haven't given the fans enough' - manager reaction\nMiddlesbrough boss Steve Agnew: \"The supporters have been fantastic all season. They've waited a long time to get back in the Premier League and we haven't given them enough, we owed them that lap of appreciation.\n\"We were disappointed with the first-half performance.

His angled drive - set up by a neat pass from former Black Cats loan player Ki Sung-yueng - ensured there would be no late nerves.\nIt is now up to Hull to respond, otherwise Clement can lead his side into their final fixture at home to West Brom safe in the knowledge he will have a summer to prepare the Swans for a sixth successive top-flight campaign.\nSunderland's deficiencies laid bare\nSunderland's defeat by Bournemouth two weeks ago confirmed the end of their 10-season stay in the Premier League.\nBut two vastly contrasting displays since mean the Black Cats have provided a potentially decisive parting shot in the battle to avoid joining them in the Championship.\nAt the KCOM Stadium last weekend, they showed enough in a 2-0 victory to give some hope that, with some strategic planning and rebuilding, they could bounce straight back to the top flight.\nBut Saturday's heartless display, played out in front of a half-empty stadium that was almost devoid of home fans by full-time, laid bare just how much work they have to do.\nAny promotion effort next season looks unlikely to feature striker Jermain Defoe, who has scored 15 times this campaign but has a relegation release clause in his contract and appeared to be saying goodbye during a solo lap of the ground at full-time.\nManager David Moyes has suggested he will continue in his role, but the home fans aimed negative chants in his direction during this game.\nThe Black Cats end their home campaign having earned just 14 points - the fewest in the division - and with a run of 10 games without victory, seven of which they failed to score in.\nMan of the match - Fernando Llorente (Swansea)\n'It is not done yet' - what the managers said\nSunderland boss David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Everyone watching can see we need big changes. We need to alter the playing staff and I think everyone is aware of that.\n\"Jordan Pickford has been fantastic for us but he should never have got involved in the free-kick and we found it hard chasing the game.\n\"We lost two players through injury which didn't help. We changed it at half-time but ultimately we needed to impose ourselves on Swansea. The first goal was the turning point.\"\nSwansea boss Paul Clement, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's a huge result for us. We've got ourselves into a strong position but the season is not over and we don't think it is done. Now have to look to next week.\n\"There's still one game to go. We'll be looking at the Crystal Palace-Hull game with a lot of interest but we can be happy with our work today.\n\"It was a bit of a messy second half but we got the job done.\"\nOn Kyle Naughton's goal: \"A lot of those go in our car park at the training ground. That goal was a great moment.\"\nSigurdsson... Llorente... goal - the stats you need to know\nSwansea ended a run of seven away Premier League games without a win to clinch their first victory since a 3-2 triumph at Anfield in January (D1 L6).\nThe Black Cats have failed to score in 19 Premier League games this season, more than any other side - they last failed to score in more in a league season in 2002-03 (20 games).\nEight of Sigurdsson's 13 assists in the Premier League this season have come from set plays, three more than any other player.\nLlorente has scored seven headed Premier League goals this season, more than any other player.\nSigurdsson has assisted six of Llorente's 14 Premier League goals this season - the most from one player to another.\nWhat next?\nSunderland have two games to go before they relinquish their Premier League status. They may well wish they did not as they travel to Arsenal on Tuesday (19:45 BST) before a final-day game at champions Chelsea (15:00 BST).\nSwansea's immediate focus will be on Hull's game at Palace on Sunday (12:00 BST).

Their late charge sees them maintain optimism of extending their Champions League participation to 22 consecutive seasons, and they have an FA Cup final against newly crowned Premier League champions Chelsea to look forward to.\nReaction: Wenger 'not influenced' by plane banner\nStoke potter in bottom half\nStoke's season is petering out with a whimper - they have won just one of their past 10 league games.\nThis loss means they will finish in the bottom half for the first time since 2012-13 - their worst season in the Premier League as they finished 13th with 42 points.\nAlthough the Potters are in the same position at the moment, they have one fewer point and will be hoping to win their last game of the season at Southampton to end on a high.\nEven after pulling a goal back against Arsenal - which should not have stood after Crouch's handball - Stoke did not look like getting anything out of the game with Mame Biram Diouf summing up their performance by nodding wide from just three yards out.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)\nOne goal and one assist, Sanchez is getting back to his best at the right time for Arsenal but handed the Gunners an injury scare by hobbling off shortly after his goal.\n'Suffer and stick together'\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We had a difficult week but we have won convincingly so the focus is there, the fighting spirit is there and we're pleased to win. I believe when the team plays well we have the right individual talent to win.\n\"When they scored the 'hand-goal' they came back but when you go to places like Stoke you need at some stage to suffer and stick together and that is what we did.\"\nStoke boss Mark Hughes: \"We had to chase to the game and we have been picked off going the opposite way. Playing for five minutes isn't enough. We needed to ask more questions.\n\"We are disappointed as it is always our aim [to finish in the top half of the table]. This is the first time we have missed out. We go against Southampton next week to get points on the board. In the summer we will assess things and maybe change things around.\"\nSanchez joins Arsenal greats - the stats\nStoke have shipped 24 goals at home this season - their joint-highest in a single Premier League campaign (same as 2015-16).\nArsenal have scored 4+ goals in five away league games this season. It's their most in a season since 1936-37 (also five).\nSanchez became the eighth player to score 50 Premier League goals for Arsenal, with only Thierry Henry (83 games) and Ian Wright (87) reaching the milestone faster than the Chilean (101).\nSanchez is also the first player to record double figures for both goals (21) and assists (10) in the Premier League this season.\nThe South American also scored his 15th away goal in the Premier League this season - only Kevin Phillips (16 in 1999-00) has scored more in a single campaign.\nPeter Crouch scored his ninth Premier League goal against Arsenal - more than he has against any other opponent in the competition.\nOnly Wayne Rooney (11) and Robbie Fowler (10) have scored more against the Gunners in the competition.\nSince the start of last season, only Ozil (31) and Sanchez (25) have recorded more assists for Arsenal in all competitions than Hector Bellerin (13), with the Spaniard picking up two today."

He was named manager of the month for August.\nHowever, the season quickly unravelled with Hull winning just one of the next 18 league games before Phelan was sacked on 3 January.\nThe Tigers were also rocked by the loss of \u00a310m midfield summer signing Ryan Mason to a fractured skull after clashing heads with Chelsea's Gary Cahill.\nThen Robert Snodgrass, who remains the club's leading league scorer this season with seven goals, joined West Ham for \u00a310.2m.\nSilva took over with the club rooted to the foot of the table and despite six wins in eight home games, the Portuguese failed to mastermind an away win in nine attempts.\nPalace turn on the style to confirm survival\nThree straight defeats had left Palace's top-flight place up in the air, but there was never any doubt about the outcome of this game once Zaha pounced on Ranocchia's mistake to score Palace's quickest league goal for three years.\nThe on-loan defender from Inter Milan completely missed a straightforward clearance and Zaha kept his composure to net his seventh in the league this season.\nPalace then built on their lead when Benteke rose inside the six-yard area to power Jason Puncheon's header into the net.\nThe visitors were denied a penalty when Puncheon appeared to handle inside his own penalty area before two late goals sealed Hull's fate.\nBut Referee Martin Atkinson did point to the spot when Michael Dawson marked his return by sending Jeffrey Schlupp sprawling inside the area which allowed Milivojevic to make it 3-0.\nHull, who have the league's worst defence, were completely overrun and it went from bad to worse for the visitors, with Van Aanholt finding the net after latching onto James McArthur's pass.\nMan of the match - Jason Puncheon (Crystal Palace)\n'We failed in our target' - manager reaction\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"It's always a relief.

We did our best to improve the boys in the team and that was our job.\"\nHull City captain Michael Dawson: \"It is very hard. The season has been a long, hard slog and it is a sad day.\n\"You work hard all year and then you get relegated, you have to pick yourselves up and we know what to do in the Championship.\n\"Marco Silva has done a fantastic job since he came in.

At the end it was amazing but the start was not that good.\n\"We scored some really nice goals but in the first half West Ham had big, big chances - especially to equalise before half-time.\n\"It was really unlucky for West Ham, but it was really lucky from our position. West Ham have not had too much luck this season.\nOn the final game of the season against Middlesbrough, Klopp added: \"Middlesbrough have nothing to lose but we have everything to lose.\n\"The first thing the boys said in the dressing room - and I didn't have to tell them - was 'one more game'.\n\"If we win we deserve to be in the Champions League. If not we don't deserve it.\"\nLiverpool love the capital - stats you need to know\nLiverpool have now won at 52 different grounds in the Premier League, more than any other side in the competition (Arsenal and Manchester United next on 50).\nWest Ham suffered their joint-worst home defeat in the Premier League, losing by a four-goal margin for the third time this season (also 1-5 v Arsenal and 0-4 v Manchester City).\nThe Reds have won four of five four Premier League games in London this season (drew one), going unbeaten in the capital across an entire league season for the first time since in 1988-89.\nThis is the first time since 1998-99 that the Hammers have conceded four or more goals in four different home games in a single league season.\nPhilippe Coutinho was directly involved in three goals in a single game for Liverpool for the first time (two goals and one assist).\nAll three of Philippe Coutinho's Premier League braces have come in London (also v Chelsea in Oct 2015 and Arsenal in Aug 2016).\nLiverpool's 11 shots on target were the most that West Ham have faced in a Premier League game this season and the most since November 2015 (v Tottenham, 12).\nWhat's next?\nWest Ham finish their season away at Burnley at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 21 May while Liverpool host Middlesbrough needing three points to guarantee Champions League football in 2017-18."

It came after 22 minutes before he then gifted Watford's Etienne Capoue an instant equaliser with a poor header.\nCesar Azpilicueta restored Chelsea's lead with a crisp finish before half-time and the contest looked over when Michy Batshuayi, who scored the title-winning goal at West Bromwich Albion on Friday, added a third just after the break.\nWatford, however, showed commendable fight. Daryl Janmaat's fine solo effort put the visitors within reach before substitute Stefano Okaka, who was given his Italy debut by Chelsea boss Conte, took advantage of defensive uncertainty to slam in an equaliser.\nChelsea, as so often this season, found a way to win as substitute Cesc Fabregas struck from the edge of the area with three minutes left - while Watford's misery was compounded when Sebastian Prodl was sent off for a second yellow card in stoppage time.\nTerry could retire after Chelsea exit\nReaction to Chelsea's 4-3 win over Watford\nNevin: We've only scratched the surface with Conte\nConte celebrates title and plans for Wembley\nConte can do no wrong and he was being cheered at Stamford Bridge within seconds of appearing in his technical area after winning the Premier League at the first time of asking.\nThis was a night for Chelsea to bask in the glory of their success and hard work this season, and after a slow start, the crowd warmed to the occasion.\nFor Conte, it was also the opportunity to give some of his shadow squad game time, with the likes of Thibaut Courtois and Nemanja Matic given the night off and Diego Costa, Fabregas, Pedro, Gary Cahill and Marcos Alonso on the bench.\nIt was not simply a matter of giving Terry a game and showcasing younger talent such as Nathan Ake and Nathaniel Chalobah - this was a selection with a glance towards the forthcoming FA Cup final against Arsenal at Wembley.\nChelsea's lack of familiarity showed in an uncharacteristically shoddy defensive performance while the lack of spark in some of the display was perhaps the result of mental and physical energy expended in getting the title win over the line.\nThe perfectionist Conte will be unhappy with parts of this performance, but he will also see the bigger picture.\nMixed fortunes for Terry\nTerry is on the victory lap of his Chelsea career, with only Sunday's final home game against Sunderland remaining before the curtain comes down.\nChelsea's title win enabled Conte to give Terry his first league start since the 2-2 draw at Swansea City on 11 September last year, and first start in any competition since the FA Cup fifth-round win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 18 February.\nIt was a night of mixed fortunes for the 36-year-old, whose goal meant he had scored in his 17th successive Premier League season.\nTerry scrambled home that landmark goal but then made that uncharacteristic error to allow Capoue in for the equaliser.\nChelsea's defence was not at its best but Terry was leading from the front as usual, even diving into an injury-time melee when players from both sides squared up to each other.\nTerry is not going quietly from Chelsea - but that will come as no surprise.\nAzpilicueta the unsung hero\nIt was fitting that Azpilicueta got himself on the scoresheet with a drilled low finish to put Chelsea 2-1 up - a rightful reward for a player whose outstanding consistency makes him a key component of this title-winning team.\nAzpilicueta has been almost faultless as a vital part of the three-man defence that transformed Chelsea's season, and while he may be underrated and unsung outside Stamford Bridge, there is no underestimating the importance Conte, his team-mates and fans put on the 27-year-old Spain defender.\nMan of the match - Willian\n'The target is 30 wins' - what the managers said\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte told BBC Sport: \"It's a big night because we won the title. I made a decision to make nine changes and give the chance to start a lot of young players. I must be pleased because the answer was very good.\n\"We conceded three goals but we scored four and created many chances. The most important thing was we won. Now we have target to win 30 games [which would be a Premier League record in a season].\n\"The most important thing is to win the league. Then if we have the possibility to improve these records, we must try. We can reach this target. The players and I want to reach this target.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri told BBC Sport: \"I am very proud of my team. We had several players out injured.\n\"We played very well. Of course we were safe with six games left. I'm looking at the players I've got and who needs to be here next season.\n\"Congratulations to Antonio Conte because he's a great manager. They have great players. They deserve the title.\"\nWhat's next?\nChelsea get to celebrate all over again when they host relegated Sunderland on Sunday (15:00 BST), while Watford welcome Manchester City at the same time on the final day of the league season. The Blues still have the FA Cup final against Arsenal to come on 27 May.\n1,000 goals under Abramovich - match stats\nChelsea have equalled the record from most wins in a single Premier League season [29, also achieved by the Blues in 04-05 and 05-06]\nWatford scored with all three of their shots on target\nAntonio Conte made nine changes to the starting 11 for this game, the most ever by a Chelsea manager in the Premier League\nJose Holebas has picked up a league-high 14 yellow cards in the Premier League this season; no player has ever picked up more in a single campaign [also 14 for Lee Cattermole in 14-15, Cheick Tiote in 10-11, Robbie Savage in 01-02 and Mark Hughes in 98-99)\nJohn Terry has now netted in each of his past 17 top-flight campaigns\nTerry's goal was Chelsea's 1,000th in the Premier League since Roman Abramovich took over [in the summer of 2003]\nIt was also the Blues' 100th goal in all competitions this season"

        "article_text": "Arsenal 2-0 Sunderland\nArsenal ensured the race to finish in the Premier League's top four will go down to the final day of the season with a laboured win against relegated Sunderland.\nAlexis Sanchez tapped in Mesut Ozil's square pass to the relief of those inside a sparsely populated Emirates Stadium.\nAs Arsenal increased in urgency, Sanchez bundled in Olivier Giroud's cut-back to renew their hopes of a top-four finish for a 21st successive season.\nDespite having 36 attempts at goal - the most in a Premier League game since 2003 - the Gunners could not wipe out fourth-placed Liverpool's superior goal difference.\nArsenal are a point behind the Reds - who are two goals better off - before Sunday's final matches.\nRealistically, Arsene Wenger's men must beat seventh-placed Everton and hope the Reds slip up against relegated Middlesbrough at Anfield.\nPatience pays off for Arsenal\nArsenal started the evening needing to win - preferably by a big margin - if they were to have any realistic hope of sneaking into the top four.\nThey knew defeat against rock-bottom Sunderland, who had managed just three away victories all season, would end their hopes if Manchester City beat West Brom.\nAnd with City cruising to a 3-1 win in their game, even a draw would have left Arsenal struggling.\nUntil Sanchez's late intervention, it looked as though Wenger's side would be left frustrated by a lack of conviction in front of goal and some stubborn Sunderland defending.\nThe Gunners found the breakthrough with 20 minutes left, Granit Xhaka picking out Ozil with a clever chip over the defence that was put back across goal by the German for Sanchez to tap in.\nArsenal knew just a draw against Everton on the final day might be enough to catch Liverpool if they wiped out the Reds' superior goal difference, and Wenger urged his side to push for more goals from the touchline.\nSanchez was lurking in the six-yard box at the right time to convert Giroud's volleyed pass to double the lead, but despite a late flurry that saw Shkodran Mustafi hit the woodwork the hosts were unable to add to their tally.\n\"Sunderland did fight and that's what you want from every team,\" Wenger said.\nEmpty Emirates illustrates Arsenal apathy\nArsenal have endured a turbulent season blighted by confusion over Wenger's future, protests from supporters demanding change and concerns that Sanchez and Ozil may be sold this summer.\nSwathes of empty red seats at a hushed Emirates Stadium illustrated the apathy of some Gunners fans, the subdued atmosphere compounded by Arsenal failing to make their early dominance count.\nThe Gunners created 18 efforts in a frustrating first half, only to be let down by wayward finishing and another impressive display by Black Cats goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\nThe 23-year-old boosted his burgeoning reputation with several instinctive saves after the break as Arsenal continued to pile on the pressure before Sanchez's late double.\nHowever, creeping past an already-relegated side is unlikely to appease the unhappy Arsenal fans who believe Wenger is not the man to take them forward.\nWenger's contract expires at the end of the season and, although the club has offered him a two-year deal, he again refused to answer questions about his future after the match.\nSome hope for Sunderland?\nSunderland manager David Moyes has endured a miserable debut season with the Black Cats, even agreeing with former England captain Alan Shearer's scathing assessment that the performance of his players in Saturday's defeat against Swansea was \"disgraceful\".\nThe Black Cats, who were relegated with four games to go, are likely to undergo major surgery in the summer with many players out of contract and some - notably Pickford and striker Jermain Defoe - likely to be targeted by Premier League clubs.\nBut those players who have been heavily criticised did manage to salvage a modicum of pride at Arsenal.\nSunderland defended doggedly and even threatened to cause the Gunners some defensive problems, most notably when Didier Ndong and Defoe drew saves from Petr Cech before the break.\nAnd the Black Cats were almost gifted the lead at the start of the second half when Nacho Monreal's howler of backpass had to be scooped wide by Cech.\nThey could not capitalise on an indirect free-kick inside the Gunners six-yard box as their winless Premier League run at the Emirates extended to a 17th game.\nMan of the match - Jordan Pickford (Sunderland)\nPost-match reaction\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger:\n\"We had plenty of shots on goal but we needed to be patient. We were frustrated at half-time not to be leading.\n\"We made 71 points and were second. We now have 72 and want to go to 75. After that you deal with what happens.\n\"We've got in on the final day many times. Sunderland fought and you want that in the Premier League - that's what you want from every team.\n\"We had a difficult patch after the Bayern game because it was difficult to recover. On the other hand it was a good mental test and we responded in a strong way.\"\nSunderland manager David Moyes:\n\"We were full of character and commitment. We made it difficult for Arsenal for long periods and had good chances. We played well but Arsenal had the class to make the difference.\n\"Saturday's game against Sunderland was not like I'd seen in the last month or so. Against Arsenal we got a good performance and if we got the first goal it could have been completely different.\n\"After I got in in August I didn't think we had a squad capable. But it was what we've got, you have to try and ultimately we were just short.\n\"I'll speak with chairman Ellis Short over the next few days. I've given him an indication of what we need to do and we'll look to see if that's possible.\"\nAnalysis\nFormer England captain Trevor Brooking on BBC Radio 5 live:\n\"Alexis Sanchez is priceless, they must not let him go.\n\"But it took a long time for Arsenal to get that first goal. If they got that after half an hour then we would have probably had four or five.\"\nEx-Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson on BBC Radio 5 live:\n\"I think Arsene Wenger has been great for them but it's just time to say goodbye.\n\"But I think he will sign for another two years.\"\nWhat's next?\nThe final games of the season all kick off on Sunday at 15:00 BST. Arsenal host seventh-placed Everton at Emirates Stadium, while Sunderland wave farewell to the Premier League - for one season at the very least - with a trip to champions Chelsea.\nWenger gets the better of Moyes... again\nDavid Moyes has lost 16 times to Arsene Wenger in the Premier League, his most defeats against another manager in the competition\nWenger secured his 20th victory in all competitions against Moyes, more than any other manager he has faced with Arsenal\nNo side has finished bottom of the Premier League on more occasions than Sunderland (three, level with Nottingham Forest)\nAlexis Sanchez has scored six goals in five Premier League games versus Sunderland\nSanchez has been directly involved in 33 Premier League goals this season (23 goals, 10 assists), more than any other player\nSince his Premier League debut in September 2013, Mesut Ozil has provided more assists than any other player (41)\nArsenal have never lost a home Premier League match against Sunderland, winning 11 and drawing five"

        "article_text": "Manchester City 3-1 West Bromwich Albion\nManchester City clinched an emphatic win over West Brom to move back up to third place in the Premier League with one game remaining.\nA point in their final game at Watford on Sunday will now be enough to guarantee Pep Guardiola's side a place in the top four and Champions League football, while a win would see them finish third and go straight into the group stage.\nThis was as straightforward a victory as City could have anticipated at this stage of the season, as two goals in two first-half minutes put them in control against a Baggies side that lacked ambition and did not seriously threaten until the final stages.\nFirst, Sergio Aguero's flick fed Kevin de Bruyne, who burst into the left-hand side of the area before squaring the ball to give Gabriel Jesus an easy tap-in.\nOne minute and 46 seconds later it was 2-0, thanks to a brilliant first-time finish from De Bruyne after Aguero's attempt to tee up Jesus was cleared into the Belgian's path on the edge of the area.\nYaya Toure made it 3-0 after the break, exchanging passes with Aguero as he marched into the area to slot past Ben Foster.\nWest Brom managed a late consolation when substitute Hal Robson-Kanu turned in Allan Nyom's low cross.\nHow Man City could face a play-off against Arsenal or Liverpool\nRelive Man City's win against West Brom\nZabaleta bids Etihad Stadium farewell\nWith the points all but secured by Toure's goal, attention for many City fans switched to Pablo Zabeleta's big send-off.\nAfter nine years with City in which he won every domestic trophy, the 32-year-old Argentina defender is leaving the club at the end of the season.\nHe started on the bench but the home fans sang his name from kick-off, gave him his first standing ovation of the night in the first half and then exploded into noise when he began warming up.\nThe ground rose to applaud him on to the pitch when he replaced David Silva on the hour mark, and then cheered every time he touched the ball.\nZabaleta ended the game wearing the captain's armband after Vincent Kompany was substituted and West Brom's belated fightback never threatened to ruin his night.\nAfter an emotional farewell speech at the final whistle, when he was joined on the pitch by his wife and young son, Zabaleta was given a guard of honour by his team-mates as he and his family departed down the tunnel.\nMan of the match - Kevin de Bruyne\nGabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero were also strong candidates but the in-form Belgian edged it thanks to his assist for City's first goal and particularly his finish for their second. De Bruyne's form dipped in mid-season but he currently looks near to his best.\nWest Brom's form has dropped off a cliff\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who was hoping for a City slip here to allow his team back into the top four, had accused mid-table teams of being \"on holiday\"\n, external\nbefore the game.\nIf those comments were designed to sting the Baggies into life, they did not work.\nWest Brom's form has dropped off the proverbial cliff since they beat the Gunners at the Hawthorns at the end of March, and they never looked like reversing it here.\nYou could not accuse Tony Pulis' side of not trying at Etihad Stadium, but their effort was mostly defensive - even after they fell behind.\nDefeat stretched their winless run to eight games, a run in which they have scored only three goals and picked up two points.\nThey also drop one place to ninth - slipping below Southampton on goal difference - and the end of the season can seemingly not come quickly enough for them.\n'Maybe we can do better next season' - What they said\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It is in our hands to finish third so it is the best thing.\n\"To finish in front of Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, it means a lot. Maybe next season hopefully we can do better.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"They deserved to win tonight. Once they got their noses in front, they're a difficult team to pull back.\n\"The two quick-fire goals killed us. When the third one went in, you're looking down the barrel.\"\nStats - City's home comfort but Baggies miss out on record\nManchester City are now unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League home games, their longest run without defeat in the competition since a run of 37 home games from December 2010-December 2012 under Roberto Mancini.\nDefeat for West Brom means they will not be able to equal or better their previous best points haul in a Premier League season, which was 49 in 2012-13.\nNo midfielder has been involved in more Premier League goals than Kevin de Bruyne in 2016-17. His figure of 22 (six goals and 16 assists) is level with Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson and Tottenham's Dele Alli.\nGabriel Jesus has now scored six goals and provided assists for a further three in only seven Premier League starts for Manchester City.\nThe Brazilian is averaging a goal or an assist every 62 minutes in the league this season, the best ratio of any player in the competition (minimum 500 minutes played).\nPablo Zabaleta made his 117th and final Premier League appearance at Etihad Stadium, the most of any outfield player for City.\nWhat's next?\nCity finish their season against Watford at Vicarage Road on Sunday (15:00 BST), at the same time West Brom wrap theirs up with a trip to Wales to play Swansea."

They are one point ahead of West Brom in ninth and Bournemouth in 10th. Leicester, who are three points behind in 11th, have a game in hand against Tottenham on Thursday.\nBut with a League Cup final appearance under his belt, the 55-year-old Puel could have done enough to earn another season at St Mary's.\nMourinho sticks to his word\nUnder Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United did not finish outside of the top three in the Premier League era, but since his departure in 2013 United have not finished inside the top three.\nIt will also be the first time that current boss Mourinho has finished lower than third in his managerial career.\nMourinho made clear in recent weeks that his focus is firmly on winning the Europa League and securing Champions League qualification next season.\nFollowing consecutive league defeats by Arsenal and Tottenham, he made four changes against Saints and had youngsters Demetri Mitchell and Scott McTominay on the substitutes' bench.\nHis side were once again lacklustre against Southampton and they would have slipped to a third consecutive league defeat had it not been for Argentine goalkeeper Romero.\nOne downside for Mourinho was that the sight of midfielder Marouane Fellaini limping off after 75 minutes.\nDe Gea will play for Man Utd again - Mourinho\nWhile Romero will play in goal in the Europa League final, Mourinho also confirmed that third-choice goalkeeper Joel Pereira will make his Premier League debut against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\nInjured David de Gea did not travel with the squad to Southampton, but when asked about the Spaniard's future, Mourinho said the 26-year-old will play for the club again.\n\"He'll play the first match against LA Galaxy in pre-season in Los Angeles,\" he said.\n\"I hope to play Sergio in the final and hopefully we don't have problems with the keepers. David is top of the world and obviously we want to keep the top in the world.\"\nMan of the match - Sergio Romero\nWhat they said\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel said: \"We can feel shame after this game because we had many opportunities in the second half.\n\"We had two different halves - the first one was without intensity and it was very difficult after the penalty because that would have given us the confidence.\n\"The second half was interesting as there was quality and many chances without a good reward.\n\"But this point is important for us in the table.\"\nWhen asked about his future, Puel said: \"I think it's important to stay focused on the last game and to finish strong. After the last game it is normal to have a discussion about the season.\"\nOne shot on target for Man Utd - stats you need to know\nManchester United have drawn 15 league games this season - their most ever in a Premier League season and most in a league campaign since 1991-92 (also 15).\nSouthampton had six shots on target - only Tottenham (seven on Sunday) have had more in a match against Manchester United this season in all competitions.\nHowever, that included a missed penalty which means Saints have now missed their last three Premier League spot kicks, after Dusan Tadic v Hull and Shane Long v Middlesbrough.\nSergio Romero became the eighth different United keeper to save a Premier League penalty, and first since David de Gea against Everton in October 2014.\nSouthampton have now gone four top-flight home games without a goal for the first time in their history.\nEven if United win their remaining game, this will be their lowest tally of wins in a single Premier League season (currently 17). They last had fewer in 1990-91 (16 wins).\nWhat's next?\nSouthampton host Stoke City on the final day of the season on Sunday while Manchester United host Crystal Palace at Old Trafford (both 15:00 BST).\nJose Mourinho's side then travel to Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax on Wednesday, 24 May (19:45 BST)."

But, while the league has failed to deliver the close title race the television schedulers were hoping for, no blame can be attached to Tottenham.\nSpurs have won 12 of their past 13 league games and have been kept at bay only by the remarkable resilience of Chelsea, who ensured it has been a case of 'nearly' for Pochettino and his players for the second season in a row.\nThird last season despite being Leicester's closest challengers in the second half of the campaign - or, as the home fans enjoyed chanting in the opening stages, \"third in a two-horse race\" - Spurs have gone one better this time. Much better, in fact.\nThis dominant win took them past Leicester's title-winning haul of 81 points, and they have enough on the board to have won the Premier League on eight previous occasions - with a game still to come.\nSon's superb strikes mean that - for the first time in the club's history - they have three players who have scored 20 goals in a season, and took them beyond 75 league goals for the first time since 1984-85.\nAdd in the division's meanest defence - Hugo Lloris' mistake for Chilwell's goal notwithstanding - and it is no surprise Pochettino has committed his future to the club.\nDo Spurs have enough?\nAs White Hart Lane is dismantled and rebuilt, Spurs' summer seems likely to be flavoured by reports and fears of the team going the same way.\nRight-back Kyle Walker - again left out, albeit this time with an ankle problem - has long been linked\n, external\nwith a move, and Pochettino admitted this week the club may struggle to compete with clubs offering huge salaries this summer.\nThat may have sounded alarm bells for supporters, but the good news for them is it would surely take record numbers to prise away either of the side's crown jewels.\nKane and Alli have scored 43 Premier League goals between them this season and were outstanding again, along with Son, in a dynamic attacking display.\nThose three players alone had 19 efforts on goal, while Alli's chipped assist for Son's first goal was further evidence of his growing influence and inventiveness.\nKane, who tapped in Son's cross to open the scoring, added a close-range header then twice thrashed past Kasper Schmeichel from the edge of the area, could become the first man since Robin van Persie to win the golden boot in successive seasons.\nThere is no doubt Spurs have the quality to be champions. If they can repeat their home form while on 'holiday' at Wembley, perhaps the wait for a league title will end after 57 years.\nStage set for Shakespeare's second act?\nShakespeare said this week he expects to find out if he will remain in charge of the Foxes \"within days\".\nHe has certainly made a strong case to be retained, but his side's second-half capitulation must be a disappointment, particularly as a comeback briefly looked possible when Chilwell scored his first career goal, prodding in after Jamie Vardy had gone around an out-of-position Lloris.\nA second big decision of the season now looms for the Leicester hierarchy, who were widely criticised for sacking Claudio Ranieri in February, just months after he delivered the title.\nThey must surely consider themselves vindicated, despite such a heavy defeat. The Foxes were one point above the relegation zone when Shakespeare took over with 13 matches left but survived easily thanks to seven wins in Shakespeare's 12 league games.\nIn fact, had the season begun when he took over, Leicester would once again be dreaming of Europe.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane\nKane up there with the greats\nKane is the fifth player in Premier League history to score 25+ goals in successive seasons (Robbie Fowler, Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer and Robin van Persie are the others).\nKane has now scored more club goals against Leicester than any other side (10).\nKane is the fifth different player to score three or more hat-tricks in a Premier League season.\nTottenham now have three players with 20 or more goals in all competitions this season (Kane, Alli & Son); more than any other club in the Premier League or Football League.\nThis is the joint-heaviest defeat in Premier League history for a reigning champion (also Manchester United's 6-1 loss to Manchester City in October 2011).\nLeicester have now lost 18 league games this season, the most by a reigning top-flight champion since Ipswich Town in 1962-1963 (19)\nLeicester had let in two goals in their previous five home games under Shakespeare.\nWhat's next?\nShakespeare has one final home game to impress as Leicester host Bournemouth, while Tottenham wrap up their campaign at relegated Hull. All Premier League games on Sunday, 21 May kick off at 15:00 BST."

Lose and it means another season out of Europe's elite club competition.\nBut their fine cup form has been in contrast to a forgettable top-flight campaign in which they have claimed their fewest Premier League victories (18) and most draws (15) - including 11 at Old Trafford.\nTheir patchy performances at home also meant they collected one more point on the road - 35 - than they did on their own turf.\nBut they finished with a flourish, with a number of youngsters being given their debuts, including Harrop, Gomes, goalkeeper Joel Pereira, left-back Demetri Mitchell and midfielder Scott McTominay.\nIt was a particularly memorable one for Stockport-born Harrop, who scored a superb opening goal. He said afterwards: \"It was an amazing afternoon. I have dreamed of that moment so many times so I cannot believe it came true.\n\"I have to thank Mourinho for giving me the opportunity to play.\"\nAnalysis\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone at Old Trafford:\nThat 90 minutes couldn't have gone much better for Jose Mourinho and Manchester United. A comfortable win, a goal for Paul Pogba, no injuries and debuts for five youngsters.\nThe major talking point is what happens to Wayne Rooney. Substituted to a standing ovation near the end, Rooney led the post-match 'lap of appreciation' accompanied by his three children. There was nothing unusual in that, nor the wave he gave to both sides of the ground as his number went up to be replaced, given United were coasting to victory at the time.\nBut if it proves to be his last competitive appearance for United at Old Trafford, it was rather subdued, and somewhat at odds with the way he began, lashing home that wonderful hat-trick on his debut against Fenerbahce in 2004.\nThat remains one of Rooney's top three Old Trafford moments. The others? The 'angry' volley against Newcastle in 2006 and that staggering overhead kick against Manchester City in 2011.\nHello, goodbye - Mourinho's 20-second news conference\nJose Mourinho did fulfil his media obligations after today's game - but it wasn't very enlightening. He went through the TV area as his team were on their lap of appreciation, and before the crews had chance to get down and ask him a question.\nMourinho then headed straight to the conference room underneath the main stand, where about four members of the media were present as the remainder were watching Rooney and his team-mates make their way around the ground, some trying to work out if the United manager was actually with them.\nThe Portuguese sat down, United's media officer asked if there were any questions, none were forthcoming, Mourinho said \"good\", stood up, added \"bye guys\" and was gone. Those who saw him leave reckoned he was out of the ground by 17:15.\nAllardyce does his job\nThis game came a year to the day since the two sides met in the FA Cup final at Wembley, with Palace losing 2-1 in extra-time.\nThey will just be relieved that this difficult season in which they flirted with the prospect of relegation to the Championship has drawn to a close with them still in the top flight.\nBoss Sam Allardyce replaced Alan Pardew in December with the Eagles 17th in the table, his first job since an ill-fated one-game spell as England manager.\nIt took the former West Ham, Blackburn and Sunderland manager six games to claim his first victory, but eight wins from his 21 games in charge guaranteed another season in the top flight.\nThe Londoners barely created any chances against United and the damage was done early on as they conceded two goals in the opening period, with the two sides taking a more leisurely approach in the second half.\nAttention will now turn to bolstering the squad in the summer and they will be hoping to prevent bigger clubs from signing key players such as winger Wilfried Zaha and striker Benteke.\nMan of the match - Josh Harrop (Manchester United)\nAn unforgettable debut for the United youngster, capped off by a goal.\n'Let me go home'\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho tells MUTV: \"Don't ask me too many things because now I am in the final, let me go home.\"\nAsked if he knew his team, he replied: \"I know, but let me go.\"\nCrystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"We have all worked extremely hard, from the owners' support throughout the whole football club. My job was to lift everyone on the pitch and behind the scenes and get them working in the right direction. With the investment in January, very, very, very good performances came and that is why we stayed in the Premier League.\n\"Beating Chelsea away, Arsenal at home and Liverpool away in the space of a few days, had we not got [those wins] we would have been relegated. They were the big ones.\n\"We now need to grow, develop and invest. You need to choose the right players and not the wrong ones. Recruitment is the difficult task in the summer. Any players we bring in have to be better than the ones we have now.\"\nOne to seven for United - the stats\nJosh Harrop became the 100th player to score a Premier League goal for Manchester United.\nPaul Pogba netted his first Premier League goal since December by scoring in this game.\nThe Frenchman has scored and assisted in two Premier League games this season, the home and away games against Crystal Palace.\nThe Eagles have lost 13 times to Manchester United in the Premier League, more than any other side they have faced.\nManchester United have played Crystal Palace 16 times in the Premier League and have never lost (won 13, drawn three), their joint-most against a team without defeat (also Charlton).\nManchester United have now finished in each spot from first to seventh in a Premier League season, the only team to do this. They never finished lower than third under Sir Alex Ferguson, but have now ended seventh, fourth, fifth and sixth in the last four seasons."

        "article_text": "Watford 0-5 Manchester City\nManchester City sealed their place in next season's Champions League by crushing Watford to finish third in Pep Guardiola's debut season.\nCity skipper Vincent Kompany was left unmarked to head in an early opener before Sergio Aguero twice clinically fired in after quick counter-attacks.\nThe Blues, needing a point to guarantee a finish in the top four, were 4-0 up at half-time after Fernandinho bundled in.\nGabriel Jesus clipped in a fifth after the break as Watford ended the reign of departing manager Walter Mazzarri with a shocking display.\nMazzarri, who leaves after just one season, was booed by some Hornets fans during the game as the hosts suffered a sixth successive defeat to finish in 17th place.\nFollow all the reaction from the Premier League final day\nGuardiola delivers minimum requirement\nGuardiola is one of the most celebrated coaches in world football and joined City, when he succeeded Manuel Pellegrini last summer, with high expectations after success-packed spells at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.\nThe 46-year-old former Spain midfielder led Barca to 14 trophies - including three league titles and two Champions Leagues - in four years, then guided Bayern to league titles in each of his three seasons in Germany.\nHowever, his debut season in England has not ended in trophy presentations and victory parades.\nCity fans hoped his arrival would produce their first Premier League title in three years, but, despite winning their opening six games, they have faced a tense battle to finish in the top four.\nFew would have predicted that direct qualification into the Champions League would only be sealed on the final day, as his side held off Liverpool and Arsenal.\nIn the end, there was little cause for concern in a routine victory.\nCity were imperious from the opening whistle, easily finding space and clinically finishing their chances against hapless Watford, who were without six recognised centre-backs through either injury or suspension.\nThe Blues have now reached the Champions League for a sixth successive season - and are hoping for an improved showing under Guardiola next season.\n\"Next season I can assure you we will come back stronger,\" said Guardiola, who finished outside of a league's top two for the first time in his managerial career.\nWill Aguero and Toure stay or go?\nSo how will Guardiola look to improve this City squad next season? It is a question he was not willing to answer in his post-match interviews.\nSeveral players - notably Yaya Toure, Pablo Zabaleta, Jesus Navas and Bacary Sagna - are out of contract in the summer, while there are still question marks over Aguero's future.\nAguero has proved to be one of City's all-time greatest players since his \u00a338m arrival from Spanish side Atletico Madrid in 2011, scoring 179 goals in 253 appearances to help the Blues win two Premier League titles and two League Cups.\nIt seems unthinkable that they might be willing to let him leave - especially after a performance like this at Watford.\nThe 28-year-old Argentina striker was irrepressible. His movement constantly stretched the Watford defence, creating chances for himself and the team, and his own chances were sealed by trademark clinical finishing.\nAguero, whose second took him to 20 league goals for a third consecutive Premier League season, was denied the chance to complete his hat-trick when he was substituted in the 71st minute to a rousing ovation from the away fans.\nThose supporters must surely be hoping it was not a final farewell to a club legend.\n'Surviving' not good enough for Watford\nWatford have shown glimpses of their potential this season, most notably a home win against Manchester United, but those moments have been few and far between under departing manager Mazzarri.\nThe Italian, whose exit after just one season in charge was announced last week, insisted he had achieved his objective this season - keeping the Hornets in the top flight.\nHowever, Watford chairman Scott Duxbury clearly disagrees.\n\"We have aspiration and ambition. There have been some pundits lately saying we should just be happy with just surviving and the crumbs of the Premier League table,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live earlier on Sunday.\n\"I'm sorry but we want more than to survive.\"\nBefore Mazzarri's dismissal was announced, reports suggested he had fallen out with some players - including captain Troy Deeney - while some fans were concerned his lack of English meant he struggled to communicate with his squad.\nThe Italian was greeted by some angry supporters when he arrived at Vicarage Road before kick-off, and many chanted for him to be sent off when he was reprimanded by referee Kevin Friend in the second half.\nHis sacking one season into a three-year contract means the Hornets are looking for their eighth manager in five years since the Pozzo family took control of the club.\nMan of the match - Sergio Aguero (Man City)\n'The manager needs to speak English' - post-match reaction\nWatford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes:\n\"It is important to speak English if you are a manager. They cannot pass on instructions to the players but he tried his best and we thank him for it.\n\"The club had to make a decision, and they did. The language didn't help him. We apologise for some of our mistakes - we can't just blame the manager.\"\nWatford manager Walter Mazzarri:\nI want to thank the fans because they were patient. They supported the players on the pitch. It was not easy.\n\"Look how many players were missing. When we had the full squad we were seventh, we reached 40 points with six games to go.\n\"We were missing six defenders today. This has never happened to me in my whole career.\n\"I had a lot of satisfaction in England this year. If there is a team that would make me competitive enough in the league I would consider staying.\"\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola:\n\"I was so happy with this season. We fought in all competitions and the only regret is that we did not fight until the end.\n\"We are so glad to be third because every season is tougher and tougher to reach the Champions League.\n\"The gap is too big so we need to play better - not work harder - to be closer to Chelsea and Spurs.\n\"This is one of the best groups I have coached. It has been a privilege to work with these guys.\"\nCity are top-four regulars... the stats\nManchester City have finished in the top four in the Premier League in seven consecutive seasons - the longest active streak of any team in the competition.\nThey recorded their 12th league away win - their joint-most in a single campaign (also 12 in 2001-02).\nAguero became the fifth player to score 20+ goals in three consecutive Premier League seasons (after Shearer, Henry, Van Nistelrooy and Kane).\nKevin de Bruyne has provided 18 assists this season after teeing up Kompany and Aguero's first. Only Thierry Henry in 2002-03 (20) and Mesut Ozil in 2015-16 (19) have made more assists in a season.\nGabriel Jesus has had a hand in 11 goals in eight Premier League starts for City (seven goals, four assists).\nWatford suffered their joint-heaviest league defeat (also 5-0 v Wimbledon in December 1999 and 6-1 v Liverpool in November 2016).\nThe Hornets conceded 23 league goals from crosses this season, more than any other side."

        "article_text": "Liverpool 3-0 Middlesbrough\nLiverpool secured their Champions League return as their initial nerves turned to jubilation and relegated Middlesbrough crumbled at Anfield.\nWith top-four rivals Arsenal ahead at Everton, Liverpool were impotent in attack and twitchy at the back for most of the first half.\nBut Georginio Wijnaldum eased the tension in injury time, bursting into the box and smashing in a fierce shot at the near post.\nPhilippe Coutinho's low curling free-kick six minutes into the second half was quickly followed by Adam Lallana slotting in to give the Reds a comfortable cushion to ride out to full-time.\nWith Manchester City thrashing Watford, Liverpool finished fourth in the final Premier League table and will have to negotiate Champions League qualifying at the start of next season.\nA season in microcosm\nManager Jurgen Klopp had a beaming smile on the final whistle as he congratulated his players, but his team's display - in front of a watching owner John W Henry - underlined the need for further investment as they prepare to step up to Europe's top table for the first time since 2014-15.\nThat campaign ended in the group stages as Brendan Rodgers' side - with talisman Luis Suarez sold to Barcelona - were found wanting.\nIf they play like they did in Sunday's first half, the same fate will be the best this version can hope for.\nAs so often this season, Liverpool's attackers seemed stumped by deep-lying opposition and the soft centre of their defence was nearly exposed when Patrick Bamford got the wrong side of Dejan Lovren and had a strong claim for a penalty denied.\nBut Wijnaldum's powerful opener changed the mood both in the stands and on the pitch. The interplay between Roberto Firmino, Coutinho and Lallana in the second half was close to the scintillating best that they have produced in this campaign.\nThey surely need additions to recreate that form more consistently and on bigger stages next season, but Klopp's side collected an impressive 76 points and finished above Arsenal and Manchester United in his first full season in charge.\n\"I think it does qualify as a successful season. They set out to reach the Champions League and from a league point of view they've achieved that. They'll be bigger and better next season,\" Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said.\nNothing to discuss - Sturridge\nDaniel Sturridge is the last remaining part of the attacking trio that drove Liverpool close to the Premier League title two seasons ago.\nBut after an injury-blighted couple of campaigns and doubts over whether he can find a place in Klopp's high-tempo gameplan, it had been suggested he might follow Suarez and Raheem Sterling out of the club.\nStarting successive Premier League games for the first time since September, he added an extra dimension to Liverpool's play with clever movement, a constant penalty-box presence and ability to get a shot away.\nHe came closer than any Liverpool player to scoring in the first 45 minutes with a shot just wide, applauded the fans as he headed off with eight to go and exchanged an embrace with Klopp on his way to the bench.\n\"There is nothing to discuss really,\" he told Sky Sports, when asked after the match if he would still be at Liverpool next season. \"I have two years left on my deal and I am happy here.\"\nBoro concentrate on rebuilding job\nWhile Liverpool prepare for the Champions League, Middlesbrough have the different challenge of life in the Championship next season.\nChairman Steve Gibson has been bullish about the possibility of an immediate return, saying earlier in the week that he aimed to \"smash the league\" and return as champions.\nA starting selection without likely summer departures Alvaro Negredo, Marten de Roon and Adama Traore suggested that caretaker Steve Agnew is already concentrating on the next campaign.\nSolidly run off the pitch\n, external\nas well as resolute on it, Boro are well set to back up their chairman's promise, particularly if Gibson can convince his centre-back nephew Ben to stick with the club in the second tier.\nMan of the match - Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\n'A wonderful base for next season' - Klopp\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"We worked hard to get the first goal. We got more confident. We then scored from the free-kick and got even more confident.\n\"The boys then played some fantastic football. I'm really looking forward to next season. I think we have created a wonderful base. The better you're organised, the more you feel free to do special things in offence.\n\"I'm really happy about this - what a wonderful day.\"\nMiddlesbrough caretaker boss Steve Agnew: \"Liverpool have some top-class players and you wait for moments like that Patrick Bamford penalty shout and that did not go our way.\n\"It has been a difficult season and the bottom line is that we have not scored enough goals or won enough games. We need to use this summer to reflect and work out what we need to do to come back.\n\"The chairman is the best in my opinion and I'm sure that talks will be progressing over the next few weeks about the future of the club.\"\nO Magico pulls the strings - the stats you need to know\nLiverpool have finished in the top four of the Premier League for only the second time in the past eight seasons.\nPhilippe Coutinho has had a hand in 20 Premier League goals for Liverpool this season, more than any other player (13 goals, seven assists).\nCoutinho has scored 15 Premier League goals from outside the area, more than any other player.\nMiddlesbrough are one of three teams to visit Anfield on 10 or more occasions in the Premier League without winning (Sunderland - 16, Middlesbrough - 15 and Bolton - 13).\nAll 17 of Georginio Wijnaldum's Premier League goals have been scored in home games (six at Anfield and 11 at St James' Park).\nMiddlesbrough won just 28 points this season, their worst return in a Premier League season."

        "article_text": "Southampton 0-1 Stoke City\nSouthampton's miserable home form continued as Peter Crouch struck the only goal of the game to help Stoke to a first away win since January on the final day of the season.\nThe home side enjoyed the majority of possession but Nathan Redmond's lob on to the bar on the stroke of half-time was their best moment until Crouch pounced.\nThe striker's 10th goal of the season arrived when he headed home a Geoff Cameron cross and they deserved the lead after creating openings throughout.\nSouthampton rallied late on as Jack Butland produced fine saves to deny Steven Davis, James Ward-Prowse and Sofiane Boufal but Claude Puel's side end the campaign without a win in five games at St Mary's.\nThe Frenchman has been criticised by some supporters for a lack of entertainment in recent months and closing the season without a home league goal in over seven hours will do little to change such views.\nHis side end the season eighth, with their lowest points tally since 2012-13, while Stoke finish 13th, their lowest finish since the same season.\nFollow all the reaction from the Premier League final day\nFans flee sorry Saints\nPuel will now be one of the managers whose future is in the spotlight. His board have not leapt to his defence in recent weeks..\nBut he did guide Saints to the EFL Cup final - a first major final since 2003 - and they have not fallen lower than 13th in the table since October.\nGiven they lost central defensive partners Virgil van Dijk and Jose Fonte in January, to long-term injury and transfer respectively, perhaps such consistency merits greater praise.\nVan Dijk's future at the club will be resolved this summer, with high-profile clubs linked to him, while Ryan Bertrand's impressive campaign could also attract rivals.\nBut it is at the other end of the pitch where Saints fans will want reinforcements. Their side are the lowest scorers in the top half of the table and against Stoke that lack of cutting edge was clear.\nAlthough Redmond pounced when Butland lost possession to chip the keeper and hit the bar, it was only late on that the home side actually began to create chances for themselves. Manolo Gabiaddini wasted their best when Butland denied him one-on-one.\nPuel called the display a \"little picture of the season\" but declared himself \"satisfied with eighth. Though the customary end-of-season lap of honour was conducted in front of a stadium less than a third full.\nResistance and revolution for Stoke\nHughes will be thrilled at his 150th Premier League win as a manager - if only because it was just a second victory in 11 matches.\nBut his side looked well organised and used possession effectively, with Mame Biram Diouf seeing a shot saved and a header cleared off the line before the break.\nCrouch saw little of the ball - just 16 touches before he converted Cameron's pin-point cross - but when involved, his presence caused problems and only a last-ditch Maya Yoshida tackle denied him a chance in the first half.\nWith Wilfried Bony - who has not played since December - set to return to parent club Manchester City, the Potters will hope Saido Berahino can assist 36-year-old Crouch more ably next term. He is still waiting on a first goal for the club since joining from West Brom in January.\nThe club's board have promised to back Hughes in the transfer market,\n, external\nthough they may expect a better return than 13th after three ninth-placed finishes in a row.\nA better start will go a long way to help, as they played catch-up throughout the campaign having been winless in their first seven league games.\nBut after this deserved victory, Hughes emphasised that his side were just two points off eighth place and said he expects an \"evolution\" not \"revolution\" this summer.\nRetaining Butland looks a necessity and his double save to deny both Davis and Ward-Prowse to maintain the lead summed up the resistance Hughes needs to see more of in 2017-18.\nMan of the match - Jack Butland\nHughes joins elite club - the key stats\nPeter Crouch becomes the first player to score 50 headed Premier League goals.\nSouthampton have now failed to score in six of their last eight Premier League matches.\nThe Saints have failed to score in five consecutive home league games for only the second time in their history. They also did so in September 1937.\nMark Hughes becomes the seventh Premier League manager to notch 150 wins (Ferguson, Wenger, Redknapp, Moyes, Allardyce and Mourinho are the others).\nPuel satisfied with season - what the managers said...\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"To finish eighth is good. The game was a little picture of the season - many opportunities and possibilities without scoring.\n\"Sometimes there is disappointment because often there was good football without reward. I am satisfied for all this season.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We wanted to finish in the correct manner and I think it was a really honest performance. Jack made a couple of saves towards the end. We needed him to come to the fore and he did. That's what a top keeper does for you.\n\"If you look at where we finished, 13th, I think we are two points away from eighth. Fine margins. We will be better next year. It's not going to be revolution but evolution for us. There won't be wholesale changes.\""

He will now serve a suspension that will keep him out of the FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley.\nArsenal took the lead early on through Hector Bellerin's far-post finish and Alexis Sanchez scrambled in a second after Koscielny's dismissal to put the Gunners in control.\nIt was to no avail as Liverpool completed their task by beating Middlesbrough to finish fourth.\nThe Gunners did end the league campaign with a flourish though thanks to Aaron Ramsey's brilliant injury-time strike from 20 yards after Romelu Lukaku pulled a goal back for Everton from the penalty spot.\nThe hosts, who also had defender Gabriel taken off injured on a stretcher, now turn their attention to Wembley, after which an announcement on manager Wenger's future will be made.\nToo little, too late for Arsenal\nArsenal's failure to reach the Champions League will come as a seismic shock to a club that has made it their permanent home for the past two decades - but supporters will hope it acts as a wake-up call.\nThe Gunners have dropped away from the serious title challengers in recent years and the failure to make Europe's elite competition brings the recent decline under Wenger into sharper focus.\nArsenal cannot afford to be fooled by the recent improvement in performances or even if they win the FA Cup against Chelsea at Wembley.\nThere is still real talent within the team and the idea of losing talisman and inspiration Sanchez is unthinkable. But results have proved once more that they are nowhere near title-winning material and yet another exit at the last-16 stage of the Champions League is a brutal reflection of their wider status.\nIt now looks certain Wenger will be staying as manager and there can be no excuses for a disappointing league campaign.\nMild mutiny at Emirates Stadium\nArsenal's supporters set aside any discontent aimed at Wenger to give their side full support as they chased the unlikely possibility of a place in next season's Champions League.\nAnd it was only when news broke of Georginio Wijnaldum scoring for Liverpool against Middlesbrough at Anfield that the voices of rebellion were heard.\nIn the second half, loud chants of \"Stan Kroenke get out of our club\" echoed around Emirates Stadium in protest against the American owner who many Gunners fans feel has presided over Arsenal's recent relative fall from grace.\nThere was also a small number of protest banners unfurled after the final whistle as Arsenal's players waited to go on a lap of appreciation.\nIt was also done against the backdrop of Kroenke ignoring a \u00a31.3bn takeover bid from Arsenal's other main shareholder Alisher Usmanov, who holds a 30% stake in the club.\nAn appearance in the FA Cup final and the possibility of ending the season with a trophy has perhaps put serious protests on the back-burner - but there is still unhappiness lurking not far beneath the surface from a fan base who are demanding better.\n'Owner silence is deafening' - Analysis\nEx-Arsenal striker Ian Wright on Match of the Day\nThe boss is saying after the FA Cup final they will make an announcement on his future but he looked very despondent in his interview. We don't know what's happening.\nThe fans are protesting against the owner. I feel like his silence is deafening.\nFans would like that and for the owner to start backing the team. I would like Wenger to get backed more - I won't say he should go.\nKoeman has work to do\nEverton's form has fallen away badly since they secured Europa League qualification - a successful return for manager Ronald Koeman in his first season considering the fiasco he inherited from his predecessor Roberto Martinez.\nAnd the flaws he needs to address were all on show here, particularly in a desperate first 45 minutes which had an almost farcical air, with Everton defending appallingly and finishing equally badly when they were presented with acceptable chances.\nOne sub-plot to this finale was the subject of Ross Barkley's future as Koeman insists he must make a decision within days after rejecting a new contract.\nBarkley was dropped from Everton's starting line-up, with Koeman insisting his exclusion was purely tactical - although he was on for Tom Davies inside 26 minutes as they struggled to contain Arsenal.\nKoeman will have no hesitation in selling Barkley as he knows he needs to address several key areas of his team as well as await developments on the future of striker Lukaku.\nThe Toffees need a quality goalkeeper, reinforcements in central defence where Phil Jagielka and Ashley Williams were run ragged, more goals from midfield and help for Lukaku if he stays.\nKoeman will be heavily backed in the transfer market by major shareholder Farhad Moshiri who is fiercely ambitious, so this is shaping up as the most important summer in Everton's recent history.\nMan of the match - Alexis Sanchez\n'I've turned down every club in the world'\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It is annoying but we had a spell during the season that was difficult and it was difficult for me in my personal situation. We were playing in a hostile environment. The players came back stronger in the past two months and I'm very proud of them for doing that.\n\"I was focused on my job. I am professional. I love this club enough to do my best every single day. One thing you cannot question is my love for this club. I've turned down every club in the world to stay here.\"\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman: \"It wasn't good enough. We saw today what we need for the next season. We need more productivity out of possession. That's the difference between us and Arsenal.\n\"We did everything to win the game but we had to score in the first half. It was a long time 11 v 10 and a penalty isn't enough.\"\nArsenal's favourite opponents - the stats\nDespite victory, Arsenal have finished the season outside of the top four for the first time since the 1995-96 campaign, when they finished fifth under Bruce Rioch.\nEverton are now winless in their past 21 away league games against Arsenal, last beating them in London in January 1996 (2-1).\nThe Gunners have scored 95 Premier League goals against Everton - more than any club has against another in the competition's history.\nDanny Welbeck provided two assists in a single Premier League game for only the second time - the other was in April 2012 for Manchester United, also against Everton.\nLaurent Koscielny has been sent off five times since his Premier League debut in August 2010 - no player has been red carded more in that time [Tom Huddlestone and Younes Kaboul also five].\nKoscielny's red card was the second time he's been sent off in the opening 15 minutes of a Premier League game - the only player to have done so more than once [also sent off after nine minutes vs Manchester City in 2013].\nRomelu Lukaku scored his 25th Premier League goal of the season - the most goals scored without winning the Golden Boot since Wayne Rooney's 27 in 2011-12.\nThe Gunners have conceded 10 penalty goals this season, one of just two sides in Premier League history to ship double figures of goals from the spot [Hull, 11 also this season].\nWhat's next?\nArsenal have a Wembley date with Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup final. Everton and Ronald Koeman can now turn their attention to maintaining and building a squad for next season."

The game should have been out of sight for us at half-time, we had enough chances but they were the better team in the second half.\n\"The disappointment of today is tempered by the fact that we are still in the Premier League and that was always the aim. It is important we keep recruiting where we can and keep learning.\n\"It is an obvious challenge to keep what we have got and we will wait to see if we can do that. We have got better year on year, that is not just the players it is the staff. Recruitment is a big thing, to keep moving forward and we will be able to do that.\n\"It is a big achievement to stay in the Premier League and we have done that.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic said: \"We wanted to finish positive and we deserved to beat them. It is always nice to win the last game and I'm really pleased for the guys.\n\"We thought we were going to do better (this season), we had so many obstacles, so many injuries, so many surgeries, eight, which is not usual.\n\"The move to the stadium, which is the best thing the club has ever done long-term, it took us a while to settle. You need time. It is very hard to get that Upton Park feeling but it is going to get better and better.\n\"Today we showed character. We finished 11th and are one point from being eighth. It is not a season to talk about, to hail it, but it is not a very bad season. I'm expecting it to be better next season, of course.\n\"The summer will be busy for every club. Today's game showed we have a quantity of players and a squad. We were without eight players and still we had a good team out. We need a few players to improve our first team. Make no mistake our targets are also the targets for eight to ten clubs in the Premier League.\""

Coupled with Thursday's 6-1 thrashing by Spurs, the season's end will have done little to help his cause with the club's owners.\nForward steps for Bournemouth\nMeanwhile, Bournemouth fans will be reflecting on another year spent exceeding expectations.\nIn just their second season in England's top flight, Eddie Howe's entertaining and enterprising side scored more than 13 of their Premier League rivals - only the top five and seventh-placed Everton scored more.\nThere was a 4-3 win over Liverpool, a hugely entertaining 3-3 draw with Arsenal, and a dramatic 6-3 defeat by the Toffees on the way.\nJoshua King - left out of the squad at Leicester because of an ankle injury - top scored with 16 goals, while the ninth-place finish will pocket the club \u00a322.8m in prize money.\nWill the Cherries improve once again next season?\nThe \u00a36m header\nLeicester's 12th place will earn them \u00a317.1m in Premier League prize money, but had Vardy's goal counted - or Slimani not headed horribly wide - they might well have taken almost \u00a36m more.\nVictory over Bournemouth would have seen them climb above the south coast club and into ninth themselves, pocketing an extra \u00a35.7m.\nSecond season syndrome - the stats\nLeicester finished on 44 points, the lowest total of a reigning English top-flight champion since Liverpool in 1902 (42 points).\nBournemouth won 46 points, four more than they recorded last season.\nAfter winning his first five Premier League games in charge, Leicester boss Craig Shakespeare guided his side to just two victories the final eight matches.\nVardy scored eight goals in 13 Premier League games under Shakespeare, compared with five in 22 under Ranieri this season.\nMan of the match - Dan Gosling (Bournemouth)\n'My future? It's out of my hands'\nLeicester boss Craig Shakespeare: \"For the benefit of everybody it'll be sooner rather than later.\n\"When I get the phone call, then I'll know. I don't know when that'll be.

        "article_text": "Chelsea 5-1 Sunderland\nChampions Chelsea became the first English side to register 30 top-flight victories in a 38-game season as they said farewell to captain John Terry with a comfortable Premier League win over bottom club Sunderland.\nThe Blues, who sealed their sixth top-flight title nine days ago, fell behind to an early Javier Manquillo strike but hit back quickly through Willian's angled drive.\nEden Hazard lashed in his 17th goal of the season to give the home side the lead before his replacement, Pedro, capitalised on a poor backward header from Joleon Lescott to head in.\nAnother substitute, Michy Batshuayi, ensured the win was an emphatic one with two well-taken finishes late on to end his season with five goals in three games.\nIt was an emotional send-off for defender Terry, who left the field in tears to a guard of honour from his team-mates in a pre-planned substitution in the 26th minute, matching his shirt number.\nJermain Defoe missed what may well have been his last game as a Sunderland player with a hamstring injury as the Black Cats' 10-year stay in the Premier League came to an end with their 26th defeat of the season.\n26th-minute exit was my own idea - Terry\nRelive Chelsea's record-breaking victory over Sunderland\nThe final day of the 2016-17 Premier League season\nChelsea cap a superb season\nThe stats behind Chelsea's success this season are impressive: 30 wins in total, 15 victories in their last 16 at home, 83 points from the last 96 available to them and 85 goals scored, making this their second-best ever Premier League season in front of goal.\nAdmittedly, the Blues hugely underachieved during last season's title defence, but this has been an impressive and emphatic return to form for which Conte must take much of the credit.\nThe Italian has restructured the side, most notably through his adoption of a 3-4-3 formation in the aftermath of September's 3-0 loss at Arsenal, and restored their swagger - something that was fully evident in Sunday's final fixture.\nSunderland briefly went off script with Manquillo's opener - coming from a Seb Larsson free-kick - but once Willian had equalised there was only ever going to be one winner.\nPlaying within themselves, Chelsea were still way too good for the Black Cats, fashioning 28 shots to their opponents' seven. The only surprise was that they did not take more of them prior to the floodgates opening late on thanks to Hazard, Pedro and Batshuayi.\nThe latter's late-season contribution is further proof that all is well at Stamford Bridge right now. Restricted to cameo appearances for much of his first season in England, the Belgian striker has shown in the last three games he is capable of replacing Diego Costa, who continues to be linked with a summer move to China.\nThe Blues still have the chance to make Conte's debut season a Double-winning one when they take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley next Saturday.\nTerry says goodbye in style\nStamford Bridge was adorned with banners dedicated to captain Terry, many of them hailing him as the Blues' 'captain, leader and legend'.\nSince making his debut as a late substitute in a League Cup tie against Aston Villa in October 1998, the centre-back has become synonymous with the Blues, and in the Roman Abramovich era he has been their standout academy player among a raft of big-money recruits.\nHis 26th-minute substitution, which halted the game while he was given a guard of honour by his own team, was of his own design as a fitting way to say goodbye to the club that has been his home for 22 years.\nHis real parting moment, though, came after full-time when he and his natural successor as Blues captain, Gary Cahill, held aloft the Premier League trophy - the 15th major trophy the 36-year-old has won during his time at the club.\nAddressing the crowd, Terry said: \"Today is one of the most difficult days of my life.\n\"I've been very fortunate to work with some unbelievable players and managers throughout my career. I'm thankful to every single one of them.\n\"We all have to thank Roman Abramovich. I'd like to thank him and all the board. He's the best owner in world football.\"\nSunderland bow out with a whimper\nSunderland's fate was sealed with four games still to go this season and this result ensured they ended their decade in the Premier League with a run of three straight defeats.\nThe Black Cats lost 11 of their last 14 matches, winning just once, and failed to score in 11 of them.\nThey have now finished bottom of the Premier League three times - an unwanted record matched only by Nottingham Forest.\nSunderland were always going to struggle to disrupt Chelsea's title party - even more so when an injury ruled out top-scorer Defoe, who is unlikely to still be at the club when they begin next season's Championship campaign.\nThey had only 29% possession at Stamford Bridge and managed just four touches of the ball in the Blues' box.\nDavid Moyes, who signed a four-year deal when he joined Sunderland last summer, insists he will remain as Black Cats boss next season, although there has been no word from the club yet on his future.\nThis was the Scot's 499th Premier League game as a manager. If he does stay at the Stadium of Light it will take a major rebuilding job this summer if he is to reach 500 any time soon.\nMan of the match - Willian (Chelsea)\nSunderland quick out of the blocks - the stats you need to know\nSunderland have lost 23 Premier League games against the Blues; against no other side have they lost more (also 23 defeats v Manchester United).\nJavier Manquillo's goal, timed at 2:46, was Sunderland's fastest in the Premier League since Wahbi Khazri v Manchester United on 13 February 2016 (2:28).\nManquillo's goal was his first in his 67th appearance in league football (Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Marseille and Sunderland).\nChelsea have kept just one clean sheet in their last eight Premier League home games (3-0 v Middlesbrough).\nMichy Bathsuyai scored his five Premier League goals from just eight shots on target this season.\nWhat next?\nSunderland begin preparing for the Championship while Chelsea go in pursuit of a double at Wembley next Saturday when they take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final."

Alli and Son Heung-min have both reached double figures in the league and the exceptional Christian Eriksen set up two of the seven goals to reach 15 assists for the season.\nThey finished as the division's top scorers with 86 and also boasted the most frugal defence - conceding a club record low 26 goals.\nCan Hull bounce back?\nHull's fate was already decided before their season finale, with the Tigers heading back to the Championship 12 months after they reached the top flight via the play-offs.\nHull have had more managers than away league wins since that victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley, and the club's ability to bounce straight back may well depend on whether they can keep hold of the man who was in charge when their relegation to English football's second tier was confirmed.\nMarco Silva was handed the unenviable task of taking over a Tigers side sitting bottom of the league in January but, with three games to go, looked to have secured their top-flight future before defeats by Sunderland and Crystal Palace.\nThe former Sporting Lisbon and Olympiakos boss is reportedly in demand and yet to decide his future at the KCOM Stadium. But whoever is in charge next season, the Tigers will have to show a lot more fight than they did on Sunday.\nHull goalkeeper David Marshall was given little protection as Alli, Wanyama and Alderweireld all found themselves unmarked when adding to Kane's hat-trick.\nClucas was one of the Tigers' better players and squeezed an effort past Hugo Lloris, but it was Tottenham defender Davies who scored the pick of the goals as he lashed in from outside the box.\nSpurs on their way to Wembley\nTottenham's season may have ended without a trophy, but Pochettino's men are the most successful side to have graced White Hart Lane since the Premier League began.\nIn fact, on eight previous occasions Spurs' points total of 86 would have been enough for them to win the competition.\nHaving won 17 of their 19 home league games it was Spurs', at times, stuttering away form that saw them unable to keep pace with champions Chelsea, but that seems to have been addressed with 13 goals in their final two games on the road.\nAchieving a highest top-flight finish since 1962-63 was a fitting way for Tottenham to end their 118-year stay at the Lane, though, and Pochettino and chairman Daniel Levy's focus now turns to whether Spurs can replicate that form at Wembley.\nThe Argentine, who has already said the north-London club will not compete with those offering huge wages to transfer targets, will be desperate to see the core of this young side still intact once Tottenham move into their new 61,000-seater stadium come the 2018-19 season.\nKane, Alli, Eriksen and Alderweireld's performances against Hull will only have further enticed any interested parties, with Spurs' challenge now to stop their top performers being lured away when Europe's richest clubs begin to flex their financial muscles.\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\n'Harry is one of the best in the world'\nManager Marco Silva on his Hull City future: \"It is a difficult decision. I have something in my mind and need to see what is best for me as well as the club.\n\"Now is the moment to analyse to see what is the best decision.\n\"We didn't want to finish like we did today. We didn't play, our fans deserve more.\"\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am very happy, very pleased with the way we finished the season. It was important for us. Now we are ready to try and take good decisions for the team, try to improve.\n\"We are very excited for Wembley. It is important to rest, recover. This season was tough. It is important to be fresh for next season.\n\"For me, Harry [Kane] is amazing for the team, scoring goals, and is one of the best strikers in the world.\n\"The key players feel the same as I feel. Some players will come and some will leave the club.\"\nTottenham hit the 400 mark - the stats\nTottenham are the fifth Premier League side to register 400 wins (D247 L315).\nSpurs are the third team to score seven or more goals in an away Premier League game [Man Utd 8-1 v Nottm Forest in Feb '99 and Nottm Forest 7-1 v Sheff Weds in Apr '95].\nHull have conceded seven goals for the first time in the top flight and for the first time in league football since October 1990 [1-7 v West Ham in the second tier].\nChristian Eriksen has provided more assists in a single Premier League season than any other Spurs player (15).\nHarry Kane is the sixth player to score a hat-trick in successive Premier League appearances and first since Wayne Rooney in 2011.\nKane has netted four Premier League hat-tricks this season; only Alan Shearer managed more in a single campaign in the competition [five in 1995-96].\nWhat's next?\nTottenham fly to Hong Kong on Monday for a five-day post-season tour before taking up residency at Wembley, while Hull City begin to plan for life in the Championship."

The players responded fantastically and it was a big team effort.\n\"Ultimately, the objective was to keep the team in the league. For me, there were more wins than that. We created a great team spirit. I think the club is on its way back to getting its identity back.\n\"I don't think this squad needs a big overhaul. Given the points we put on at the end of the season, I don't think we need major surgery. Next year we've got to build on from the momentum we've gathered. This squad has a lot of potential and I'm glad in the second half of the season we were able to play closer to it.\"\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"I'm desperately disappointed the lads have got nothing out of the game today, because they deserved it.\n\"Their first goal is shocking defending from us. For the first hour, I thought we controlled the game. The lads have worked really hard this year. We've got punished in both [final] thirds of the pitch at the end of this season.\n\"I'm more concerned about making clubs better, wherever you finish. We've done better than what we did the previous year.\""
